If that hadn’t worked the cookies were the next stop. Oh and notice the dell cookie
on the 13 August 2004, it connects (time wise) to some images in the Internet
Explorer History directory they show Dell 2400 desktop system 33 – wonder if the
user was getting frustrated with their slow and dated operating system that was
creaking under all the additional program running. These were drawn together in a
search for all text files, as the investigator looked for logs etc, notice again how the
numbers of log files and other text files modified and created and created comes to a grinding
halt in 2 days.

on the other day of August 2005, while depositing some refuse at the local tip a computer
was found discarded. Inquiries with the local operative revealed that the system
had been left there the previous day. Without opening the system up, a payment of
£3 (approx ~$5) was requested from the site manage, as contribution to their ‘tea
fund’. Later investigations revealed the system to be an excellent purchase as can
be seen:

The system was the removed from the facility and returned to an examination area
(investigators garage)where it was catalogued and photographed. Notice the
electrical safety check record (dated 16 April 02 to expire 16 April 03) hinting to a

This hints strongly of a system that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this had been found, the forensic investigator turned his
attention to the other information that could be obtained from the system as to its
usage, the owner and the type of use the system was put to the home user where this was taken on Tuesday 31st
August 2004 ie the tower case and this was drawn from the
electrical safety check record.

Encryption

All operating systems are offering built-in encryption facilities nowadays. It is easy for the user to
activate a full disk encryption for a system drive. If possible passwords or encryption keys should
either be obtained by the suspect or should be acquired by using live data forensics on scene. It
can also be helpful to extract other passwords (e.g. browser passwords) from the disk where
possible. These passwords or images can be used to create a dictionary to conduct an
attack using specialised password cracking techniques.
3.2.2.2.9

Unallocated areas

Unallocated areas can contain artefacts of all of the types of evidence mentioned above. Searching
and extracting of certain file types in unallocated areas can be automated by carving software.
Digital forensics analysts should precisely specify what kind of files they are searching for because
data carving is a very time consuming task. Data carving does not work well on fragmented files.
Most of the times data found in unallocated areas cannot be an associated with a certain user or
even a location within a folder structure.
3.2.1.2.10 Cloud/remote storage

In situations where the forensic analysts finds traces of cloud services being used on a computer
system this might mean that evidential data might not only be stored on that machine but on
a remote storage. In some jurisdictions, the growing popularity of
“allocated space” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts are very likely to Any IP Address in the live area of the criminal justice system. In some jurisdictions, the growing popularity of
“allocated Meta" data” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well.

Office documents

In order to analyse documents the forensic analyst could conduct an
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst
47

Digital Forensics Guide

can search for further evidence of when those documents have been produced, by which user they
have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons.
3.3.2.2.2.2.2.1

Pictures / videos

Most forensics software solutions offer support for analysing masses of pictures and videos. After
an initial file signature analysis and setting a filter for pictures and video files, the forensics analyst
can use a gallery view to inspect the thumbnails of all pictures for case relevant evidence. For a
faster analysis of video files certain software offers the feature of extracting still pictures from the
videos (e.g. every X seconds/minutes depending on the settings). These extracted images can then
be viewed in a gallery view as well.
If the case and file size is expected to be the same result, the forensic analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst
