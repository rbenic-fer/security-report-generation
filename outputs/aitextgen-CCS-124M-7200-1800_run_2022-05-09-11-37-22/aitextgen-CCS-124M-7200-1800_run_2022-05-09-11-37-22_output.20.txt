the system (upon boot), on 11 Aug 2005 then over the next few days a further 23
scans were imitated. This would indicate a failing of either the physical disk, the
operating system or the presence of some software that was causing the system to
crash, whereupon reboot a scandisk would automatically be invoked (and
conducted unless cancelled by the user).
