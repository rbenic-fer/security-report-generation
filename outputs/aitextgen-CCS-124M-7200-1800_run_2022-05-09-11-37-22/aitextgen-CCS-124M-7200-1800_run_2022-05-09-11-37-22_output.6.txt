e.g. by implementing write-blocking software
All operating systems are offering built-in encryption facilities nowadays. It is easy for the user to
activate a full disk encryption for a system drive. If possible passwords or encryption keys should
either be obtained by the suspect or should be acquired by using live data forensics on scene. It
can also be helpful to extract other passwords (e.g. by recovering deleted files, mounting containers, breaking encryption, parsing
application data like internet history, chat logs, etc.).
In cases where unallocated data and interception of content data are widespread. Fingerprint forgery
 purposes are:
the use of dedicated software (e.g. ZIP, RAR, etc)

Analysing computer systems

Computer systems are used by humans for all sorts
 activities: writing documents, accounting, e-mails, gaming, viewing and editing images and videos and videos and
so on. That is why they can hold a lot of evidential data. Analysing a computer system, the digital
forensics analyst can typically not only find traces in relation to the case but could potentially also
find evidence regarding the intention of a perpetrator (e.g. by finding internet searches on how to
commit the crime).
3.4.1.1.1.1 Categories of digital traces
Just as a criminal leaves physical traces behind at a crime scene, the criminal that commits a crime
by computer will leave traces at that same time.
To avoid this, it is important to distinguish between two types of digital traces:
Avoidable traces: These are traces that are stored by the operation system and applications by
default, but which the system can be easily copied. Depending on the operating system that has been used on

During this analysis, Stroz Friedberg employed a methodology tailored to the particular
facts of this case. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included: (1) conducting keyword and
other searches of the digital forensic copies of the Ceglia Media and other data,
including webmail accounts, to identify responsive documents or fragments of
documents; (2) manually reviewing the documents containing keyword hits, certain
unsearchable file types, such as image files with no text, including “RJLocate and identify any”
cftt to the file structure and other documents to
determine whether they were relevant to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails; and (3) reviewing the digital forensic copies of the
Ceglia Media for digital forensic artifacts relevant to the authenticity of the Work for
Hire Document or the Purported Emails.

Findings
No exact copies of the Work for Hire Document were found on the Ceglia Media,
which comprised hundreds of pieces of media - including computers, hard drives and
floppy disks. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included that all three of the Ceglia Media’s
hard drive to the inside of the Compaq Presario Media (this will be completed twice, once for each).
Instead of the purported Work for Hire Document, Stroz Friedberg found on the Ceglia Media that are authentic. Many of the Purported Emails
reflect the back of the sheet to claim that all three of the Word documents
containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date of the document and time stamps of the documents to be created, such as
pemails (if required) or from the “Ceglia Media” subreference number of documents in the form of
mbox files.

With online music purchasing increasing exponentially in the UK, the user may
have an external device or other system where they legally acquire the files.
However, it is the belief of the investigator that given the other files in these folders
(ie pornography) which are unlikely to be ‘purchased’ these music videos were also
downloaded via the peer-to-peer software especially as there were 4 different types
of peer-to-peer applications.

the forensic examiner to access live and deleted data.
In the later stages of the Forensic Workstation, the forensic investigator
will be dealing with three additional types
of data, however this is currently a valid method in order to
manipulate and more prone to alteration than traditional forms of evidence. For
this reason it is imperative that the data that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN card or memory card. This plan should include the acquisition of data from the SIM /
IDEN card(s) and memory card(s) (if applicable) and what level of exam is going to be undertaken
and why. The examiner should also plan a second level of exam in case the first level of exam is
not successful due to various difficulties, i.e. a broken or ineffective power button (see chapter
3.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.9, and (not a destination) reviewing the device to make sure the device is still present. In such cases the official channels can be used in order to
the device’s logical board and the soldering of connections to the
devices. The screenshot below confirms the presence of a searchable
examination.
Open the up server, the forensic examiner could search for a full physical copy of the device, however manual verification of the
data and this is often necessary. A number of available tools to assist this in many cases.
In addition to this, the logical acquisition of the SIM/IDEN card data
card should be undertaken to ensure the integrity of the data that is live and accessible to the user.Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN card or “Jail Breaking” the device. This plan should include the acquisition of data from the SIM/IDEN card(s) and memory card(s) (if applicable) and what level of exam is going to be undertaken
and why. The examiner should also plan a second level of exam in case the first level of exam is
not successful due to various difficulties, i.e. a broken or ineffective power button (see chapter
3.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.3). The device will
help to power source to the mobile device and so as to isolate the device
from the mobile network. However, the majority of devices which contain SIM/IDEN card require it
to be present within them when they are powered on or they are susceptible to data loss. To
combat this, it is necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN devices are common.
At this stage, if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination, this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic examiner to access live and deleted data. A physical
examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic examiner to access live and deleted data. A physical
examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card, but if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
