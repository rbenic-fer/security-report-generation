A copy of the recovered floppy disk image was made and an
examination of the floppy disk contents was made and an
copy of the content was created and an MD5 Sum performed
on the working copy forensic image. This MD5 sum was requested on Tuesday 31st and this was drawn from a

security and reliability patches applied. The workstation used was a Dell [Dell]

operationally sound in that they will represent accurately all data they process and
display. The image of the laptop has been retained for future use and reference
should it be required.

(TSK), the newer version (v2.03) of Autopsy could not be loaded onto the Forensics
System (lib failure with Fedora Core 2 (FC2)). TSK is a collection of command line
tools that have been adapted and modified from their original release in the form of
‘The Coroner’s Toolkit7 (TCT). Autopsy is a graphical front end to TSK that uses perl
to interprets the user’s actions and builds the TSK commands in the background.
The user interface is via a standard web browser but output is graphical with logs,
recovered files, md5 hashes, timeline output etc being stored in a user definable
mounted file structure. All these tools are available from <www.sleuthkit.org>.

These programs (Autopsy and The Sleuth Kit) are reputable open source Forensics
tools, that themselves have both been subjected to Forensics Analysis to ensure
they do not alter or corrupt data being analysed. The output from the Autopsy is in
the form of test files that are stored in a folder designated by the initial investigator.
These test files are created and md5 hashes performed on each as they are written
to the HDD. The md5 hash is stored with the output and then the output is
displayed for the investigator. All hashes for the Master Working and the
forensics is MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256. The md5 hash is stored with the output and then the output is
displayed for the investigator. All
