Furthermore, any unauthorised intrusion or coercive measure
will most certainly lead to the inadmissibility of evidence.
Once the forensic analysts finds traces of the evidence it is in the hands of the judge
(rarely – prosecutors), and examiners should be ready such a development. In such cases it will be very
important that information presented by examiners to prosecutors about the
acquisition and actions needed includes all relevant facts in an understandable manner
indicating clearly the connection with the crime under investigation.
Examiners should understand a prosecutor’s questions and directions, comment on
them, provide further information and be prepared to extend the acquisition to other
hardware and software if technically and legally possible.
Presentation of extracted evidence and established facts represents the final stage and
goal of the whole process and will be covered in more detail later on in this Guide.

Acquisition stage

Electronic evidence needs to be acquired in a forensically sound manner. Acquisition of data is
typically conducted by collecting volatile data from a running computer system during a search, or
by acquiring a storage medium from a seized computer or in any other stage during an
investigation. The application of specifically defined and tested procedures at the acquisition step is
crucial as there is an enormous scope for irreversible errors to be made. It is important to keep the
chain of custody intact at any stage to verify the
acquisition and to verify all images and
copies that were acquired.
The intangible nature of any data and information stored in electronic form makes it much easier to
manipulate and more prone to alteration than traditional forms of evidence. This has created
special challenges for the justice system, which requires that such data have to be handled in a
special way to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
Similar to other types of forensic evidence, the correct acquisition and handling of electronic
evidence are vital to the outcome of a case. Close attention must be paid to ensure that the
general guidelines are followed at all times:
Handling by specialists: Every kind of electronic device has its own specific
characteristics that require the correct and appropriate procedures must be applied. One
of the greatest risks is the unintentional modification of the evidence. Failure to adhere to
approved procedures is likely to lead to formal challenges in court about data integrity
that can undermine or invalidate the evidence.
Rapid evolution of electronic evidence sources: New technologies are invented and
develop very quickly. Consequently the procedures and techniques to be applied to them
also need to be constantly reviewed and updated.
Use of proper procedures, techniques and tools: As in more traditional forensic
disciplines, digital forensic specialists require special tools and knowledge to undertake
their investigations properly. It is imperative that the correct techniques and tools are
used for the situations encountered. The procedures must also be auditable and
repeatable by other specialists if the information obtained is to have evidential value.
Admissibility: Since the ultimate goal is to use evidence to prove or disprove disputed
facts, electronic evidence must be obtained in compliance with existing legislation and
best practice to ensure admissibility at trial.

Before even considering starting the acquisition process either the laboratory manager or the
exhibit officer must check whether the proper permission for a data acquisition exists.

30

Digital Forensics Guide

If proper permission exists, special attention should be given to the correct handing over of the
exhibits. Particular attention should be given to the following aspects:


Are all exhibits tagged?



Are all exhibits labels filled out completely and correctly?



Is the exhibit register complete and correct?



Is the chain of custody thoroughly documented?



Are there any damages to the exhibits? If so, have they been documented?



Are all security seals intact?



All exhibits, including the internal storage media should be photographed.

Acquisition of computer systems

In order to preserve the integrity of the original evidence, forensic imaging technicians and digital
forensics analysts should acquire the storage media of a computer system in a forensically sound
manner as described in this chapter. The aim of the acquisition of a computer system is to produce
an identical copy or image of the original data without changing the original evidence. This forensic
copy will
====================
It is recommended that 
the use of recognised
data in the analysis phase will be the first encounter of the digital forensic laboratory
with the electronic evidence in a criminal case. Often, this contact will happen during
the on call duty and maybe during late hours. With an increasing role of prosecutors
within criminal law systems, they are in charge that the law, the
evidential safeguards and the general forensic and procedural principles are followed to the letter.
Therefore, the authenticity of electronic evidence will
be needed at different stages to the criminal justice process. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics analysis with the criminal law framework, the
evidential safeguards and the general forensic and procedural principles in the criminal justice system of the criminal justice system. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics analysis with the criminal law framework, but in some jurisdictions not only the
 criminal law framework, but very often about laws and
by-laws which are regulating telecommunications, service provider operations, information
technology, hardware, software, hardware and data in substantive
and procedural parts of the legal framework. Also, in some jurisdictions, the growing popularity of
“deferred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well.

means that the defence is likely to engage with the execution of search warrants and
engage in ‘on site’ acquisitions and analysis – they will require an ‘on site’ kit (see appendix B for
an exemplary configuration of a device carrying case). In addition to this, the laboratory will be dealing with three additional types
of storage issues; the original evidence, the forensically created images and the data generated
after the analysis. Consideration must be given as to how this is all to be stored, archived and
backed up. A stringent back up and archive regime should be implemented to offer resilience.
If any of the digital forensic team are likely to assist with the execution of search warrants and
engage in ‘on site’ acquisitions and analysis – they will require an ‘on site’ kit (see appendix B for
an exemplary configuration of a device carrying case). In addition to a portable workstation or
laptop and the imaging tools, consideration must be given for purchasing the following equipment:


Property bags, security tags and exhibit labels



Torch



Screw drivers



Sterile gloves and clothing



Exhibit register updated



Exhibit forms and chain of exit to assist with maintaining the continuity of the
evidence within. The simplest way to do this is to have a witnessed signing in/out book book but this
requires a second person to be always present. Other types of access control include physical locks
and keys, electronic keypads, swipe cards, CCTV and biometrics.
The premises should, ideally be alarmed with motion sensors in each room and at each entry point
(external doors and windows). The windows and doors should be re-enforced to prevent nonauthorised entry and theft and be covered to prevent observation of from external sources.
Fire detection and ‘dry’ fire quenching is also important to be. There are physical and virtual
devices available that can be used to fire
or altered through environmental
factors such as excessive heat or through the presence of electromagnetic
fields.

3.2.2.2.2.2.2.3

Size

When considering the size of any laboratory, considerations that account for the various tasks that
will be conducted within must be made. It is best practice to try and segregate the specific types of
activities to prevent cross contamination and loss of exhibits.
A reception type area where evidence can be delivered or collected without allowing access to the
actual laboratory should be incorporated in the planning of the digital forensic laboratory. A high
priority is the need for a secure area to store exhibits and sensitive data. This should be a room
located within the digital forensic laboratory. Alternatively a fixed metal cage could be used, used,
depending on the amount of exhibits likely to be stored. Any access to and removal or return of
exhibits to the storage room must be recorded. As with access to the laboratory,
====================
It is recommended that  the laboratory be involved in the recruiting of the staff that will be employed to carry out the
different roles within the laboratory.
Depending on the size of the laboratory and the required number of staff they must consider the
different functions that are required. Staff roles and responsibilities will need to be documented and
detailed job descriptions should be prepared so that each member of the team has a clear
understanding of their job profile job profile. Where possible the structure of a digital forensics capability
should incrementally allow for staff to be able to advance within the organisation, rather than
leaving. It is accepted that this is only possible within a facility with plentiful resources, however it
should always be an aim. There is strong anecdotal evidence that shows in many digital forensics
laboratories highly qualified staff spend much of their time undertaking mundane tasks below their
level of capability. To avoid this, it is important to recognise the activities to be undertaken should
be clearly defined in the job profiles. The roles and responsibilities that should be considered
include the following:
Laboratory manager
The manager must have some advanced technical knowledge and a certain
understanding of the overarching principles described in the
Electronic Evidence Guide.
Administration
The role and responsibility of the laboratory Technical is to take forensically sound copies (images) of computer hard
drives and other storage media. Depending on the size of the laboratory, several technicians may
be required. The Forensic Workstation
Backing up the same result in the hands of a search of any
personnel within the laboratory. In some jurisdictions, the
examiner should have certain skills for verbal presentations. The other laboratory will need to have certain skills and an
understanding of the various methods of forensically acquiring digital data. A court
will need to decide the level of
procedures to an attached USB medium. This is one of the frequent techniques for prolonging the criminal justice system, the trial
of the findings and testing of the believability will most probably occur. In such cases the official training option will need to be
adjudicating and the staff’s preference. Appendix A shows an exemplary matrix
that shows how a lab manager can create a comparison between different forensic software
products taking into account the functionality as well as the cost of purchase, license renewal and
training.
It is worthy of note that some digital forensics analysts can conduct entire investigations with the
use of open source software – however there
 is a lack of support and training opportunities
with these types of product. Many jurisdictions and standards will require ‘dual tool verification’ (e.g. mandatory list of court-validated software). While one lab might have a majority of cases involving recovery of files and the lack of
write knowledge (e.g. mandatory list of court-validated software). While one lab might only have cases where large amounts of documents and e-mails might need to be analysed. While the first laboratory might choose one particular forensic
software that suits their requirements (excellent data carving, file system support) the other laboratory might only be cases where large amounts of documents and e-mails might need to be analysed. While the first laboratory might choose one particular forensic
software that suits their requirements (excellent data carving, file system support and recovery capabilities) the other laboratory might aim for another solution that fits their demands
better. There cannot be one definite recommendation for a specific software that is the the a quality of
the evidence it is important to used. There is one definite recommendation for a
-forensic software that is the the the outmost cost of the forensic examination so as to have a
understanding of the cost of licensing, the laboratory may need to provide a better overview
over the main areas of the digital forensic laboratory.

It is likely that many prosecutors and even a smallernumber of judges will be needed to render lawful
decisions about the fate of the case and it’s perpetrator. In some jurisdictions, the

Software – It is important to consider that there is not only the initial purchase but the
ongoing cost of licensing, support and training, associated with most
technical staff. The initial and ongoing cost of licenses can be significant and research should be
undertaken before purchase to ensure the hardware and software being obtained correctly matches
the initial purchase and software being obtained correctly matches
the laboratories and the staff’s preference.
