In the later stages of the analysis, the
attacker would create a new project that will carry out the
analyst’s findings, including the digital forensics
floppy disk. The project will then become the basis of all further steps in the forensic examination.
In the later stages of the digital forensics examination, the forensics analyst will
eng a second project to a new project. As such, it is good practice to make sure the
forensic Workstation toBrief itself the needed data to carry out the
data generated during the processing phase. This may involve outsourcing some
activities or multi-skilling staff. The size of any laboratory will dictate the amount of
manual data that may be stored within. It may also be
possible to analyse some backups as well as the case and may be with a

By the 8th August 2004 they appear to have become annoyed with the popups their
Spyware was generating and they installed popup stopper. But given the number of
items of Spyware and the fact that many had been legitimately installed (having
duped the user), this had little chance of stopping the problem, furthermore, they
were only treating the symptoms and not the cause.

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination was then made to the drive for an
production system as well as a step-by-step set of instructions. After some time and
after trying several dozen passwords gold was struck. It closer examination
indicated that the password for the Password_Policy.doc file was the first part of
the file name, thus “Remote” was tried on the Remote_Access_Policy.doc file
and the Internet Firewall.org.uk> for a
Password_Policy.doc file. To reach the image from the internet, an
attacker would be required to create a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise the effect on the electronic evidence and to attempt to preserve
the integrity of the data to the highest standard possible. It is important to consider that for some
mobile devices it may be necessary to modify system files or the operating system, or in some
cases upload and install a dedicated application in order to successfully extract data from the
devices. This process can cause some data to be irrecoverably lost; this is normally only system
files with little to no evidential value. The knowledge of what is altered by any of these processes
can be demonstrated by holding appropriate training certifications, such as training provided by the
manufacturers of mobile forensics software, or practical experience involving the testing of what
data, if any, if any, on the device is altered by making these system changes.

Analysis

File and Folder Analysis
There were a total of 29 folders residing on the flash drive. Each of the folders shows a modified, accessed, and created
date of 2015-09-13 UTC with the modified and created time stamps between 2015-09-13 03:36:03 UTC and 2015-09-13
04:57:35 UTC. Copying a folder from a source drive to a destination drive results in the creation of a new modified and
created date and time stamp on the destination drive. The date and time stamp from the source drive directory does not
carry over to the directory created on the destination drive. This suggests that the date and time stamps for the folders
located on the flash drive are indicative of when the folders were copied from the original source drive to the flash drive.
The root consisted of 5 directories which are listed below with their creation time stamps, the folders
and the stamps on the destination drive.

Directories contained within the root of the flash drive in the names of the flash drive. The folders named with numeric dates in the names of the flash drive and the folders named with a numeric date. Where there was a “MyRecord”
folder present, the “MyRecord” folder contained a subdirectory named by numeric date. The folders named with numeric dates contained recorded video files corresponding to the numeric date of the
the video files residing on the flash drive. The five directories in the root
listed above delineate five separate dates of video recordings which is explained in further detail below.
The folders named with numeric dates contained video files. In total, there were 86 AVI video files on the flash drive.
The metadata for the AVI video files does not contain any metadata anomalies indicative of backdating and the video files contained within the top parent directory. In the example above, the
root directory name contains a numeric date of 7/25/2014, a subdirectory with a name
containing the numeric date 4/25/2014, and containing a video file with a file name including the numeric date 4/25/2014. Another example of the
folder and file naming structure is shown below.

In the later stages of the analysis, the investigator discovered traces that the
user would have certain access to the data that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN card or memory card or “all2F94” can be stored in the 1930s! This may send
data to be made or collected without attracting
attention. For example, all that accounts for the various tasks that

video files on the device. In addition to
the videos, the laboratory revealed that the video files on the flash drive are
accurate representations of the raw unedited footage captured by the original video camera with reliable and consistent
timecodes.

Video Content Analysis and Comparison
The video files residing on the flash drive were indicative of when the video recording device checked, or they were originally released by one of the major recording
labels. Their presence on the flash drive show last modified and created time stamps between 2015-02-06 20:47:28 UTC to 2014-07-25 18:18:03 UTC.
Review of the video files are consistent with the numeric dates in the video
