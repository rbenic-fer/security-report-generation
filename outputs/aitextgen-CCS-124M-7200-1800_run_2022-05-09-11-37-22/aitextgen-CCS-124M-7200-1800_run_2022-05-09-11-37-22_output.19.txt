Of note are that this is not without risk, the property store or if not stored securely within the
handset. If property store exists, a bit-to-bit clone of the device will be created and
that clone inserted into the handset. It is good practice to not only have one data available at a forensic lab but also another off-site backup.
While the digital forensic analyst is conducting the analysis with his working copy of the device
there should still be a backup stored on another level of access.

If the aim of the acquisition process is to a physical copy of the encrypted data good
data, particularly in serious cases. Any access to and removal or return of
exhibits to the storage room must ensure the integrity of the
data to the highest standard possible. In such cases the official channels can be used in order to
manipulate and access to the data that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN card or memory card. This plan should include the possibility that some exhibits or data are not present and that the
device notes the presence of a SIM/IDEN card, but yet is still not able to communicate with any
mobile networks (for further isolation methods, see chapter 3.2.2.2.2.2.2.1). It is worth noting, if a device
used an IDEN card, it is often necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN card, serial number or pattern.
At this stage, if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination, this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card, this will be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular to allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should

attempt the best level of examination possible whilst bypassing the protection. If this is not
possible, the user’s PIN, password or pattern will be required prior to the device and so forth.

The best level of examination possible whilst bypassing the protection. If this is not
possible, the user’s PIN, password or pattern will be required prior to defeat the protection. If the PIN, pattern is already known prior to the protection, then this should be entered so that full
access can be gained to the device. Again, the best level of examination should be undertaken to
get the most data extracted out of the device. If obtaining the correct level of protection is
not possible it may be necessary to attempt typical PINs or patterns in order to access the data.
This is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct level of exam is in place to the passcodes.
This is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong level of

This is currently a topical subject both in cases of attacks against the

Once the laboratory staff are recruited, it is important to circulate

There is a risk from flood, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).

Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise the effect on the electronic evidence and to attempt to preserve
the integrity of the data to the highest standard possible. It is important to consider that for some
mobile devices it may be
