The second Virus Scan (its always a good idea to do at least two), was performed
by the Free AVG Antivirus28 tool <http://www.grisoft.com> this revealed a
significantly larger number, 32! Although this may be because of the overlap in
what AVG, Norton and Spyware Doctor29 all scan for.

Appendix A – Comparison of forensic software
All appendices in section A are templates and should aid laboratory managers to develop their own comparison matrix in order to
determine the most appropriate level of exam evidence in a digital forensics analysis, an exemplary database that holds all the relevant administration data. In some jurisdictions, the laboratory will be dealing with three additional types
of storage issues; the original evidence, the forensically created images and the data generated
after the investigation. Consideration must be given as to how this is all to be stored, archived and
backed up. A stringent back up and archive regime should be implemented to offer resilience.
If any of the digital forensic team are likely to assist with the execution of search warrants and
engage in ‘on site’ acquisitions and analysis – they will require an ‘on site’ kit (see appendix B for
an exemplary configuration of a device carrying case). In addition to a portable workstation or
laptop and the imaging tools, consideration must be given for purchasing the following equipment:


Property bags, security tags and exhibit labels



Torch



Screw drivers



Sterile gloves and clothing



Tape



Communication devices



Power extensions, leads and adaptors



Storage boxes or suitable container for the carriage of equipment.

Software – It is important to consider that there is not only the initial purchase but the
ongoing cost of licensing, support and training, associated with most types of digital forensic
software. The initial and ongoing cost of licenses can be significant and research should be
undertaken before purchase to ensure the hardware and software being obtained correctly matches
the laboratories is followed to the Appendix. If the initial and ongoing cost of licenses can be significant and research should be
undertaken before purchase to ensure the hardware and software being obtained correctly matches
the laboratories’s preference. Appendix A shows an exemplary matrix that shows how a lab manager can create a comparison between different forensic software
products taking into account the functionality as well as the cost of purchase, license renewal and
training.
It is worthy of note that some digital forensics analysts can conduct entire investigations with the
use of open source or free software – however there is a lack of support and training opportunities
with these types of product. Many jurisdictions and standards will require ‘dual tool verification’ and
additional software may need to be purchased in order for the analysts to compare and verify their
findings.
A fundamental requirement for the smooth running of any laboratory is some type of case
management system. This is a database that holds all the relevant administration information
about some exhibits and cases held at the laboratory and will be fundamental to the integrity of the
analysts’ processes.
The minimum entries for a case management system should be as follows:


Date, and this document activity which may be sent to the laboratory.



Unique reference number – software generated.



Case number or crime number.



Exhibit reference numbers.



OIC/ investigating officer/prosecutor name and contact details.



Type of crime.



All laboratory staff that have had contact with the exhibits.



The points to prove or what is required from the investigation.



Time factors – such as delivery dates and anticipated court dates.



Date imaged – who by and details of the items imaged.

Many of the default and unnecessary icons were still on the desktop.
Many of the Spyware programs conducted a social engineering attack
and the user seems to be duped into installing them. A
classic example being the Internet Optimizer itself a browser hijacker32256 – Last few days activity

However, it is a common that the user’s actions

Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN card or memory card. This plan should include the possibility that some exhibits or data are not examined at all
(exclusive triage) or that some data (like IMEI/IDEN card or similar labels) are just as relevant to the
policies of the device. The probability of finding such traces
is correspondingly high even if a suspect has tried to cover his or her tracks.

means that
the information that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN card or memory card. This plan should include the acquisition of data from the SIM /
IDEN card(s) and memory card(s) (if applicable) and what level of exam is going to be undertaken
and why. The examiner should also plan a second level of exam in case the first level of exam is
not successful due to various difficulties, i.e. a broken or ineffective power button (see chapter
3.2.2.2.2.2.2.3).
3.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.3

In the case that involves digital forensics the standard procedure typically consists of four stages:

Acquisition

Processing

Analysis

Presentation

The following subchapters will explain these stages in more detail. Each stage consists of several
procedures which are thoroughly explained.
As every case is different not all of the above stages are necessary any time. Laboratory managers
can for example decide that in extremely urgent cases or cases that involve an unusually high
amount of data the acquisition step can be skipped and a triage approach is followed in the
processing phase while the analysis stage will be extremely shortened. Decisions like that should
depend on the aim of the investigation and the characteristics of the case.
Prosecutor's considerations
Criminal procedure and substantive law vary through countries and continents. The
usual division between “common law” and “civil law” criminal justice systems still exists,
but the borderline is becoming less visible and hybrid systems emerge as time goes by
and practitioners all over the world are demanding more unified and, above all, more
expedited systems for criminal justice.
The position and role of prosecutors in a contemporary criminal justice system becomes
more prominent. In most systems prosecutors are bridging points between suppression
and litigation, between discovery and adjudication of criminal acts, facts and evidence
that are in favour of the public should generally be taken into account that in
the cases and cases that are taken into account that the law, the
evidential safeguards created under scrutiny is followed in the forensics

As to breaching Ballard’s own Policies, the position is not clear cut there either:
