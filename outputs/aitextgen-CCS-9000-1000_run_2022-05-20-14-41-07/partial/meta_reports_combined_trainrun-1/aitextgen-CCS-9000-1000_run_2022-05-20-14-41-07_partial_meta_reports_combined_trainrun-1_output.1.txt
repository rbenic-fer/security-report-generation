This report is  published on the SophosLabs blog.  It is important that the company should be aware of the importance of protecting against the latest threats, ensuring that there is a good community of their organisation.

The UK-based company has also been hit by an independent computer security firm, which is said to have confirmed the importance of all staff in the UK.

In the last week or so it is reported that the company has discovered an additional 1,5,8
