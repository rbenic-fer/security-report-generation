How is that blocking happening? How does it block firewalls? Is this something I'm doing that should work, or if it's the correct way to do it? Thanks.

A:

In the firewall configuration file you will find this:
firewall:
    [type: [default] Network]
    [allow-on-ip]
    [allow-on-domain]
    [allow-on-hostname]
    [allow-on-hostname-name]
    [allow-on-password]
    [allow-on-port]
    [allow-on-max-ip-length]
    [allow-on-max-domain-size]
    [allow-on-max-ip-length-allowed]
    [allow-on-server]
    [allow-on-ssl]
    [allow-on-ssl-enabled]
    [allow-on-ssl-name]
    [allow-on-ssl-password]
    [allow-on-ssl-cert]
    [allow-on-ssl-cert-name]

In this section I'm using the "allowed-on-ip" as the first parameter in the "firewall":
firewall:
    [type: [default] Network]
    [allow-on-ip]
    [allow-on-domain]
    [allow-on-hostname]
    [allow-on-hostname-name]
    [allow-on-port]
    [allow-on-max-ip-length]
    [allow-on-max-domain-size]
    [allow-on-max-ip-length-allowed]
    [allow-on-max-domain-size-allowed]
    [allow-on-server]
    [allow-on-ssl]
    [allow-on-ssl-enabled]
    [allow-on-ssl-name]
    [allow-on-ssl-password]
    [allow-on-ssl-cert]
    [allow-on-ssl-cert-name]

In this case I'm using the ip="127.0.0.1" from the "allowed-on-ip" in the "firewall" section as the first parameter.

<thesi> jcw, that is correct. I think you should check for a firewall for a few months before you try to update the firewalls.
<mwenni> hey! so do i just need to run apt-get update && apt-get upgrade when it is run on another host but that fails?
<mwenni> or is it worth upgrading to a newer machine and then having to wait 2 weeks after upgrade if it fails?
<kalikiana> mwenni: i've not tried the upgrade-reboot but i've been hoping to have a similar setup with a new machine, but I think it is a bit premature to say, and in the interest of keeping things running, you could try apt-get update -f when the upgrade is done.
<thesi> mwenni: that's fine. The problem was that I have no internet and I didn't receive any notification of my new machine, I was trying to update the firewalls, and as soon as I was done updating everything started working right away.
<mwenni> kalikiana, you'll have to reboot and try again, if that isn't the case, then you will have to run apt-get upgrade -f when it is done
<mwenni> ok, but I was wondering if the firewall was blocking anything?
<kalikiana> mwenni: ok. so the firewall is blocking a lot of traffic? I've already had a couple days to try and set it up in the firewall, but that just made things a little fuzzy for me.
<kalikiana> mwenni: yes
<mwenni> kalikiana, what you should do is set a "broadcom netfilter" on the server running the firewalls (if they are running on a different network) so that it is not blocking anything
<kalikiana> i have to reboot again and try to upgrade
<mwenni> kalikiana, is there any way to know that if the firewall was blocking things before the firewalls were running?
<kalikiana> mwenni: it is, if I'm running the server on a newer machine, you could try and upgrade in that case
<mwenni> kalikiana, it will work fine if you try and reboot and try again
<mwenni> kalikiana, the firewall will be blocking a lot of traffic on the old machine
<kalikiana> mwenni: but I have to reboot again, so I might be running the upgrade on another machine now
<mwenni> kalikiana, but if you try to restart, try to login again and try again
<mwenni> ok
<kalikiana> mwenni: I don't know if it works, I'll try it and see if it works
<mwenni> ok. I am running on a new machine, so I'm not sure how I should do it.
<mwenni> you should reboot again and try to do the upgrade again
<mwenni> if it's a problem then you should reboot again and try again
<kalikiana> mwenni: ok. I am running on a new machine, so I'm not sure how I should do it.
<mwenni> kalikiana, it's fine, you should reboot again and try again
<kalikiana> mwenni: ok, you will have to reboot again to restart the server.
<kalikiana> mwenni: but if you try to do it again
<kalikiana> i think that is a bad idea, since it's probably going to break my security
<kalikiana> mwenni: I would run the upgrade again with the old machine if it was working fine, but then I'd start back again with a new machine
<kalikiana> mwenni: if it's a problem then you can use apt-get upgrade -f when you are done
<mwenni> kalikiana, then you should reboot and try again, or else you'll have to reboot again
<mwenni> kalikiana, ok. it would work again, I'll run the upgrade again, I think
<kalikiana> mwenni: ok. then, you can reboot again, or you
