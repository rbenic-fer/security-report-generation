In the opinion of the expert,  the evidence is that in October
1936, the government's agents were apprehended and taken into custody
on a state crime of possession charge. The evidence was not of any
character, however, that the United States was involved, other than the
prosecutor's statement that "the state crime of possession" does not
refer to possession of the methamphetamine. In order for the
testimony to be admitted,      the evidence is that "the government agents
have arrested and taken into custody for use of the

In the opinion of the expert,  the Court of Appeals is correct to  grant  a writ of habeas corpus,  because the record was "so  complete and satisfactory  as to warrant the finding that  the  court erred in its  conclusions of law  below."

====================
In the opinion of the expert,  the Court of Appeals is not authorized to substitute its own judgment  for that of the expert in a review of the factual record.  However, the expert was in the position of the court, and as the court's expert, had the opportunity to comment on the facts in   whether the testimony was competent.   See People v. Lott, 21 Cal.2d 674, 677, 93 P.2d 746 (1949).  This court has reviewed the evidence in this case.  We agree with the trial court that, in   the opinion of the expert, the testimony was competent and was not   contrary to or inconsistent with the evidence.    The   evidence, however, is not conclusive.  Thus, the Court of Appeal   is authorized to review this   determination   of the evidence.   See People v. Wolkowski,   12 Cal.App.3d 1, 8, 97   P.2d 844 (1947).
