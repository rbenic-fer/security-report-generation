APT41 is a 
cell-type-specific T cell activation

CD44 is expressed on some CD4^+^ and CD8^+^ T cells; 
it has no effect on the function of T cells.

TGF-β controls T helper cells. {#S4}
=============================

Tregs, macrophages and Treg-like cells are the primary effector cells of T cells, which play a role in the immune response. Tregs are also present in mature effector T cells, such as regulatory T cells and suppressor T cells ([@R17]). They express both IL-10 and MIP-1alpha ([@R18], [@R19]), and contribute to the initiation and progression of the immune response. Treg-like cells are present in some T cell subsets in peripheral blood ([@R20], [@R21]), but little is known about their function in T cells in peripheral tissue.

Tregs have been reported in experimental autoimmune thyroiditis, a disease associated with excessive secretion of cytokines. Tregs are defined as cells with a T helper phenotype characterized by a presence of suppressor T cells that secrete cytokines in the bone marrow ([@R22]). Treg-like cells appear to be at least as important in the induction of inflammation as T cells ([@R16], [@R22]). Several studies have identified the expression of Treg genes, including CD11c and CD11b ([@R13], [@R24], [@R25], [@R26]). The expression of both Treg and regulatory T cells is increased in patients with autoimmunity ([@R12], [@R26], [@R27]).

CD44 has been reported in different parts of the body including in the kidney, heart, lung and small intestine ([@R27], [@R28], [@R29]). It is also expressed on different epithelial cells, including epithelial cells of the colon, esophagus and stomach. The role of CD44 on the immune response has been studied in some diseases including asthma ([@R30], [@R31]), asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus ([@R32], [@R33]).

CD44 was not shown to be associated with autoimmunity, but was more likely to be a marker for T cells. CD44 has a similar specificity for T cells, and has been linked to autoimmunity in several diseases including inflammation ([@R34]).

TGF-β is an endogenous stimulator of the T cell response. It is expressed by a subset of T cells and in particular by T cells of T2D ([@R35], [@R36]). There are a number of T cell-specific TGF-β ligands such as TGF-β~1~ and TGF-β~2~ (e.g. TGF-β~1~-agonist), TGF-β~2~-receptor (anti-FcγR), TGF-β~1~-receptor (e.g. TGF-β~1~-receptor antagonist) and TGF-β~2~-receptor agonists (e.g. TGF-β~2~-receptor agonist).

TGF-β binds to T cell surface receptors. It is a ligand that activates the TGF-β receptor and the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. TGF-β~1~-receptor agonists stimulate T cell proliferation in a different way than TGF-β~2~-receptor agonists ([@R37]). TGF-β~1~ binds to T cells and it stimulates their differentiation and activation ([@R38]).

TGF-β is expressed on some epithelial cells including the gastric epithelium. It is a receptor of TGF-β. It also functions as an immunosuppressant ([@R39]). It binds to T cells and stimulates their differentiation, while blocking cytokine production in T cell activation. The amount of TGF-β in the serum is increased in patients with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) ([@R40]).

TGF-β~1~-receptor antagonists have been described in some clinical trials for the treatment of SLE ([@R41], [@R42]), inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD) ([@R43]), asthma ([@R44]), and in patients with SLE ([@R45]). These drugs block the immune response in part by inhibiting the activation of T cell-mediated cell-mediated immune

====================
APT41 is a 
GTP-dependent, kinase-activating, non-coding RNA, with at least 20,000 amino-acid
sequence homology (<http://www.tandfonline.com/tools/db/citation>). 
This 
GTPase family is known to exist in mammals as well as in a
dividing species.  The
GTP-independent kinase (GIAK) and GTP-binding protein 1 (GIP1)
(also known as GATA3) are
also known to be kinase-dependent 
in human cells. 
GIP1 is one of several members of the GIP/GDP
family and is expressed at high levels in a number of
eukaryotic cells, including the brain, intestine, brain and
muscle. 
GIP1 is also known to exist in human cells, but has not been
defined specifically. 
GIP1 has the same basic amino acid sequence as GIP1 and has
a large degree of conservation with GIP1.  It is
also known to be involved in multiple cellular events including
cell survival, cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation,
cell-cell adhesion, cell cycle, cell cycle-associated protein
transferases, protein kinase R, DNA polymerase A and R, and
phosphorylation of SRC-1 and CPT41 in mammalian cells. 
GIP1 is also known to exist in mammals in both cell types
as well as in the
differentially expressed genes that are involved in
cell cycle. 
As mentioned above,
the function of
GIP1 is not known. 
This is
currently under investigation and is being done to
establish a structural basis for the functional relationship
between GIP1 and GTPases.

====================
APT41 is a erythropoietin (EPO) that regulates platelet aggregation and the subsequent differentiation of thrombocytes into fibrillar platelets. Although it is widely accepted that the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα induces platelet aggregation, the exact mechanism that is responsible for this phenomenon remains unknown. We have examined the mechanisms by which TNFα promotes the release of TNFα by a thrombogenic pathway (P4HT). To address this issue, we have examined whether TNFα also regulates platelet aggregation in the context of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. To accomplish this, we have determined the effect of TNFα on platelet activation (PD-1 and PD-L1 phosphorylation) and PD-L1 phosphorylation (Thr308 phosphorylation) by using in vivo and in vitro platelet activation. To test the effects of TNFα on platelet activation in vivo and in vitro, we have examined the effects of TNFα on PD-L1 phosphorylation and thrombin generation. To determine the mechanism by which TNFα regulates the phosphorylation of PD-L1, we have examined TNFα signaling by using the C-terminal extension assay. We have also examined the effects of TNFα on thrombin generation and PD-L1 phosphorylation. These studies will provide a mechanistic link between TNFα and the platelet-induced platelet activation by IL-6.

APT41 is a

Description

RELATED APPLICATIONS

An electronic monitoring system (EUM) is typically used for monitoring the health of a user. It may include a system for
monitoring a user's heartbeat and/or a signal to be transmitted over the wireless network. The EUM may include a
control channel, a transmitter channel, a receiver channel, a feedback channel, a frequency channel, and/or a signal. In
particular, the control channel is an analog signal with an integer value, and the transmitter channel is a digital
signal. The signal can be modulated into a number of frequency bands, from 1 Hz to 4 KHz, and from 4 KHz to
10 KHz. A signal can be received by a receiver channel, such as a digital channel. The control channel is an analog
signal with an integer value, and the transmitter channel is an analog signal.

Description

RELATED APPLICATIONS

An electronic monitoring system (EUM) may be equipped with a transmitter and/or receiver, or any other device that

A system may be equipped with an integrated circuit (IC) for monitoring, for instance, electrical and/or
motor current. The system is then used to measure the voltage, current, or other information transmitted by the electronic
monitoring device (EMD) associated with the EUM.
