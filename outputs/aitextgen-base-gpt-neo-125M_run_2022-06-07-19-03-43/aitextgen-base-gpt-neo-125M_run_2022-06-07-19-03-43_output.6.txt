The contents of 
the following table are the content of the text of a text file that is to be published in 
a journal in which it is published. The contents of the text file that 
appears in the journal should be in the following format: 
C:\Program Files\Jena\Jena\v20140811\documents\t.xls\documents\t\Jena-P04.txt
 
The text files of which I am currently reading the journal are 

P04.txt 
 
and 
Jena-P04.txt
 
The journal should be published with a title of "Jena" and 
the name of the journal editor is "Jena". If I replace the journal name 
in the text file, and save the journal as the journal name, it is 
published with the title of "Jena" and the title of "Jena". 
However, if I write a new journal name, and replace the journal name in the text file, 
it is not published. I guess I need to have the journal editor defined to publish it. 
In other words, I need to change the name of the journal and the journal editor. 
I have read this page but can not figure it out how to make this change. 
Is there any way to make a change in the name of the journal and journal editor in the text file? 

A:

You can change the name of the journal editor by replacing the journal name by the name of the editor. For example, in this example,
Jena

Introduction {#sec001}
============

The *C*. *elegans* helix 1 (Chi1) gene, encoded by the cystathionine-γ-lyase (CHEN)-encoding gene, is responsible for the structural integrity and replication of the helix \[[@pone.0135690.ref001]\]. The protein of the chitin-binding domain (CD) region is highly conserved and plays a role in the integrity of protein structures \[[@pone.0135690.ref002]\]. However, the CD region is extremely unstable \[[@pone.0135690.ref003]\], resulting in reduced stability of the chitin-binding region, leading to an increased risk of cell damage and infection. The CHEN-binding domain also has a low water solubility, resulting in a low-temperature environment and a low affinity for zinc \[[@pone.0135690.ref004], [@pone.0135690.ref005]\]. The chitin-binding domain of the CD regions is required for a proper folding and stabilization of the CD region and this protein structure is important for the functional stability of chitin-binding proteins \[[@pone.0135690.ref006]\].

The CD region of the chitin-binding domain of the chitin-binding protein CD-1 is crucial for the stability and integrity of its protein structure \[[@pone.0135690.ref007]\]. CD-1 has a higher water solubility and exhibits lower stability when compared to the chitin-binding protein CHEN-1 and has the strongest water solubility of the chitin-binding protein CHEN-1 \[[@pone.0135690.ref008]--[@pone.0135690.ref010]\]. The CD-1 and CHEN-binding domains of CD-1 are required for chitin-binding of CD-1 with low water solubility \[[@pone.0135690.ref011]\]. CD-1 is essential for chitin-binding of CHEN-1 and CD-1 has a relatively low water solubility, resulting in a low-temperature environment and a low affinity for zinc \[[@pone.0135690.ref012], [@pone.0135690.ref013]\]. The CD-1 and CHEN-binding domains of the CHEN-binding protein CD-3 are essential for the binding of CD-3, but have relatively low stability \[[@pone.0135690.ref014], [@pone.0135690.ref015]\].

The CD region of CHEN-binding protein CHEN-1 (CHEN-1) \[[@pone.0135690.ref016]\] is involved in the folding and stabilization of the CD region of CHEN-binding protein CHEN-1 \[[@pone.0135690.ref017]\]. The CD region of CHEN-1 is also essential for the folding and stability of CHEN-binding protein CHEN-1 \[[@pone.0135690.ref015]\]. CHEN-1 has a high water solubility and the protein is hydrophobic, making the protein very prone to aggregation and hydration. However, it is generally not an ideal protein for folding and is generally under better control than CHEN-1 when it is expressed in *Escherichia coli* and *S*. *cerevisiae*, a bacterial cell culture which has the greatest amount of chitin \[[@pone.0135690.ref018]\]. CHEN-1 has a high water solubility and the protein is hydrophobic, making it extremely prone to aggregation \[[@pone.0135690.ref019]\]. However, its crystal structure has been determined with the aid of crystal structures \[[@pone.0135690.ref020]\] and other information obtained. The CD-1 and CHEN-binding domains of CHEN-1 have high water solubility, suggesting that they have an important role for its chitin-binding functions \[[@pone.0135690.ref021]\].

Recently, Chitin-binding protein CD-3 has been characterized and found to be very interesting for its ability to

Abstract

In the present paper, we present the theory of the effect of an optical
field on the evolution of quantum gravity-induced gravity in a medium
with an optical waveguide. We calculate the effect of an optical field
and calculate the effects of different parameters. For two-level
superconducting qubits, we measure the evolution of the entanglement
time of a single-mode entanglement entuning, the one-way entanglement
time of a superposition of entangled states, the one-way entanglement
time of a single-mode entanglement state, and the entanglement entropy.
We also calculate the entanglement entropy.

Abstract

In the present paper, we present the theory of the entanglement entropy of
two-level superconducting qubits, the one-way entanglement entropy of a
single-mode entanglement entuning, and the entanglement entropy of a
single-mode entanglement state. In particular, we study the effect of
optical fields on the entanglement entropy of the entanglement entuning
time of a superposition of entangled states, the entanglement entropy of a
single-mode entanglement entuning, and the entanglement entropy of a
single-mode entanglement state. We also calculate the effect of different
parameters, including the entanglement entropy, which may be obtained by
calculating the entanglement entuning time of the entanglement
entuning with the state of a single-mode state.

Abstract

We present a mathematical and theoretical framework for the description of
the evolution of two-level superconducting qubits with optical field
or optical field, which allows the study of the interaction of a
quantum superconductor with a light field. We present a theory of the
diffractive wavefunction with optical fields and optical field
effects on the evolution of the entanglement entuning time and on
the entanglement entropy.

Abstract

This paper describes a two-dimensional nonlinear field theory based on the
time-evolution of the density matrix. The theory is formulated in terms of
a time-dependent Schrödinger equation that describes the two-level
superconducting qubit (2-LEQ) coupled to a light field. It contains two
branes, which is assumed to couple to each other in the time-dependent
field theory, the optical field. We calculate the effect of different
parameters on the evolution of the entanglement entuning time and on the
entanglement entropy of a single-mode entanglement entuning, the
one-way entanglement entuning time of a superposition of entangled states,
the entanglement entropy of a single-mode entanglement entuning, and the
entanglement entropy of a single-mode entanglement state.

Abstract

We describe the evolution of the entanglement entuning time of a
two-level superconductor coupled to an optical field. We calculate the
theory of the non-classical evolution of the entanglement entuning
time and the entanglement entropy of a single-mode entanglement
state.

Abstract

We introduce a quantum field theory and discuss the effect of a

I'm happy to announce the release of the Open Source "Binary File", an
app that's an open source toolkit that supports data-centric storage.

If anyone's interested in using this, I'll add it.

I can't wait to see how it will impact the world.

~~~
b1hg0d0
This has already been mentioned but I don't believe it will. This app
works on Linux but it's currently not stable enough for any browser to run.

~~~
pjc50
Binary file is an extension to the Unix filesystem. It is not a fully
interactive command, but it works when used as a graphical tool (if you
want).

koolba
This is fantastic and will have a large impact.

~~~
cperciva
And there's some work being done in the last couple of weeks to make this
available for Linux. The code is written in C++, which is very fast.

~~~
hooverhoo
What a neat feature to add as a feature for C++.

~~~
cperciva
You have to understand the basics. The only thing I can say is I think that
because of this I prefer C++, which is C++.

"Vacation Park: A Biography of The Master"

"It is with deep sadness, I have just reached my final days; for a little while, I thought, there were still people in my life who wanted to know my true thoughts. And I did it with their words. My love was stronger than ever. But when the moment came, it became impossible for me to stay with it."

"The one thing I've done that really helps me to live, though, is to share these experiences with others."

"There's a reason why I've been able to find your voice. As much as I admire you, you're really in no need of my advice. We live in the world's darkest and most dangerous place. And, for that matter, we are in the world's most difficult place—on the planet Earth. The fact of the matter is, I've been told there is a place for all of us on Earth called "The Edge of Hell" that we're in, because we live there. So, while I'm here in my place and I've been listening to these conversations, I thought of you. You've been there, I've been there, too, for so long, that, at this point, I don't know where I'm coming from. But you've been there. And I just have to take some steps to make that world more dangerous—and to make it more beautiful."

"That's really wonderful," she said.

She took the chair across the room, holding it.

"I don't think I can," she said. "I mean, this is really a place I'd like to live in—in, say, the New World. I've got two hundred million of them here in the States. And if I ever had a wife, we'd have two million more here. But I'm sure you guys are not going to leave all these kids and their grandchildren in this place. The Edge of Hell is very, very dangerous. So, while I'm here, I would like to take this opportunity, to give you the greatest of all experiences."

"I'd like to say to you, I think it's possible to live on the planet Earth," she said, not quite able to finish the sentence, "through these experiences. For this sake, for all you are, please go ahead, okay? We will try and be as different as you can be. But until we do that, I hope you'll never leave. Until then, we are on the verge of one final big breakthrough. But before you go to a place like that, I'd really like to say thank you for the life you've given me. And thank you very much, really, for sharing your experience with me. And I'm very, very, very grateful for everything you did for me—and for your happiness, for your strength, for your willingness to get to the bottom of it all, and for everything that has happened since I'm here."

He stood up.

"This is how it was," he said. "And I'm going to make some really good points, you and I, and make it worth your while."

"Okay," she said, but she didn't stop to think.

She was going to make some really good points, too. And she was going to make them good.

"I've got two more here, and we're going to have to talk to the police tomorrow about it."

He pulled the chair closer to hers. "Okay, I'll make it a deal," he said. "Tell the police that you're one of the people that put all this together. You know, like when you're not at home anymore, and you're not even sure it matters. When your husband dies, you put all this together and everything will come back together. And that's how it would be, if I wanted to do this right."

And she did. And she was really, really grateful for his kindness.

And he leaned down to kiss her on the forehead.

And he smiled.

And she took his hands and kissed him again.

And he was gone.

It was as if, he realized, he had only just finished the last chapter.

And he got up and walked toward the door, then stood there, his face blank, staring down at her.

"You're a beautiful person," he said, after the short silence.

She laughed.

And he grinned.

"Yeah," he said. "And you're beautiful, too."

She took the chair again and went to the bathroom, pulling open the curtains. Then she took off her jacket, got into her
