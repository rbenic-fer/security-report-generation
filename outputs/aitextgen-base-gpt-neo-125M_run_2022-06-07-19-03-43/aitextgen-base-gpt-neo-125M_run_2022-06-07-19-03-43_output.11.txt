====================
File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  
'The following module does not exist: '

From the commit "Migration to Microsoft Office 2015", I think you must have  
'configured the application to be launched from the terminal instead. 

There is a lot of options on the Mac or Windows and it seems to work with  
Windows as well. 
You should install these options first.

If you are using Windows, you need to create the project using
:git clone https://github.com/MVIO/VIO_Exploit_Office.git https://github.com/MVIO/VIO_Exploit_Office.git

It is advisable to use the following command in the command-line (you have to specify it as  

> command-line:

> $ git clone https://github.com/MVIO/VIO_Exploit_Office.git

There are other options that you can take into account with this command. If you  
want to install these options then the command to install these  
options would be:  

> $ git install

That is fine, the installation command will install these  
options into the project. 
But in order to use them you need to provide some kind of command  

> command-line:

> command-line:

> $ git install   

That will install them into the project as you normally would. 
You may also want to configure the environment in the environment in the command-line as  
> 
> $ env   

The following environment file is the one that you need to have in your project, so  
you can use this environment file as follows. 

> env   

This is where you can find the environment file.

If you want to change the name to the version you're using to the command, you can do it by using the following command:
ExploitOffice_Version = '20'

But, please note that this command does not actually find the file you're trying to execute. If it does find a file that does not exist, you will need to modify the file you created for this command to get it to work.
The other way to execute the command is by using a file called 'exploit_office_version'. This command is usually used for a "real" command like a report. But you need to give this command the file you are running on to run.

<Gonzo|> bbw
<Myrtti> ok cool, you're going to have to install an upgrade later on.
<Myrtti> so, to test, run'sudo apt install office-upgrade-manager | grep Office-upgrade-manager' in the terminal. It will tell you if Office-upgrade-manager is installed or not and if it's installed it will tell you if it's running on a server.
<Myrtti> but it will tell you that Office-upgrade-manager has upgraded itself. I'm going to install office-upgrade-manager now.
<Myrtti> so we're not doing anything strange
<Gonzo|> I think so.
<Myrtti> you mean you're going to run an upgrade from 0.2.8 to 0.2.9, which it's not going to take.
<Gonzo|> I'll try to take a look though
<Gonzo|> I'm going to get my hands on 0.3.6 for release 1.2.3, which I hope I can find a way to run
<Myrtti> gc
<Myrtti> I'm going to do that now. I want to install 0.3.7 and 0.3.8 and then I want to install 0.3.5. It's already installed on my hard disk...
<Gonzo|> You are welcome to use your time to download 0.3.5, or 0.3.4. If you can, that will give me a little more time. I have no idea how it was installed.
<Gonzo|> I'm going to try and install 0.3.6, and then it's the first time I can install it, and I'll update.
<Gonzo|> It's been a while.
<Gonzo|> It's been a while...
<Gonzo|> I'm just saying that I'm trying to get it working so it can be fixed.
<Gonzo|> It's been a while.
<Myrtti> oh, I see
<Myrtti> if you installed 0.3.5 on your hard drive...
<Gonzo|> OK, cool. I'll do that.
<Gonzo|> That's it.
<Gonzo|> So 0.3.5. I'll have to go.
<Gonzo|> Good luck.
<Gonzo|> I'm not happy about that.
<Gonzo|> My hard drive's broken.
<Gonzo|> The only thing I can do to make it stable is have it automatically update the OS.
<Gonzo|> It doesn't do that at all.
<Gonzo|> OK, so I'll do that.
<Gonzo|> I'll just do 0.3.6 and then have my install.
<Gonzo|> Then I'll get my upgrade.
<Gonzo|> Yeah, so I will.
<Gonzo|> OK, I'll get back to you in a few days.
<Myrtti> Gxz: If you want to do that, you can check your system log from this thread on lilo: http://paste.ubuntu.com/124711/
<Gxz> Myrtti: I'll do that.
<Gxz> Myrtti: It won't be possible to run the upgrade. The installation will take forever.
<Gxz> It's fine to install if you want a quick install. If it isn't possible to install that is, but you should try it yourself.
<Myrtti> gxz: I don't think you can find your system log from this thread.
<Gxz> Myrtti: Yes, you can find the system log.
<Gxz> Myrtti: If I'm mistaken, it shows your system log.
<Gxz> Myrtti: If you want to keep it as stable as possible, you can add an extra line to the line where you say "This is your old install."
<Gxz> Myrtti: That's the way I thought.
<Gxz> Myrtti: So, when you say "The installation is finished," you meant to say, "Now, what do you expect to do after it's installed?"
<Gxz> Myrtti: I don't see any other way to do that.
