To your application, you may need a simple "notification"
(called as 'notification-alert') which shows an alert about the "notification" that was received. 

The notification-alert uses the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Notification
class to indicate a specific alert. This alert is displayed on the notification page by an embedded element and then automatically sent to the server.

If your notification-alert can't handle the "notification" message, a 'alert' is created by sending the notification-alert message as an embedded element, notifying the application.
