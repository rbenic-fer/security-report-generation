Please give me the answer: 
A:

You can use the below formula to get the last digit of the second string
=DBLCOUNT(String.parse(' "ABCDE".txt"","1.00") | String.parse(' "BDEF".txt"") | "BDEFB" )

When I ran the code in the terminal it is showing "Cannot create driver 'videomode-3.5.9-2.0.0' on this machine". What should I do?

A:

You have to add "Driver-C Release" command to the command line to run the driver in the Terminal.
You can add the following line in the terminal:
$ cd videomode-3.5.9-2.0.0
$ sudo./videomode-3.5.9-2.0.0

When running the command like this: 
$ sudo -H /dev/urandom -i 
Cannot create driver 'videomode-3.5.9-2.0.0' on this machine 

Then, if you have added a file to /etc/videomode/videomode.cfg, you will see the same error message.

This is a bit of a duplicate of this article which includes a description of the different ways you can pass the `-o 
options -p `--pipe flag:

You can set the option with 

`--pipe flag -o`

If you want to use this flag, you will need to run this command.

You can also do the same with 

`--pipe --pipe-flag -p`

If you do not want the option to be set to false, you can use 

`--pipe --pipe-flag --pipe-flag -p`

If you want the flag to be set to false, set it to an empty string to prevent this issue.

Example:

```c
set -e "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1

Set the option to false to allow the `--pipe flag` to be set. 

```

Example:

```c
set -e "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1

Set the option to false to allow the option to be set. 

```

```

Example:

```c

set -e "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1

Set the option to false to allow the option to be set. 

```

```

Example:

```c

You could use 
$str = '\b\f'. $row['_']. $row['_3']. $row['_2']. $row['_5'];

In addition, you should always include the whole string in the string, so that the value is in fact a simple char (e.g., "\d\f").

Is there a way to do this in V5? Thanks in advance.

A:

You can use 
pch.create_entry("entry_name", "path", "path1", "path2", "path3")

to create a file path/path2 in the specified directory using the following syntax:
pch.create_entry("entry_name", "path", "path1", "path2", "path3")

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create_entry#Create_entry

A:

You are looking for CreateFile() from http://www.binnavi.com/
CreateFile() is similar to create_entry() but it is a custom method for creating a file.
For example, create_entry() should look like the following:
int main() {
    File path = new File("somepath", "somepath");
    String path2 = "/somepath/1/path1/path2";
    File path = new File("somepath", "somepath");
    // you would normally create a file path using Path1, Path2, or Path3
    //path2.open(path2); 
    String path1 = "/somepath/1/path2";
    File path = new File("somepath", "path1");

    // path would be created in path2, path would be opened in path1 and path would be closed in path2
    Path2 path2 = new Path2("somepath");

    //path would have a path name of "somepath/1/path2"

    Path3 path3 = new Path3();

    Path3 path32 = new Path3();
    File path3 = Path3.create_path("path2");

    //path3 would be created in path3, but not in path2
    //path32.open(path3); 
    String path32 = Path3.create_path("path3");

    //path32 would be created in path3, but not in path2
    //path32.open(path3); 
    File path32 = Path3.create_path("path2");

    //path32 would have a path name of "path3", not in path2,
    //path32.open(path3); 
    Path3 path3 = Path3.create_path("path3");

    //path32 would be opened in path3, but not in path2,
    //path3.open(path3); 
    String path3 = Path3.create_path("path3");

    //path32 would have a path name of "path3", not in path2,
    //path3.open(path3); 
    Path3 path32 = Path3.create_path("path3");

    return 0;
}

You might try using File.openPath() to open a file and the path and its contents are stored there.
