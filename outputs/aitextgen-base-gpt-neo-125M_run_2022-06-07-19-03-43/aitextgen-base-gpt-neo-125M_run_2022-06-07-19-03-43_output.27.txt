Log analysis on 

How do I determine if the test set is correct?

A:

There is no single way of comparing a test to a reference set, just a reference to the test set.
However, your reference method (from the test set) is a bit different. The reference is for the test and is used to generate a test set.
You could try to have a reference method like this (the reference to the test):
def check_reference():
    t1 = TestSet(TestSet().ref()).test()
    t2 = TestSet(TestSet().ref()).test()
    return t1 == t2.get_equal_to_reference(test_name)

This will get you started with using the reference to your test set

3. RESULTS {#sec3-pharmaceutics-11-00180}
==========

3.1. Characteristics of the Study Population {#sec3dot1-pharmaceutics-11-00180}
-------------------------------------------

Overall, a total of 482 patients (median age, 56 years; range, 38--75 years; SD, 15.9, 5.4) were enrolled. The majority of the participants were men (83.9%) and females (82.5%). The average weight of each patient was 178.2 ± 13.3 kg (SD, 10.1, 11.2).

[Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-11-00180-f001){ref-type="fig"} shows the clinical characteristics of the study population, along with the distribution of variables in each group. The main parameters, including the body mass index (BMI), the body weight, the weight-for-height (BH) ratio, the weight-for-height circumference (W/H), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), showed higher levels of education (16.1% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.008), smoking (P = 0.012), and daily energy intake (P = 0.001), while the BMI was lower (P = 0.001) in the lower education group. The average number of alcohol consumption (3.7%) was higher in the lower education group (4.4%) and vice versa in the higher education group (P = 0.04). The proportion of patients with overweight (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2^) was higher (P = 0.016) in the lower education group than in the higher education group. The patients who had no alcohol use (21.7%) and no smoking (17.1%) were more likely to have a low education level, while patients who had smoked (9.8%) or had no alcohol use (7.6%) were more likely to have a low education level and to have low consumption of alcohol.

3.2. Physical Activity {#sec3dot2-pharmaceutics-11-00180}
---------------------

The average daily physical activity for each participant was 14.9 ± 3.4 min/week (SD, 6.1, 3.6), which was higher than the average daily physical activity of healthy adults (13.7 ± 4.7 min/week (SD, 6.0, 3.6)) and patients with a high BMI (P = 0.003). The mean physical activity for the patients with low education and no alcohol use was lower than the values of healthy adults (6.9 ± 2.5 min/week and 8.0 ± 3.2 min/week, respectively) and patients with high education (10.9 ± 4.2 min/week and 8.5 ± 4.3 min/week, respectively). The proportion of patients with moderate to heavy burden (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2^) was lower in the lower education group (16.4% vs. 20.9%, P = 0.007), while the proportion of patients with moderate to heavy burden (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2^) was higher in the lower education group (14.2% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.010).

The total number of drinks taken per day per day was 3.6 ± 1.3 (SD, 1.7, 3.6) in the low education group, and 1.8 ± 0.9 (SD, 1.2, 1.3) in the high education group. The mean drink-over-dinner consumption per day was 2.4 ± 0.9 in the low education group, and 3.3 ± 1.6 (SD, 2.5, 4.7) in the high education group. The percentage of drinks consumed by the total number of drinks was higher in the lower education group (2.6 ± 0.9) than in the high education group (2.3 ± 0.8) (P = 0.03). The consumption of alcohol was higher in the low education group than in the high education group. The proportion of the drink-over-dinner drink-drinks per day was higher in the low education group than in the high education group (14.8 ± 3.3 vs. 8.5 ± 2.4, respectively).

The final results are shown in [**\[1.0\]**]{}. For comparison, [**\[2.0\]**]{} have also been presented in [**\[1.1\]**]{} where $\Xi$ is the constant of integration. For example, for $\Xi=0$ one sees that [**\[1.2\]**]{} is a constant. In this case the factorization has been used as in the paper, but its value is less clear (see [**\[3\]**]{}) because of the way the function has been derived from its expression (\[1.2\]). The factorization of the two-photon correlation function in a two-body system was done in [@Fon0], while [**\[4\]**]{} was done in [@Fon1]. One should note that, as in [**\[1.1\]**]{}, [**\[2.0\]**]{} was given as a result of its calculation, but it was shown to be incorrect, but not proven.

[**The results on the time evolution of $R(t,\Delta t,\mu)$ in the case of two particles**]{}. In the case of two particles one may expect a simple function, for which the factorization takes place. For simplicity one has $\Delta
t=\Delta x$, $\Delta t=\Delta x+\Delta x/2$, and $\Delta x=\Delta x+\Delta x/2$. It is obvious that, for $t\ne 0$ and $\Delta
x=\Delta x$, one needs $R(t,\Delta t,\mu)=R(0,\Delta t,\mu)$. However, in this case the factorization takes place because the initial-state is not a part of the initial-state distribution, and its contribution will be due to a non-interacting part. In this case one should take into account the fact that for any interaction between the two particles, its value must be smaller than some characteristic value. It is evident that in the case of two particles the final state is not a part of the initial-state distribution. In order to make a conclusion about the contribution from the time evolution of $R(t,\Delta t,\mu)$ in the case of two particles, it is necessary to calculate the contribution to $R(t,\Delta t,\mu)$ from the final state at a certain time step and to take into account the effect on the time evolution of the initial-state distribution $G(\mu)$. As shown in [**\[5\]**]{} in [**\[6\]**]{}, the expression (\[2.4\]) is also wrong.

[**The result of the time evolution of $R(t,\Delta t,\mu)$ in the case of a two-particle system**]{}. In this case we have $\Delta t\le 0$ and $\mu\le
\Delta x$ so that $\Gamma(0)\rightarrow \Gamma(0)/\Gamma(1)=\Gamma(\pi/2,0)$, $e^{-\Gamma(\pi/2,0)/2}$ being the effective probability distribution. It is shown that, for $\Delta x=\Delta x/2$ the expression (\[2.2\]) is correct. As a result of this calculation it can be seen that [**\[5\]**]{} is wrong and it cannot be used as a result of any change in the value of $\Gamma$. In order to have a conclusion about the contribution from the time evolution of $R(t,\Delta t,\mu)$ in the case of two particles one should take into account the effect of $\Delta t=\Delta x$. From the factorization formula one can easily deduce that $R(t,\Delta t,\mu)=G(\mu)-\Gamma(\mu
