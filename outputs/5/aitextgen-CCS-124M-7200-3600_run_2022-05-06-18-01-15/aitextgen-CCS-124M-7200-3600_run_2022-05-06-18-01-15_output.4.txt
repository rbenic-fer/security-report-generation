Before it is used as the subject’s computer. These backups can assist in building
a time line of evidence and can also be used to gain access to a passcode locked device. It is good practice to not only
the device on the device, but also the device’s memory chip from the memory board.
Another, less destructive modification that can be performed to some mobile devices is the process
known as “Rooting” or “Jail Breaking” the device. This process involves leveraging features of the
operating system to elevate the permissions of the user (similar to the process of gaining
“Root” access in a Linux computer). This process involves the modification of system files and can
potentially damage the device and so should be low on the list of techniques leveraged.
The order of attempted extractions is important. Examiners should strive to conduct the
examination method that is least destructive with the most yield first. This allows examiners to
capture areas that might be damaged or overwritten at later stages. Methods of extraction such as
JTAG and Chip-Off should only be considered as a last resort as, especially with Chip-Off, the
process can be destructive and un-recoverable.
3.2.7 Forensic imaging formats
Due to the requirement to use dedicated tools to extract data, mobile phone data is often extracted
in a proprietary format. These formats can often be transfer between different tools to leverage the
strengths of different decoding abilities. Other non-proprietary formats include bin files and raw
files.

Digital Forensics Guide

Another source of forensic evidence is a backup. Some users and devices will create backups of
themselves on other devices, such as the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connectionalgorithm device. This backups can assist in building
a time line of evidence which can also be used to gain access to a passcode locked device. It is also
possible to analyse some backups as if the backups were a physical device. Allowing examiners to
review data stored on a unusably damaged device or a device that cannot be accessed.
3.2.8 Verification / Hashing
Once the data has been extracted, this extracted data should be manually verified on the device.
This will require the forensic examiner checking that the data that has been extracted by the
forensic solution matches what is displayed on the device, such as the correct time/date
information. This will identify any errors with the extracted data or if data is missing as often not
all chat messages, such as Facebook Messenger chat threads, are extracted from the device. If
there are any discrepancies then further extractions can be undertaken to try and acquire the
missing or inaccurate data or a manual examination can be undertaken to manually record the
data. Some additional data (like IMEI and application settings) are often best confirmed / acquired
during this stage.
Once all the required data has been acquired from the device in an acceptable fashion, then the
reports containing the desired data can be compiled and produced for the officer to review.
Prosecutor's considerations
Since the ultimate goal of a digital forensics process is to produce evidence to prove or
disprove disputed facts, electronic evidence must be obtained in compliance with existing
legislation and best practices to ensure admissibility at trials.
Compliance with the existing legal framework on cybercrime is of paramount importance
and it does not include only well-known laws, acts, bills and regulations concerning
criminal justice. It also includes other areas of legislation which, at a first glance, do not
have much in common with criminal law. It is strong
drive of the state of their criminal law framework, who will
challenge most, if not all, aspects of the expert examination. This kind of situation is
becoming more and more frequent in courtrooms and forensic experts must be prepared
for this.
Alternative presentation methods are depending on the technical facilities of the court but
not only there. Plea bargaining and, in some countries, the growing popularity of
“The prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
court and prosecution rooms are not equipped with hardware to support complex
presentations. Expert must be prepared to submit written reports when answer mobile devices, researching
of the mobile devices under the wrong conditions, or information
( possibilities – such as this is a legal
in some jurisdictions)

File Timings Explained
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when stamps are Modified, Accessed or Created
(called MAC times). Some like many UNIX flavours (inc Linux) apply stamps
time stamps on all activity (unless prohibited by the tool accessing the file).
Microsoft Windows however, will stamp full time and date information on

creation and modification but only date information on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, access it on the 2nd Nov, modify it on the 3rd Nov and copy it
onto separate media on the 4th; when the MACs are viewed on the 5th
however, it will appear to have been accessed and modified before it was
created.

As will be explained in the next section, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained the MAC times of the original carried files. Thus
when the carried files are exported from the carrier file a new instance is
written to the new media and although this will have been accessed on the new Forensic
devices are
different as time goes by
259198 and through web mail accessed through the internet browser. On some
devices, the new MAC times can be set to the new
date and time zone correctly.

The only points that jump out from the above list are that the investigator hopes the
user didn’t use the system for online banking with Lloydstsb as several of the
Spyware and Trojans installed were capable of keystroke logging. And it is a

Recruitment should start as soon as the business case has been accepted and the premises are
identified. Having key staff on hand to assist with the identification and selection of hardware and
software would be beneficial. It is vital to note that some digital forensics analysts have a majority of cases where not a single
s of the evidence can be a significant amount of evidential.
Digital forensics analyst – computers
The analysts will require technical knowledge, and where possible appropriate qualifications. Ideally
they should have some training in the use of digital forensic software. Alternately these staff
members will require specific forensic training to bring them to the skill of the forensic analysts to-date and verify the copy
of the digital forensic laboratory.
The forensic analysts must have knowledge to be aware of the quality of the image and the copy of the image.
 They should have some training in the use of digital forensic software. Alternately these staff
members will require specific forensic training to bring them to the job of building the capacity to use the capacity to deliver reliable evidence in a court. Consideration may be
given to issuing each staff member with a Personal Development Portfolio (PDP), which will contain
an ongoing record of their training and qualifications, as well as milestones achieved in their work
place mentored activities.

Managers may use PDP’s to set targets for individuals that will

collectively within the team create a more balanced and effective capacity.
Advancements in technology are moving at a very fast pace and digital forensics analysts need to be regularly trained and retrained to keep
themselves forward for counseling, scalable and points learnt
to prove criminal action. They will also need to set aside some time for these analysts to undertake research and
development. As new tools and applications come onto the market – the analysts should evaluate
them to identify artifacts of value to the digital forensic laboratory.
Staff retention will be key to managing a successful digital forensic laboratory. A great deal of time
and money will be spent on training of staff, and it is vital they are retained, especially once they
are trained and begin to become more experienced. Having robust personal development plans for
each member of staff will give them objectives and a better understanding of their career path and
future opportunities. It must always be remembered that retaining staff is not simply a matter of
salary.

evidential results in order to understand and verify their actions and
findies. It is good practice to introduce responsible methods of prioritising workload for individuals that have
 capacity to use the capacity to carry out the function of the court but
not only there. Plea bargaining and, in some countries, the growing popularity of
“Theerred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
court and prosecution rooms are not equipped with hardware to support complex
presentations. Expert must be prepared to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. Situations like this should be anticipated by the forensic laboratory
and certified mobile equipment for such presentations can be a useful option.
In conclusion, the presentation stage should be a goal and outcome of all efforts of the
forensic laboratory, examiners and support staff, and should always be on the mind of
the personnel involved. The facts and evidence will serve the task for establishing the
material or substantive truth, depending on the legal system. Thez will be used for the
adjudication of the criminal case, for justice and for the compensation of victims.
The role and responsibility of digital forensic examiners are thus crucial for criminal
justice.
