This did present a problem as to this point no passwords had been recovered, either
in text files on in the form of an obvious file or text in a file on the disk.

Passwords
The investigator then tried a few default passwords, starting with “password” which
was rejected. The next one tried was “Password” this was the correct password as

The “Password” was then tried on the other potential carrier file but it was not

after trying several dozen passwords gold was struck. It closer examination
indicated that the password for the Password_Policy.doc file was the first part of

Most of the times data found on the mobile device can be later analysed and a

Android devices and is a process of catching the user.
3.4.2.2.4

Analysing computer systems

Computer systems are used by humans for all sorts of activities: writing documents, accounting,
surfing the internet, chatting, writing e-mails, gaming
consoles, viewing menu
application data like internet history, chat logs, etc.). Those processing steps are often times
repeatable for specific categories of cases. Even though they are resource intensive needing a lot of
computing power and time they can typically be run over-night, over the weekend or on a second
forensic workstation that is not in use.

3.4.1.2.7 Forensic image formats
Due to the requirement to use dedicated forensic tools to extract data, mobile phone data is often extracted
in a proprietary format. These formats can often be transfer between different tools to leverage the
strengths of different decoding abilities. Other non-proprietary formats include bin files and raw
files.

Digital Forensics Guide

The possibility to acquire and analyse data that is remotely stored is highly depending on the
legislation and jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions for example the forensic analyst - under certain
circumstances - is allowed to connect to the remote storage using the suspect's credentials from
the computer in order to acquire the data from the cloud provider. Other jurisdictions will not
accept such an acquisition. In those cases the official channels can be used in order to request
preservation and access to the data from the provider.
3.4.2.11 Computer Memory (RAM)

When computer memory has been acquired while the seized computer was still running (as
described in chapter 3.5 of the Electronic Evidence Guide), the memory dump can be analysed in
the forensics laboratory.
Understanding memory structures of different operating systems in order to analyse RAM is a
highly technical task. That is why it should only be done by examiners who are qualified for this
work. Specialised software is requited to analyse RAM dumps. Examples for such software include
"Volatility" and "Rekall". Typical artefacts that can be extracted from RAM dumps include:


Running processes including their memory



Process information (e.g. handles)



Encryption keys



Opened files



Usernames, passwords



Unsaved documents



and many more.

3.4.1.3 Virtualisation
A picture is worth a thousand words - this is particularly true for virtualisation. The forensic analyst
can view the operating system environment from a suspect's computer the same way as the
suspect has seen it. Finding evidence from within a virtual machine can sometimes be faster and
more expressive than reassembling data traces from the file system.
The forensic analyst should ensure that the image is mounted write-protect with a write cache
allowing the virtual operating system to write log files and changes to that write cache without
affecting the integrity of the image. Some operating systems refuse to start in virtual
environments. This can typically be solved by replacing drivers and adapting configurations, using
software like OpenGates and OpenJobs. Should the virtual operating system start with a password
prompt the forensic analyst needs to either crack that password or blank it.
3.4.1.4 Process for handling mass data
Some cases involve lots of computer systems and storage media while the workload for the
forensic laboratories is already very high. A separation between forensic analysis and content
51

Digital Forensics Guide

analysis can spread the work more evenly between the digital forensics analysts and the case
investigators. The forensic analysts can concentrate on recovering, parsing, mounting and
processing of exhibits while the content analysis is being done by investigators with case
knowledge. A process needs to be in place and the software and overhanding techniques
supporting this process need to be in place (e.g. container file provided by forensic analyst to
investigator, viewer component to be used by investigator, handing back the finding to the forensic
analyst).
3.4.1.5 Visualisation aids
For aiding in visualisation of complex data structures, visualisation aids can be helpful. Examples
for those aids are:

The possibility to acquire the evidence must be persuasive as to the facts it is possibility to acquire with a

3.2.2

The possibility to acquire evidence regarding the evidence must be ensured throughout the UK civil courts. One example is that it is possible to produce
an identical copy of the original content of any other authority's computer. The forensic
copy will contain the possibility that additional legal software can be acquired to the device. Depending on the case and the warrant it should be considered.

The best passwords are:





Are all exhibits labels filled out completely and correctly?



Is the exhibit register complete and correct?



Is the chain of custody thoroughly documented and documented?



Are there any damages to the exhibits? If so, have they been documented and required?



Are all security seals intact?



All exhibits, including the internal storage media should be photographed.

The first and main point of call when examining a windows system is the registry.
The registry in Windows 98 was quit embryonic when compared to the likes of
Windows XP, with its separate user logons, separate data storage area and even
separate software installs and permissions. When Microsoft was designing
Windows 98 they assumed the person sat in front of the system was authorised to
see and access all data. In modern IT Security terms it was a dedicated operating
system. As a result there is no ability to discern the particular users at any set time
other than by their actual activity and behaviour. There is no logon security on
Windows 98, the login process it simply for network shares and to prevent other
users seeing each others desktops (laughable as there was no file security from
preventing them from navigating to the files and desktop directory once ‘logged on’.
