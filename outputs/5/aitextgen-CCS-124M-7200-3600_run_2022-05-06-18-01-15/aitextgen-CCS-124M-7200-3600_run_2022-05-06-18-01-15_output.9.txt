Fortunately the Camouflage program stores the original MAC times from the image below.

Ballard Ind.) were copied onto the Floppy disk [believed to be 26 Apr 2004 @

As Mr RJ Leszczynski, went to leave the building at the end of the day day day he
was stopped and the disk impounded. As the disk is logically labelled with
his initials and he was in possession of it when stopped, it is suggested that
Mr RJ Leszczynski was exporting information that he had access to, to
outside the boundary of Ballard Ind. However, analysis of his work pc would
reveal more information about his activities, and it is recommended that this
is undertaken before it is used/switched on again.

The question as to whether the use conducted any illegal activity can be a difficult
one to answer as it can depend on many things. The pornography for example is
explicit but as to its breach of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 & 64 (OPA) the
investigator turned to the Internet Watch Foundation <www.ifw.org.uk> for advice.
On their site the OPA is defined as:

Software – It is important to consider that there is not only the initial purchase of purchase but also the
ongoing cost of licensing, support and training, associated with most types of digital forensic
software. The initial and ongoing cost of licenses can be significant and research should be
undertaken before purchase to ensure the hardware and software being obtained correctly matches
the laboratories requirements and the staff’s preference. Appendix A shows an exemplary matrix
that shows how a lab manager can create a comparison between different forensic software
products taking into account the functionality as well as the cost of purchase, license renewal and
training.
It is worthy of note that some digital forensics analysts can conduct entire investigations with the
use of open source or free software – however there is a lack of support and training opportunities
with these types of product. Many jurisdictions and standards will require ‘dual tool verification’ and
additional software may need to be purchased in order for the analysts to compare and verify their
findings.
A fundamental requirement for the smooth running of any laboratory is some type of case
management system. This is a database that holds all the relevant administration information
about the evidence and cases held at the laboratory and will be fundamental to the integrity of the
analysts’ processes.
The minimum entries for a case management system should be as follows:


Date, time and person delivering and receiving the exhibit to the laboratory.



Unique reference number – software generated.



Case number or crime number.



Exhibit reference numbers.



OIC/ investigating officer/prosecutor name and contact details.



Type of crime.



All laboratory staff that have contact with the exhibits.



The points to prove or what is required from the investigation.



Time factors – such as delivery dates and anticipated court dates.



Date imaged – who by and details of the items imaged.

Digital Forensics Guide



Verification hash results.



Date investigation commenced.



Assigned forensic officers and staff involved in the investigation.



Details of quality assurance by colleagues and managers.



Date investigation completed.



Record of communication with the officer in charge of the submission.



Record of communication with the officer in charge of the submission.



Record of communication with the officer in charge of the submission.



Date and time exhibits/report were collected.

All this information is vitally vitally important to show continuity, credibility and verification of actions and
evidence. A software database should be created by a technically proficient person unless the
forensic laboratory utilises on of the commercial software packages that are available.

2.5.3

Quality assurance/ review procedure

As with all types of evidence it is possible that digital findings will be questioned once they are
presented to a court of law. Due to the volatile nature of electronic evidence it is imperative that
steps are taken to ensure the integrity of the evidence and the validity of the findings.
It is very important that procedures to monitor the quality of the work undertaken by the
laboratory are established and implemented from the outset. All staff and managers must be fully
conversant with their role in quality assurance and should adhere to the procedures on all cases.
Random QA checks, peer reviews and administrative reviews should be carried out in good time for any case.
Managers should consider the introduction of recognised, externally audited, standards to maintain
quality, information security and validation of forensic techniques. These standards are described in
ISO 9001 – Quality Management, ISO 27001 – Information Security and ISO 17025 - Laboratory
Validation. It is sensible to introduce responsible methods of prioritising workload from the beginning.

Expert witness status

The witness, professional witness and judicial, must be
aware not only of the applicable criminal law framework, but his/her appearance and overall impression as well.
Of course, proportionality is expected. Any unauthorised intrusion or coercive measure
will most probably occur. Use a Windows program such as Notepad instead.
