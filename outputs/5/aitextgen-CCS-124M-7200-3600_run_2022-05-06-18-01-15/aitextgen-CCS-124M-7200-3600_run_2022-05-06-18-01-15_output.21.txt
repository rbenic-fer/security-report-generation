Creating a File Activity Timeline

Next a file timeline was created from all Allocated and Unallocated space on the
drive including the Unallocated Data structures. This would show the order in
which files were created, modified and deleted. The file was created by Autopsy
and as the ‘output/body’ file was created an md5 hash of the file was also written to
the working folder (/forensics/floppy/FloppyDisk/). The final step for this
item was to create the time-line file from the body with a start and end point. As
Floppy disk contained small amounts of data a complete timeline was requested
and this was saved as ‘output/total-timeline’.

The timeline would be later analysed and referred to as a key reference document,
indicating file activity and user actions. As the timeline related to a floppy disk the
activity recorded would primarily be that of the user as systems are rarely able to
page or record system activity to the media (limited volume size, slow read and
write speed coupled with a lack of system pre-notification as to its removal)

Although the names of the relation to a floppy disk the root consisted of 5 directories in the root
listed above delineate five separate dates of video recordings which are
authentic, the aim is to
produce the best possible copy, copy, or image, of all files. These backups can assist in building
a time line of evidence and can also be used to gain access to a passcode locked device. It is good practice to not only have one backup but also another off-site backup.
While the digital forensic analyst is conducting the analysis with his working copy of the image
there should still be a backup stored on another system (e.g. an imaging server).

3.2.2

Acquisition of computer systems

In order to acquire the image, a forensic image was
a.
The possibility to acquire the original image was a physical copy of the original content of any digital storage seized. Working on the duplicate (never
the original) they can apply smart, case-specific filters (data mining) (data mining) or they can just process the
image (e.g. by recovering deleted files, mounting containers, breaking encryption, parsing
application data like internet history, chat logs, etc.). Those processing steps are often times
repeatable for specific categories of cases. Even though they are resource intensive needing a lot of
computing power and time they can typically be run over-night, over the weekend or on a second
forensic workstation that is not in use.

3.3.1

Processing of computer systems

Not only the number of computer systems per household and organisations, but also the amount of
storage in these computer systems is rising. Managing large amount of data while keeping the
backlog short is a big challenge for digital forensics laboratories. That is why different processing
approaching should be considered.
3.3.1.1 Case-specific considerations
Before analysing a case it is important to ask the case officer what type of data is needed for this
case. The information provided should include a scope of which data are relevant and which data
can be filtered out. Based on that information the analyst can consider which processing options
might be applicable. Depending on the case and the warrant it should also be considered which
data might be applicable to analyse different artifacts unique to different types of case. Files can
be filtered by signature analysis, by size, by date, by owner, etc.

3.3.2

Processing of computer systems

As with the processing of computer exhibits, the number and storage capacity of mobile phones per
household is increasing. Along with this increase, the added functionality and reliance on mobile
devices leads to a wealth of data available for forensic analysis. Examples of this data are locations
and communication logs.
3.3.2.2 Automated processing
The processing of mobile devices often requires a different approach to computers due to the wildly
varying hardware and software used between devices. Applications are updated with a much
greater frequency and changes can often be major. For this reason, dedicated forensic tools will

Although the names of the pornography video files did include on several occasions
the words rape, the belief is that many are either ‘staged’ or simply advertising tricks
to increase hits. Note – this was a
common renaming trick used by site owners to increase the size of their libraries
and to maintain customer interest. Detailed analysis of these files was not
performed.
There were also 30 music files and music videos, mainly of Elvis. They type and
quality of these indicates they were originally released by one of the major recording

With online music purchasing increasing exponentially in the UK, the user may
have an external device or other system where they legally acquire the files.
However, it is the belief of given the other files in these folders
(ie pornography) which are unlikely to be ‘purchased’ these music videos were also
downloaded via the peer-to-peer software especially as there were 4 different types

While a streamlined approach is followed to a data recovery process, priorisation
would still allow analysis of all exhibits.
3.3.1.5 Data recovery
Recruitment should be essential if no evidential files have been found in the allocated
areas of the disk. Data recovery is possible on different levels. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a disk are shown in the forensic software or if there are any
notable partition gaps. Those gaps should be scanned for additional partitions. The next step is to
undelete files and folders from a file system. After that, additional files can be recovered by
scanning the unallocated areas for known file headers and footers (carving).
3.3.1.6 Filtering techniques
Applying filters to an image before it is being analysed can help to reduce the amount of data that
the forensic analyst has to view and analyses. Popular filtering techniques are using hash sets to help identify subjects for investigation. The first
hash calculation should be done at the beginning of the analyst in the beginning of the image. The second hash calculation should be done at the end of the
imaging process. This second calculation should be done on both the original medium as well as the
copy/image in order to prove that a) the data on the original medium has not changed during the
imaging process and b) the data on the copy/image is exactly the same.
3.3.1.5 Data recovery
Recruitment should be possible to miss evidential data file types. Files can
be filtered by signature analysis, by size, by date, by owner, etc.

necessary. A number of available tools use a form of “fuzzy processing”, that is to say the

Filtering of mobile data is typically performed on a data type level. Data is filtered by tools during
processing into groups such as communication data and media files. These groups are then further
divided; for example communication data can be divided into call records and messages. The level
of filtering presented to the analyst depends on the tool being used, however this filtering allows
