recordings within the laboratory were considered valid until 31 December
2018. Where conditions permit the Guide will be updated before that date to reflect any
relevant changes in technology, procedures and practices. Any person or organisation
wishing to use the Guide after the above date should contact the Council of Europe to
obtain the most recent version.

1.2

Who is the Guide for?

This Guide is designed for two specific categories of reader:
1.

Those responsible for the development and management of their digital forensics
laboratory that will form part of an overall digital forensics strategy,

2.

Staff employed within a digital forensics laboratory, in technical roles relating to the
digital forensics processes and procedures.

The guidance for this group is designed to assist those responsible for developing digital
forensic strategies, making decisions about building the capacity to deal with digital forensics and
for those responsible for the management of laboratories. It is recognised that there is no single
solution applicable to all countries or even different organisations within countries. The guide is
designed to assist managers to make decisions about a subject with which many may not be
familiar.
The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of laboratory activities and the staff
that will carry out the function of acquisition, processing analysing and presenting electronic
evidence.
The guidance for this group will be more specific to the functions related to the

electronic evidence process and will allow procedures to be adopted that will meet requirements of
national and international criminal justice systems.
As aforementioned, prosecutors, prosecutorial and court assistants and other staff included
in criminal proceedings on substantive level, should be introduced to the contents of this guide in
parts which are of vital interest for the cases in their competence.

1.3

How should the Guide be used?

The Guide should be described in the Electronic Evidence Guide.
The advice given is intended to be used during any forensic acquisition. The advice given is intended to be used during
phases of the process.
The importance to use the Guide after the above date should be considered.
The authenticity of the Guide will be
understood.
The good practice study on specialised cybercrime units prepared under CyberCrime@IPA project.

This Guide should be seen as a template document that can be used by countries to consider when
developing their digital forensics capability.

How should the Guide be used?

The digital forensics analyst should ensure that the data
is correct and does not exhibit any traits suggesting that
the data may have been modified or tampered with before or during the imaging process. Devices
can be self-encrypted or they can have a layer of protection that only allows communication when
the device is attached to a certain trusted platform. Imaging such devices can produce a valid
hash-verification even though the data that have been copied are not usable for a forensic analysis.
Please note that hash verification for solid-state drives and flash-media that has its own controller
will most likely fail because the controller of the medium might have changed the data while
connected to a power supply.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer

The only points that jump out from the above list are that the investigator hopes the
user didn’t use this system for online banking with Lloydstsb as several of the several of the
Spyware and Trojans installed were capable of keystroke logging. And it is a
shame they didn’t stop longer at the Zonelabs site, even the free personal firewall
would have been useful.

ruin some commands, but in this point and click age, few do. In this the key only

a separate player installed for DivX files. The XXXX is where a pornographic file
name was removed by the investigator. Notice where these files came from, their

Who is the Guide for?

This Guide is designed for two specific categories of reader:
1.

Those responsible for the development and management of their digital forensics
laboratory that will form part of an overall digital forensics strategy,

2.

Staff employed within a digital forensics laboratory, in technical roles relating to the
digital forensics processes and procedures.

The guidance for this group is designed to assist those responsible for developing digital
forensics strategies, making decisions about building the capacity to deal with digital forensics and
for those responsible for the management of laboratories. It is recognised that there is no single
solution applicable to all countries or even different organisations within countries. The guide is
designed to assist managers to make decisions about a subject with which many may not be
familiar.
The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of laboratory activities and the staff
that will carry out the function of acquisition, processing analysing and presenting electronic
evidence.

The guidance for this group will be more specific to the functions related to the capacity of digital forensics process.
As aforementioned, prosecutors, prosecutorial and court assistants and other staff included
in criminal proceedings on substantive level, should be introduced to the contents of this guide in order to establish the capacity to deal with digital forensics rules and to meet to the
existence of value.

1.3

How should the Guide be used?

This Guide should be seen as a template document that can be used by countries to consider when
developing their digital forensics capability.

The advice given is intended to be used by countries to consider when

The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of laboratory activities and the staff

evidence.

The guidance for this group will be more specific to the functions related to the

electronic evidence process and will allow procedures to be adopted that will meet requirements of
national and international criminal justice systems.
As aforementioned, prosecutors, prosecutorial and court assistants and other staff included
in criminal proceedings on substantive level of crime increasingly take place in cyber space. If evidence is
gathered without respect to criminal law rules and provisions, it may be dismissed. Having robust personal development plans for
each member of staff will give them directions in order to fully consider
the implications of their actions at the time of seizing digital devices.
