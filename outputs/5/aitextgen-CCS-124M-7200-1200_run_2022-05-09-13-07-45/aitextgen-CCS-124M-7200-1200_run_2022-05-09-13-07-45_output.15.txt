To prepare a new machine could be created by a new member of staff. They
must have a set of instructions in the future of their digital forensics
laboratory that will allow them to create their own
reports and to cross-check their performance.
Ideally, it is the assumption of the investigator that the user gives up on 22 August 2004,
believing the disk to be corrupt elects to scrap the system some time over
17
 2004.

In the next section, if the current user log in is not familiar with the older user of

Summary of events and supposition by the investigator

The following is the summary of the events; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
stemmed from

Acquisition

The first file modified file modified file was created by Autopsy (unless otherwise stated). The
missing file contained (i) a total of ten (10) videos
with audio recorded on two (2) separate devices, and (3) reviewing the settings of the video recording device. The raw video shows that the video files were
authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or editing. This conclusion is supported by the consistency of the video
file date and time stamps, the video timecode, as well as the folder and file naming scheme. The uniformity between the
footage from the cameras from the two Investigators also support the evidence that the video files created by the video recording device
device, otherwise created images of the same events within the same duration
as captured from the two separate video recorders’ hands.

Evidence Acquisition Processing Procedures
Coalfire’s analysis of the video-only shows that the video files were
 edited manually and the video files were not solely advertising tricks
to increase hits.

As will be explained in the next section, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained its floppy disk properties despite being imaged. Thus
when the carried files are exported from the carrier file a new instance is
written to the new media and although this will have a different creation time
again, it will retain the original accessed and modification times.

What Happened (Investigators Opinion)

Having examined the data obtained from various sources and parts of the disk, the
following is offered as a possible explanation of what has been found:

Before 23 April 2004, a Mr Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was employed
by Ballard Industries as the lead process control engineer for the project to
design a new fuel cell battery. Mr RJ Leszczynski, it is believed, brought a

This program may have been brought in file by file to prevent detection, as
the CamShell.dll file had deleted been on floppy disk until it was deleted.
The program was probably installed on a Ballard Ind. PC and this could be
confirmed by scanning all systems to which Leszczynski would have had
access, looking for the CamShell.dll file or remnants of it having been there.
