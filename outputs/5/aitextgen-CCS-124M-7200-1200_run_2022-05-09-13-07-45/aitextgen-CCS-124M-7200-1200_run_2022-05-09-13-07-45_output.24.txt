Included in the Full Footage videos released by the Center for Medical Progress on YouTube, the following video recording was captured from the video recording device’s
briefcase, but this is currently a subject of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.
The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis submitted based on the authenticity of the
Work for Hire Document did not cover or include:
-

Validation of those individuals depicted in the video or audio, who recorded the video files, the
location where they were recorded, when they were recorded, or the purpose of the
 video.

The video files contained (i) a total of ten (10) videos
with audio recorded on two (2) separate devices, with lumbar support and height adjustment. The video
recording of the video files contained on the flash drive indicates that the video files were
authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or editing.
There were any discrepancies on the authenticity of the video files that described
in this report.
The video files does not contain any metadata or particularly unique to the user. It is
art of the that the video files were created by the video recording device and did not include on the flash drive.
The metadata embedded in the video file upon the flash drive indicates that the video files were
to design and modified manually.
The video files residing on the flash drive indicates that the video files were
to the video recording device and were not able to be used to create their own video files. The video
matched the video files does not show any exact copies of the video file on the flash drive.
The metadata embedded in the video file names are not consistent with the intentional removal of this non-pertinent footage as described in the video file
following.
The metadata embedded in the video file names are not consistent with the numeric dates of the video
in the video file names.

Video Content Analysis and Comparison of computer evidence
Although the following will require a large desk for IT equipment, there are several
different types of ‘avoidable’ traces automatically stored on the flash drive
in this way (as shown in the table below). However, they can be prevented by someone who knows
what they are searching for.
Unavoidable traces: By contrast, unavoidable traces are, of course, those that cannot be disabled
or those that require considerable effort to stop temporarily. The probability of finding such traces
is correspondingly high even if a suspect has tried to cover his or any
Company, or an assertion of certainty.

Summary of events and supposition by the investigator

©

The following is the summary of the events; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
stemmed from the lack of basic internet security devices ie a Firewall and AntiVirus
(although from this investigation not even Norton could have helped him). The user
elected to install several ‘free’ internet accelerators and dubious software touting to
be popup stoppers etc.
The installation of several peer-to-peer program facilitated the increase in

downloaded software of dubious sources and the volume of pornography installed
on the system hints to broadband being installed – there is a reference to NTL
broadband medic in the unallocated space but much of this data is corrupt. The
user seems to have become aware of the Spyware as a popup blocker is installed
and a few weeks later the installation of Spyware-blocker is seemingly started,
however possibly due to so many files being infected and corrupted or hardware
failure, the system crashed during the install and despite attempts over several days
the system is never again operational.

It was noted that the user had considered purchasing a new machine as several
references to Dell <www.dell.co.uk> were seen in the cache and the Internet
Explorer history points to the commencement or at least pricing of a Dell
Dimension 2400.

When the system finally fails to boot on 22 August 2004 the user makes the
decision to dispose of it. They remove the memory and, judging by the software
and media players installed (one from X-Men2 and Nero Burning Burning Burning ROM), a
DVDR/CDRW 51/2” device (see the images at the start). Then either believing that
no data can be recovered or not knowing about data forensics, the case is then
dumped at the local refuse facility, where the investigator spots it the next day.

During the second phase of this practical the Ceglia Media Player was examined to
according to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia Media “to
identify only documents, data, fragments, and artifacts that reasonably appear[ed] to
be related to the authenticity of the [Work for Hire] attached to the
Amended Complaint and the [P]urported [E]mails described in the Amended
Complaint.”. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Stroz Friedberg
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg has followed the terms of the Protocol for all data found on the Ceglia
Media and any other data subject to the Protocol during its analysis, including the
procedures for privilege review and production set forth above and the maintenance of
a search log.
