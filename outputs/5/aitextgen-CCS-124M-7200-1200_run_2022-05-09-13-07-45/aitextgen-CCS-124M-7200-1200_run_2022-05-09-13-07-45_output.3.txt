The Software found and possibly used by Leszczynski

The program found on the disk went by the name of Camouflage. It is a
Steganographic Program that hides user selected data inside carrier files. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
attention. For example, you could create a picture file that looks and

behaves exactly like any other picture file but contains hidden encrypted
files, or you could hide a file inside a Word document that would not attract
attention if discovered. Such files can later be safely extracted. For additional
security you can password your camouflaged file. This password will be
required when extracting the files within. You can even camouflage files
within camouflaged files. Camouflage was written for use with Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows NT and Windows 2000, and is simple
to install and use.”

Having started the analysis, a bit-for-bit clone of the memory card should be created and
that clone inserted into the handset. It is good practice that the SIM/IDEN card found in the device
should remain outside of the exhibit for the duration of the examination so as to isolate the device
from the mobile network. However, the majority of devices which contain SIM/IDEN cards require it
to be present within them when they are powered on or they are susceptible to data loss. To
combat this, a laboratory or cloned SIM/IDEN is created and used within the device so that the
device notes the presence of a SIM/IDEN card, but yet is still not able to communicate with any
mobile networks (for further isolation methods, see chapter 3.2.2.2.2). It is worth noting, if a device
used an IDEN card, it is often necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN devices are common.
At this stage, if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination, this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow the forensic solution to upload the device to the device in a particular way, which will allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should

Call logs
Call logs often carry date/time stamps generated from the handsets internal clock. This can
make recovered time stamps on call duty files unreliable. It is often best practice to obtain
billing information from a mobile service provider to confirm time and date information for call
records. This time stamp is obtained from the mobile service provider’s servers and so can be
considered accurate (or rather it is more likely to be accurate).
3.2.2.2.2.3

Application artifacts

Due to the amount of different applications and the multitude of application versions that are
available, it is often necessary to analyse different artifacts unique to different applications. Many
of these applications will, for example, store settings in database files. It may be the case that
deleted database files are recovered and these can be used to ascertain the settings of an
application at a given point in the past. Due to the closed nature of many applications and the lack
of available information, it may often be necessary to obtain a test device and conduct some live
research in order to identify the properties of some application artifacts.

E-mail messages

As with computer-based examinations, e-mail communications on mobile devices can be used within
default Mail applications and through web mail accessed through the internet browser. On some
devices, such as newer Apple iPhones, the extraction of email messages from the default Mail
application is not supported. In these cases the examiner will have to manually record the data or
attempt to gather this data from other sources.

Prosecutor's considerations
The interpretation of the evidence must be taken very seriously and its importance well
understood. Forensic staff must have knowledge or/and pay attention to the procedures to ensure that the
general guidelines are followed at all times:
Handling by specialists: Every kind of electronic device has its own specific
characteristics that require the correct and appropriate procedures must be applied. One
of the greatest risks is the unintentional modification of the evidence. Failure to adhere to
approved procedures is likely to lead to formal challenges in court about data integrity
that can undermine or invalidate the evidence.
Rapid evolution of electronic evidence sources: New technologies are invented and
develop very quickly. Consequently the procedures and techniques to be applied to them
also need to be constantly reviewed and updated.
Use of proper procedures, techniques and tools: As in more traditional forensic
disciplines, digital forensic specialists require special tools and knowledge to undertake
their investigations properly. It is imperative that the correct techniques have been used in the
examination of the digital forensics software and techniques to better understand and enhance its ability to render decisions in criminal cases on cybercrime or
electronic evidence.
Management of the electronic evidence typically includes the following main chapters:

Summary of events and supposition by the investigator

©

The following is the summary of the events; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
stemmed from the lack of basic internet security devices ie a Firewall and AntiVirus
(although from this investigation not even Norton could have helped him). The user
elected to install several ‘free’ internet accelerators and dubious software touting to
be popup stoppers etc.
The installation of several peer-to-peer program facilitated the increase in

downloaded software of dubious sources and the volume of pornography installed
on the system hints to broadband being installed – there is a reference to NTL
broadband medic in the unallocated space but much of this data is corrupt. The
user seems to have become aware of the Spyware as a popup blocker is installed
and a few weeks later the installation of Spyware-blocker is seemingly started,
however possibly due to so many files being infected and corrupted or hardware
failure, the system crashed during the install and despite attempts over several days
the system is never again operational.

It was noted that the user had considered purchasing a new machine as several
references to Dell <www.dell.co.uk> were seen in the cache and the Internet
Explorer history points to the commencement or at least pricing of a Dell
Dimension 2400.

When the system finally fails to boot on 22 August 2004 the user makes the
decision to dispose of it. They remove the memory and, judging by the software
and media players installed (one from X-Men2 and Nero Burning Burning ROM), a
DVDR/CDRW 51/2” device (see the images at the start). Then either believing that
no data can be recovered or not knowing about data forensics, the case is then
dumped at the local refuse facility, where the investigator spots it the next day.

File Timings Explained
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are connected to files that have been
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when they are Modified, Accessed or Created
(called MAC times). Some like many UNIX flavours (inc Linux) apply stamps
time stamps on all activity (unless prohibited by the tool accessing the file).
Microsoft Windows however, will stamp full time and date information on
16 of 57

creation and modification but only dates on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, access it on the 2nd Nov and copy it
onto separate media on the 4th; when the MACs are viewed on the 5th
however, it will appear to have been accessed and modified manually by the user.

igh
ts.

As will be explained in the next section, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained for future use. Thus
when the carried file was used to write the data into an attached file. The
following is a win.ini file, which is why the forensic software stores it was
used for the creation time. To confuse matters more the
modification time was set; when the carrier file was copied to the mobile network, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained the MAC times of the original carried files. Thus
when the carried files are exported from the carrier file a new instance is
written to the new media and although this will have a different creation time
again, it will retain the original accessed and modification times.

This program may have been brought in file by file to prevent detection, as
the CamShell.dll file had deleted been on floppy disk until it was deleted.
The program was probably installed on a Ballard Ind. PC and this could be
confirmed by scanning all systems to which Leszczynski would have had
access, looking for the CamShell.dll file or remnants of it having been there.
