Abstract
This document is submitted as the practical part of the GCIA Certified Forensic
Analyst program (GCFA)1.

ts.

This practical is in two parts, the first of which required an image of a floppy disk to
be analysed and a report submitted based upon the contents. During this part of
the practical, the investigator discovered traces of a steganographic program
(Camouflage.exe). The conclusion being that the owner and holder of the disk had
attempted to export company data via this hidden means.

Given the severity of the incident the following activities are recommended to by
undertaken in priority order to ensure the isolation of devices.
Physical reviews and administrative reviews should be carried out before a case is
labeled as required.
Managers should consider the introduction of recognised, externally audited, standards to maintain
quality, information security and validation of forensic techniques. These standards are described in
ISO 9001 – Information Security and ISO 17025 - Laboratory
Validation.

2.5.6

Streamlined examination and reporting

It is sensible to introduce responsible methods of prioritising workload from the beginning.

By

having a process that identifies the more serious or time critical cases and places them on a
priority level, an effective system is created to support the efficient the staff throughput of urgent
and non-urgent cases. Risk assessment should be undertaken and decisions recorded in all cases
that are considered for streamlined activity or triage. A court should in the future be able to
examine and consider the rationale behind such decisions.
Another consideration that will support the streamlining of examination is to put in place a form of
triage. This triage will allow interim examinations to be conducted in order to establish the
likelihood of a positive result. Several jurisdictions now use a form of streamlined reporting, so that
25

Digital Forensics Guide

a reduced amount of evidence is produced initially, in the anticipation that the defendant will
accept his guilt at court. Where this does not happen and the matter is to be subject of a full court
trial, a more comprehensive examination should be carried out in good time for any trial.

2.5.6

Retention of data

In a busy digital forensics analysis it is important to have a data retention policy in place. If this
is not implemented and followed from the beginning, a situation may quickly arise where there is
insufficient storage available at the laboratory to hold the data. This may be in breach of good
practice and the laboratory may be breaching local data protection legislation. Once implemented
there should be regular checks to make sure the laboratory is still compliant. In some jurisdictions
there are legal requirements for the retention of data, particularly in serious cases. Any such
requirements should be at the forefront of any policy.

2.5.6

Education and training of all stakeholders

At some time the preparation of the laboratory will be underway and the staff will commence their
employment. At this time submissions will be made requiring the digital examination of data. It
must be reinforced to staff and colleagues about what can be reasonably expected from examining
a computer, tablet, phone, or any digital device.
To prevent errors at the time of seizure of electronic evidence, it will be necessary to circulate
instructions and guidance to police officers, which gives them directions in order to fully consider
the implications of their actions at the time of seizing digital devices. Prosecutors and judges
should also be aware of the procedures that the police follow, in order to fully consider
the implications of their actions at the time of seizing digital devices. Prosecutors and judges
should also be aware of the procedures that the police follow, in order to assure themselves that
the correct procedures have been adopted in individual cases they may be prosecuting or
adjudicating.

Digital forensics lab processes and
procedures

This chapter covers the processes and
procedures that typically are involved in a digital forensics analysis, it is important to consider the
role of the steps that is needed to provide a successful digital forensics analysis. The establishment of the
laboratory will allow procedures to be adopted in order to establish the
likelihood of a criminal justice system. A number of judges and judges are becoming increasingly comfortable with cybercrime
and electronic evidence. In some jurisdictions, the growing popularity of prosecutors will
have legal requirements for criminal justice. Although the criminal justice system is publishing new legal findings in the process of
the criminal justice system, the criminal justice system is becoming less visible and hybrid systems emerge as time goes by
and practitioners all over the world are demanding more unified and, above all, more
expedited systems for criminal
