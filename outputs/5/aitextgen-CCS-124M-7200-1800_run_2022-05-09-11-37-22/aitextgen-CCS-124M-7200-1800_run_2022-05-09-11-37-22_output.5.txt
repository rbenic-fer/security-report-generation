facts about the demise of this operating system. I was horrified when I approached
the time line entries for 17 August 2004 as they pointed to the scandisk logs that in
simple black and white showed how the system had not managed to reboot and
correct itself despite numerous attempts – like watching someone drowning I
suppose. Ironically, the fatal blow seems to have come from a piece of software
designed to remove and protect the system from the numerous items of Spyware
and Trojans that it housed.

====================
In the opinion of the expert, On the other hand,
more often would not be specialised in questions of information and communication
technologies.
Therefore, the authenticity of electronic evidence must be ensured in the hands of the judge
(rarely – prosecutors), and examiners should be ready such a development. In such cases the official training
of the judge will be responsible to take into account that not many prosecutors and even a smaller
number of judges feel comfortable with cybercrime, electronic evidence and digital forensic
person in the limits of the law will most probably occur. In such cases the natural reaction is to made to the contents of the legal framework, the forensic
examiner should start with the findings and testing of the believability will most probably occur cases.
Te expert witness status will vary from country to country. In some systems, experts are
engaged by the prosecution and defence, in some systems they are court-appointed and and some other systems (there is some mixed systems in which all parties and the court alike can appoint or
hire expert at different stages of the proceedings. The mixed systems are in some systems for criminal
example the prosecution to the full court will need to decide that in the case the natural reaction is to reject the “probative” decision about the
possibility of the rule of law framework as well as the other international related to the criminal justice process. In some jurisdictions, the
examiner should only request a digital forensics analysis as well as feature-packed suites for criminal justice. In some jurisdictions, the growing popularity of
“deferred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
court and prosecution rooms are not equipped with hardware to support complex
presentations. Expert must be prepared to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. Situations like this should be anticipated by the forensic laboratory
and certified mobile equipment for such presentations can be a useful option.
In conclusion, the presentation stage should be a goal and outcome of all efforts of the
forensic laboratory, examiners and support staff, and should be on the mind of
the personnel involved. The facts and evidence will serve the task for establishing the
material or substantive truth, depending on the legal system. Thez will be used for the
adjudication of criminal law framework, for for justice.
As to breaching Ballard’s own Policies, the involvement of prosecutors will
be needed at different stages to the criminal justice system. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics analysis. In others, the
prosecution will request a digital forensics analysis. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics analysis. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics analysis. In others, the prosecution
will be dealing with three additional types
of crimes, including bestial data forensics, content
of documents and other documents.

What is not possible is that the first check was requested/required by either the user of
the system (upon boot), on 11 Aug 2004 then over the next 11 days a further 23
scans were imitated. This would indicate a failing of either the physical disk, the
operating system or the presence of some software that was causing the system to
crash, whereupon reboot a scandisk would automatically be invoked (and
conducted unless cancelled by the user).
