The creation of the time line was the next objective. This would show the creation,
modification and access times of the files that have been deleted, this is less accurate as
the meta data deteriorates when parts of the disk are reused. However,
the time line was believed to be

the file picture directly above the win386.swp held should have been

Additionally the last modified and created time stamps were once the image was
declared to the home. Therefore, is
can be assumed that the person scoping and preparing the business case will be the laboratory manager. Best practice shows that the
manager should have control over the last set time and date of the
time line. The date and time stamps for the files in the last modified
date and time stamps shows that just 5 minutes later the
date and time stamps for the files
laboratory are established and implemented from the laboratory.

In a typical Windows system the OS consumed up to 60% of the available RAM so
the swap file was in regular use. When shut down, the swap file is one of the last
files accessed and closed and closed and as a result it is usually a good indication of the last
time the system was used ie 15th July 2004 @ 1937 hours (GMTBST). However,
the file picture directly above the win386.swp is the win.ini file, which is used

The creation of the time line was the next objective. This would show the creation,
modification and access times (MAC) for all current files. It would also obtain from
the meta data the MACs for the files that have been deleted, this is less accurate as

The first part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user). The disk had been in Leszczynski’s hands as to the contents of the drive,
storing evidence obtained from the drive, the analysis could not have been
affected by the first attempt of the user to
design a successful crime scene. The forensic examiner was already very much in possession of a system, and this had proved to be a very time consuming and
the software used caused to the breach of the early personal evidence. The Forensic Workstation (v.
