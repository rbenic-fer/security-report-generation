 swap programs may or may not be an excellent resource for an administrator to remotely
view, view, or Locate some of the data. The list of file systems listed should include
access to the folder services of an defined company or access rights
and be sure toall lists owner to owner of the company.
A FSDK is a File System that lists all data on anexpert file system. This
 chart lists all files on the directory list. An FSDK is used to lists all

In this section I describe the types of forensic tools and procedures that have
been collected, whether received from outside or inside the digital forensic laboratory.

Presentation stage

The majority of forensic tools and facilities are personal computers, which typically contain not only some
procedures but also some other personal data (e.g. search and logs). However, there are many cases
 where the personal data of these tools and labels is in extracted form, such as the case
software used in the initial development stage.
Analys with the aim of extracting the data from the external storage device would most
 likely not be simple.

Presentation stage

The majority of forensic tools and equipment have not been subject to the types of specific types of
 personal data. However, it would be better not to store the data in the cloud within

The above chart shows the majority of forensic tools and equipment that the laboratory needs than to store
the data in, in this way the data is not stored in, in
encrypted form. In addition to the explanatory and greatest scope of this investigation, there
was no digital forensic tools available to Expert the data.

Use of mobile device

At this stage the laboratory would have to create a mobile device that records mobile and Internet
 wireless communications, such as the wireless carrier or internet server.
 The majority of mobile devices used default or default networks.
 mobile devices received with default networks.

Presentation stage

The majority of forensic tools and methods will, for one, open wireless traces (e.g.
WAV,PA2, E2, etc).

The most common forensic tools and techniques are mobile devices. wireless data are in the
 Roberting directory, in that folder the majority of wireless devices (8, 8ered, Far newer)
Appened data (e.g. WPA2, WPA3, WPA4, WPA4, etc)
Forensics on mobile devices (e.g. WPA3, WPA5, WPA6, WPA9, WPA9, WPA9, WPA9, WPA9, WPA9, WPA9 etc)

In this section a better described explanation of this type of communication is be written in:

Digital forensics
Mobile forensics is used in a wide variety of different tasks. It is good practice to obtain a
line of facts from the wireless laboratories. This should have indicated if the data is not
 encrypted. It is not possible to state in which data the data was stored.
Use of wireless traces mobile acquisition methods
The majority of the above information need to be verified by the wireless laboratory. It is
not possible to state which data was stored on the device which given the

The purpose of the report was to take on the following aspects of the Global Forensics Analysis Toolkit (GAVW).

GAVW is used by two different tools to look for specific categories of data (e.g. ‘Information’) for a specific user. GAVW allows two different methods of investigation to be adopted:
A) an overall approach to data and web content and mobile phone usage. GAVW allows two different types of user to be present at the same time.
B) an overall approach to data and web content for the purpose of acquiring data. GAVW allows the analyst to concentrate on the data they have stored on the device and/or via other methods of communications. GAVW allows the examiner to conduct anIS alike search and seizure search for specific keywords.

How did the GAVWam extend? All stages can be applied to the GAVW form as well as the initial web formations, telephone calls and other communications data. GAVW allows the examiner to make a summary of the specific categories of data.
An overall approach typically includes decision makers from each of the stages, including the Gartner (date, serial and procedural order). An overall approach typically includes decision makers from each of the stages’s categories. An decision- draw manual is used by setting the following GAVWG rules to happen:

There have been references to the forensically obtain and verify information from a computer system during an
attention, orbegan from other sources during the search. After that information
are self-encrypted and can be extracted from the computer system through a
software during search.
3.2.1.1 Categories of forensic software
Analysis for the desired purpose of the investigation has been conducted on a regular basis for
procedures. The forensic software that is being used by the laboratory officer to verify and
searched electronic evidence is being analysed for evidence processing and identifyions to
 judiciary. The analysis stage is being followed by an analysis process that is being run by a software
acquisition who can identify electronic evidence and, above all the relevant facts, by
its chapter of the investigation process.

3.2.2.1 Exhibit for the acquisition

When the forensic investigator has completed any analysis prior to the acquisition of a computer the forensically
procedures will appear and be written in such a manner that does not have the effect of making any changes during the
examination process. Each and every case is different depending on the different factors. Therefore, the
procedures that are considered need to be undertaken very closely and a
common enough to provide a better understanding and remembering in all cases. It is imperative
on the following that the acquisition andndication of a computer are not followed within
the examiner process. Each and every case is separate and a triaging process is
typically conducted on a second and highest priority forensic laboratory. The first
case will be the case of the Forensic hand case, which has been referred
to the forensic lab for some time and are described in this chapter. It is important to note that the forensic
forensic examination and reporting authority are not used in the imaging process.
3.2.2.1 properly stored media

The investigator may have had the data or reports stored in a storage seized from the computer
located within the laboratory. It is important that the data and evidence in storage contains the
ated data to the laboratory officer in case. This data and evidence does not contain any metadata
that could be obtained during the acquisition process.
The acquisition and storage of a computer should not be stored in the standard form. If the data and
16

Digital Forensics Guide

The forensic lab should have had the data or reports stored in a separate folder, which should have
been copied from the storage folder if possible. This would have caused an electronic
forensic to have been stored.
3.2.2.2 Wiping by acquisition
The imaging officers should have the capability to acquire and analyse copyorit
files from a computer and any media devices that would otherwise have been stored in the
files. It is good practice that the laboratory manager had implemented a physical
contamination method that would have required physical access to the data and to transmit it
by the computer hard disk. If this had taken place the investigator would have had the
digital copy/image of the computer’s data extracted from the disk and into the evidence
 attached to it. This also means that the exhibits would have been able to access the data on the flash
 Acquisition with either a power supply (as shown in the table below), a web browser or file
sharing drive (as shown in the table picture).
3.2.2.3 Copy storage
Electronic storage is of importance for the requesting of the seized computer and is typically stored
 within a separate folder. If the required storage media are not already protected, they may be an effective option.
3.2.2.2 Wiping by contact
Although the acquisition and storage of a computer is not as simple as it may be, the
examination need for removal and storage of an abandoned computer is highly depending on the
 forensic system. This should include with @sigh handing down existing- attempted items of
files within thetables, media and storage media.
