Abstract
This document is submitted as the practical part of the GCIA Certified Forensic
Analyst program (GCFA)1.

fu
ll r

igh
ts.

This practical is in two parts, the first of which required an image of a floppy disk to
be analysed and a report submitted based upon the contents. During this part of
the practical, the investigator discovered traces of a steganographic program
(Camouflage.exe). The conclusion being that the owner and holder of the disk had
attempted to export company data via this hidden means.

rr

eta

ins

The second part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user).

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.

Background

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

Log entry found: Firewall (Type: Firewall)  The memory dump can be analysed in
the forensics laboratory.
Understanding memory structures of different operating systems in order to analyse RAM is a
highly technical task. That is why it should only be done by examiners who are qualified for this
work. Specialised software is requited to analyse RAM dumps. Examples for such software include
"Volatility" and "Rekall". Typical artefacts that can be extracted from RAM dumps include:


Running processes including their memory



Process information (e.g. handles)



Encryption keys



Opened files



Usernames, passwords



Unsaved documents



and many more.

3.4.1.3 Virtualisation
A picture is worth a thousand words - this is particularly true for virtualisation. The forensic analyst
can view the operating system environment from a suspect's computer the same way as the
suspect has seen it. Finding evidence from within a virtual machine can sometimes be faster and
more expressive than reassembling data traces from the file system.
The forensic analyst should ensure that the image is mounted write-protect with a write cache
allowing the virtual operating system to write log files and changes to that write cache without
affecting the integrity of the image. Some operating systems refuse to start in virtual
environments. This can typically be solved by replacing drivers and adapting configurations, using
software like OpenGates and OpenJobs. Should the virtual operating system start with a password
prompt the forensic analyst needs to either crack that password or blank it.
3.4.1.4 Process for handling mass data
Some cases involve lots of computer systems and storage media while the workload for the
forensic laboratories is already very high. A separation between forensic analysis and content

analysis can spread the work more evenly between the digital forensics analysts and the case
investigators. The forensic analysts can concentrate on recovering, parsing, mounting containers, mounting containers, mounting containers, breaking encryption
devices while the content analysis is being done by investigators with case
knowledge. A process needs to be in place and the software and overhanding techniques
supporting this process need to be in place (e.g. container file provided by forensic analyst to
investigator, viewer component to be used by investigator, handing back the finding to the forensic
analyst).
3.4.1.5 Visualisation aids
For aiding in visualisation of complex data structures, visualisation aids can be helpful. Examples
for those aids are:


Timelines: Indicating the behaviour of the user: When did the suspect log in, when did he
connect a certain medium, when did he connect to which wireless lan, when did he view
which website, etc.



Relationship diagrams: Can give answers to the questions: Who has met whom at which
point of time using which medium? Which information was sent/received? Who knows
whom? Who is the main suspect who coordinated the others?



Moneyflow diagrams: Can help to understand at which point of time which amount of
money has been sent over which channel by which persons.



Communication diagrams: Similar to a relationshop diagram but does not necessarily
involve persons. It could show how often which IP addresses attacked a server from
which country.

Graphical representations make it easier to understand the correlation between the data. They can
also enable the investigator to find new links. Typically the basis for such diagrams are raw data
which are stored in a structured way, e.g. csv/tsv files. Those files are loaded into specialised
commercial or some free software. On Linux for example simple commands like awk, sort, uniq
used in conjunction with Graphviz or dot can help drawing graphical representations of the likely need for future use.

Mobile devices contain records and logs of communications, along with times and dates of said
communications. In addition to this, mobile devices will also contain media files and location data
that can be utilised in an investigation.

Digital traces found on mobile devices can be split into three distinct groups: communication data,
media files and other data. Communication data can include call records, SMS messages and other
messaging service messages. Media files, as with computers, can contain information beyond what

Next a file timeline was created from all Allocated and Unallocated space on the
drive including the Unallocated Data structures. This would show the order in
which files were created, modified and deleted. The file was created by Autopsy
and as the ‘output/body’ file was created an md5 hash of the file was also written to
the working folder (/forensics/floppy/FloppyDisk/). The final step for this
item was to create the time-line file from the body with a start and end point. As
Floppy disk contained small amounts of data a complete timeline was requested
and this was saved as ‘output/total-timeline’.

The timeline would be later analysed and referred to as a key reference document,
indicating file activity and user actions. As the timeline related to a floppy disk the
activity recorded would primarily be that of the user as systems are rarely able to
page or record system activity to the media (limited volume size, slow read and
write speed coupled with a lack of system pre-notification as to its removal)

Although the names of the pornography video files did include on several occasions
the words rape, the belief is that many are either ‘staged’ or simply advertising tricks
to increase hits. Note – this was a database that had been created by a technically proficient person unless the
forensic laboratory utilises on of these files.
The user’s role is to give up on which the disk records were
presented.
Fortunately the Camouflage program stores the original MAC times from the
files as can be seen in items 20 and 21.
Once the Camouflage program had been used to make carrier files out of the

Microsoft does note record access times, only dates, specific data is not
available.

As Mr RJ Leszczynski, went to leave the building at the end of the day day day he
was stopped and the disk impounded. As the disk is logically labelled with
his initials and he was in possession of it when stopped, it is suggested that
Mr RJ Leszczynski was exporting information that he had access to, to
outside the boundary of Ballard Ind. However, analysis of his work pc would
reveal more information about his activities, and it is recommended that this
is undertaken before it is used/switched on again.

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ

briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
