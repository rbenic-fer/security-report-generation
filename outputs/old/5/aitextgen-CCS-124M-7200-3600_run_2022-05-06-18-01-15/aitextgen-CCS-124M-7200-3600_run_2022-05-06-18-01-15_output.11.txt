Appendices



Appendix A – Comparison of forensic software
All appendices in section A are templates and should aid laboratory managers to develop their own comparison matrix in order to make an educated decision about software, hardware
and training purchases. In some tables, exemplary data are provided for better understanding. It is important to understand that each forensic laboratory might have its’ own
prerequisites, demands and maybe even legal framework (e.g. mandatory list of court-validated software). While one lab might have a majority of cases involving recovery of files and
filesystems another lab might only have cases where large amounts of documents and e-mails might need to be analysed. While the first laboratory might choose one particular forensic
software that suits their requirements (excellent data carving, file system support and recovery capabilities) the other laboratory might aim for another solution that fits their demands
better. There cannot be one definite recommendation for a specific software that is the universal best solution for all digital forensic laboratories.

Please remember that results from each individual software should be double-checked. The ideal situation is that the results are double-checked by manually analysing the raw data.
Depending on the data and on the knowledge of the examiner this might not be possible in any case. In this case the results of the first tool should be checked against the results of a
second tool. Some legislations even require dual-tool verification legally. Thus, it is good practise to have more than one forensic software available at a forensic lab in order to crosscheck the results.

A.1) Available software for digital forensics laboratories
A variety of different software is needed in order to run a digital forensics laboratory. This includes case management software as well as feature-packed suites for computer and mobile forensics.
Depending on the tasks of the laboratory additional specialised software may be required. The number of forensic big and small software solutions is huge and very agile. Especially the open
source community is publishing new tools nearly every day. It is not the aim of this guide to provide a full list of all available tools. However, to provide a better overview that can assist in the
development of a comparison matrix a list of useful resources is given below.

A.2) Cost overview of standard software for forensic analysis
Remember: All costs for software, hardware and training are reoccurring expenses. While the initial purchase of a forensic software is usually a one-time cost the reoccurring costs for
annual license renewals should never be forgotten. Since the prices of license updates and service subscriptions may differ significantly depending on the product it is important to
pay attention to those costs. Besides that, hardware needs to be renewed on a regular basis in order to maximise the performance of the evidence processing and to meet the
requirements of updated forensic software. In addition to that even the training costs are reoccurring because digital forensics examiners need continuous professional education.

Category of the evidence can be acquired in a re-ghosted manner.
In order to acquire the evidence from a running computer forensics laboratory.
Depending on the size of the laboratory and the amount of electronic evidence to
be examined, an additional amount of digital forensic big difference is to the amount of data
for every case. In a busy digital forensics laboratory it is important to have a data retention policy in place. If this
is not implemented and followed from the beginning, a situation may quickly arise where there is
insufficient storage available at the laboratory to hold the data. This may be in breach of good
practice and the laboratory may be breaching local data protection legislation. Once implemented
there should be regular checks to make sure the laboratory is still compliant. In some jurisdictions
there are legal requirements for the retention of data, particularly in serious cases. Any such
requirements should be at the forefront of any policy.

Education and training of all stakeholders

At some time the preparation of the laboratory will be underway and the staff will commence their
employment. At this time submissions will be made requiring the digital examination of data while
the staff will use this viewing capability will ensure it looks authentic and does not exhibit any traits suggesting that
the data may have been modified or tampered with before or during the imaging process. Devices
can be self-encrypted or they can have a layer of protection that only allows communication when
the device is attached to a certain trusted platform. Imaging such devices can produce a valid
hash-verification even though the data that have been copied are not usable for a forensic analysis.
Please note that hash verification for solid-state drives and flash-media that has its own controller
will most likely fail because the controller of the medium might have changed
