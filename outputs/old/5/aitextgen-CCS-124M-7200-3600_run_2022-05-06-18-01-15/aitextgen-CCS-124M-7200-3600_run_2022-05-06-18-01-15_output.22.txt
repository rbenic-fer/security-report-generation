This did present a problem as to this point no passwords had been recovered, either
in text files on in the form of an obvious file or text in a file on the disk.

Passwords
The investigator then tried a few default passwords, starting with “password” which
was rejected. The next one tried was “Password” this was the correct password as
the image below shows the contents of the Camouflaged file.

The “Password” was then tried on the other potential carrier file but it was not

the strings file for the FD to glean any possible password. After some time and
after trying several dozen passwords gold was struck. It closer examination
indicated that the password for the Password_Policy.doc file was the first part of
the file name, thus “Remote” was tried on the Remote_Access_Policy.doc file
and the following files were revealed to inside the carrier.

The question as to whether the use conducted any illegal activity can be a difficult
one to answer as it can depend on many things. The pornography for example is
explicit but as to its breach of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 & 64 (OPA) the
investigator turned to the Internet Watch Foundation <www.ifw.org.uk> for advice.

Abstract
This document is submitted as the practical part of the GCIA Certified Forensic
Analyst program (GCFA)1.

fu

igh
ts.

This practical is in two parts, the first of which required an image of a floppy disk to
be analysed and a report submitted based upon the contents. During this part of
the practical, the investigator discovered traces of a steganographic program
(Camouflage program). The conclusion being that the owner and holder of the disk had
attempted to export company data via this hidden means.

rr

eta

ins

The second part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user).

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

fu
ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

eta

ins

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and information leakage and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

ho

rr

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis was a single Floppy Disk. The disk
received was identified and described as:
