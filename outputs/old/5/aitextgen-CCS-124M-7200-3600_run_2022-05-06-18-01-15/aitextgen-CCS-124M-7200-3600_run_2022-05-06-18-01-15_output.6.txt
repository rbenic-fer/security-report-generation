A quick read of the Readme.txt file gleaned the advisory that the use of notepad.exe
could compromise the presence of the encrypted data as it would display all data.

This opening with notepad was performed on all live files on the floppy disk and as

To test theory the Camouflage program was run for against the

This did present a problem as to this point no passwords had been recovered, either
in text files on in the form of an obvious file or text in a file on the disk.

Passwords
The investigator then tried a few default passwords, starting with “password” which
was rejected. The next one tried was “Password” this was the correct password as
the image below shows the contents of the Camouflaged file.

The “Password” was then tried on the other potential carrier file but it was not

indicated that the password for the Password_Policy.doc file was the first part of

File Timings Explained
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when they are Modified, Accessed or Created
((called MAC times). Some like many UNIX flavours (inc Linux) apply stamps
time stamps on all activity (unless prohibited by the tool accessing the file).
Microsoft Windows however, will stamp full time and date information on

creation and modification but only date information on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, access it on the 2nd Nov, modify

File 'Exploit_Office' contains 
them all data of the original content within a Word document that has been produced in an appendix.
Fortunately the Camouflage program stores the original MAC times from the
files as can be seen in items 20 and 21.
Once the Camouflage program had been used to make carrier files out of the
Password_Policy.doc and Remote_Assess_Policy.doc files [believed
to be 23 Apr 2004 @ 1155 & 1154 hours respectively].
These carrier files and four other word documents (policy documents from
Ballard Ind.) were copied onto the Floppy disk [believed to be 26 Apr 2004 @

0946 hours]. These files accessed at some point on 26 Apr 2004, but as
Microsoft does note record access times, only dates, specific data is not
available.

As Mr RJ Leszczynski, went to leave the building at the end of the day day day day day day day he
was stopped and the disk impounded. As the disk is logically labelled with
his initials and he was in possession of it when stopped, it is suggested that
Mr RJ Leszczynski was exporting information that he had access to, to
outside the boundary of Ballard Ind. However, analysis of his work pc would
reveal more information about his activities, and it is recommended that this
is undertaken before it is used/switched on again.

The Software found and possibly used by Leszczynski

The program found on the disk went by the name of Camouflage. It is aSteganographic Program that hides user selected data inside carrier files. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
attention. For example, you could create a picture file that looks and

behaves exactly like any other picture file but contains hidden encrypted
files, or you could hide a file inside a Word document that would not attract
attention if discovered. Such files can later be safely extracted. For additional
security you can password your camouflaged file. This password will be
required when extracting the files within. You can even camouflage files
within camouflaged files. Camouflage was written for use with Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT and Windows 2000, and is simple
to install and use.”

This document is submitted as the practical part of the GCIA Certified Forensic
Analyst program (GCFA)1.

This practical is in two parts of the practical, the first of which required an image of a floppy disk to
be analysed and a report submitted based upon the contents. During this part of
the practical, the investigator discovered traces of a steganographic program
(Camouflage.exe). The conclusion being that the owner and holder of the disk had
attempted to export company data via this hidden means.

The second part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user).

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.
