The second part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator was no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user).

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

fu
ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

eta

ins

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and information leakage and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis was a single Floppy Disk. The disk
received was identified and described as:

====================
Note of eviction contains attachment 'Exploit_Office'. Attachment is quarantined on 'Mail server EP'. and this was a
failure as the of their own progress. It is envisaged that this area would be less secure than the rest of the
laboratory so no case papers or sensitive paperwork should be stored in this area.
Secure property store – This facility should be large enough to store various items of computer
and mobile phone evidence for a significant period of time. Computers can come in all shapes and
sizes and some servers are very large and heavy. Especially the open
sourcesource facility should be a
secure room with access control. It should be situated close to reception and close to the Imaging
area to avoid the need to carry heavy items too far. Ideally you should install strong shelving and a
numbering system to segregate the exhibits to allow easy identification of exhibits for each case.
Consider purchasing plastic boxed to house the smaller exhibits. The exact location of the exhibits
for each case should be noted in the case management system and exhibits returned to the same
location once imaging has been concluded. It may also be worth considering isolating the secure
store from radio waves by implementing Faraday shielding. This will ensure the isolation of devices
with wireless communication capabilities. There have been reported instances of the contents of
mobile devices being remotely deleted while in police custody. A Faraday cage is very expensive
and the use of Faraday bags may be an alternative. As a last resort, completely enclosing the
devices in strong silver foil as a temporary measure will prevent communication with devices.
Forensic imaging department – The imaging department will require a large, clean surface area
preferably with raised edges to prevent the loss of screws and small components, whilst computers
are being dismantled for acquisition. Anti-static mats should be on all work surfaces. An area for
digital camera and battery chargers should be arranged, as all evidence should be photographed
prior to imaging. Each imager will require a desk area large enough to hold two monitors and two
computers, acquisition hardware, telephone and paperwork. A chair for each imager, preferably a
comfortable operator’s chair, with lumbar support and height adjustment should also be provided.
Analyst work station - The digital forensics analyst will require a large desk area big enough to
hold several monitors, two computers, various paperwork, mobile devices and mobile device
extraction hardware and tools. Again a comfortable chair would be beneficial due to the amount of
time spent sat at the monitor. It would also be advisable to position the desks to avoid others from
22

accidentally viewing sensitive data on the screens – or put privacy screens between the
workstations to provide a cubicle type environment.
Server room – The space allocated to central server will need to be secure due to the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room for resilience like UPS.

2.5.2

Software and hardware

Hardware - The digital forensic laboratory should be a high tech environment with lots of sensitive
data being analysed and stored. As such, it will require an examination network, which is isolated
from any external connections. As all laboratory staff will use this network it will need to be
resilient, secure and fast. When setting up any server or system, best practice would be to opt for
the highest available processing power and a suitable data storage array.
This system must provide Internet access to the team, either individually supplied to all hosts or
just to one dedicated computer within the laboratory. This should allow analysts and staff easy use
for checking emails, downloading patches, updates and tools.
Any analyst would prefer that two monitors make their work easier. When it comes to building their
final reports it is much easier to have the report open on one screen and their investigation on the
other. It can also assist when viewing a high quantity of thumbnails. Whilst this is extra expense,
the benefits of having this viewing capability will provide time saving benefits along with a robust
system that can support the analysts provide more accurate reports for evidence.
Those responsible for imaging computers will require sanitised storage disks and write blockers to
prevent any changes in data and the integrity of the original evidence. There are numerous types
of write blockers on the market and several software tools that can also be used.
In addition to backing up operating data, the laboratory will be dealing with three additional types
of storage issues; the original evidence, the forensically created images and the data generated
after the investigation. Consideration must be given as to how this is all to be stored, archived and
backed up. A stringent back up

3.2.1 Exhibit Handling
Forensic officers must use extra care when handling mobile devices, as they contain batteries and
can easily be powered on accidentally. This is likely to change evidential data in the process, such
as time and date information for last use. Experts should pay special attention during initial
handling to identify power buttons and to provide network isolation at all times.
The ‘Isolation’ phase is essential, as many devices require acquisitions to be conducted when it is
‘Live.’ This means that the examiner will be required to power the device on in order to use the
device functioning throughout the acquisition. If the mobile device is not isolated and allowed to
connect to external networks, such as the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connection, data may be changed on the device. One example is that it is possible to remotely wipe
some mobile devices.
Isolation can be achieved through different forms:


Production of a ‘Laboratory SIM/IDEN card’ – a SIM/IDEN card that appears to the
device as the original SIM/IDEN card but lacks the capability to actually connect to the
mobile network. A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) / Integrated Digital Enhanced
Network (IDEN) identifies the subscriber to the network which the mobile device wishes to
connect to



Acquisition in a network shielded room – a dedicated laboratory with Faraday
shielding installed to prevent network isolation.



Use of wireless jamming equipment – equipment can be acquired that can jam and
prevent wireless signals from reaching the exhibit. These devices are illegal in some
36

Digital Forensics Guide

jurisdictions.
The best method will depend on local laws, laboratory set up and on the device being examined.
Consideration should also be applied to prevent connection to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals.
Before proceeding with acquiring the mobile device exhibit, it must be identified. The device will
often have an equipment label affixed to the inside of the handset, if it is a mobile telephone, or
printed on the back of the device. The label will include an International Mobile Equipment Identify
Number (IMEI), a Mobile Equipment Identity Number (MEID) or Serial Number. This data can be
used to uniquely identify the devices and is important for requesting billing records or conducting
cell site analysis later. The make, model and IMEI/MEID can then be used to look up the device
using your forensic packages to determine what level of support is available (for information
regarding the different levels of support, see chapter 3.2.2.6).
Also at this stage, a review of the case paperwork supplied with the exhibit from the officer in
charge should be undertaken to ascertain what evidence is required from the device. This can help
the examiner make a decision in regards to what level of examination should be undertaken, i.e. if
deleted data is required then a physical examination should be sort for. An attempt should also be
made to gather any known passcodes, passwords or patterns from the device’s owner prior to the
full examination. This will ensure that no matter what level of support is available for the device, at
least access can be granted to the data that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN cards or memory cards. This plan should include the acquisition of data from the SIM /
IDEN card(s) and memory card(s) (if applicable) and what level of exam is going to be undertaken
and why. The examiner should also plan a second level of exam in case the first level of exam is
not successful due to various difficulties, i.e. a broken or ineffective power button (see chapter
3.2.2.2.6 for levels of examination).
3.2.2.2 Wiping imaging media / sterilising / cross-contamination
When producing images of the mobile devices, it is considered best practice to use a clean target
medium, which does not contain any data relating to any previously examined exhibits. If using
laboratory or cloned SIM cards, exam

Mobile ATI card with a 1024x768 TFT screen. It boasts a IEEE 1394 port as well as
2 x USB 2 ports. This laptop has more than proven itself in the past and the
performance of each of the components has been well above standard without the
need for specialist drivers. It will accept over 15 different distributions of Linux and
has run Windows from 95 – 2003 Enterprise Server. As the caddie cost in the
region of £30 (~$55), the Main Forensic OS was a free distribution(FC2) and the
laptop (inc 2 extra HDD and internal caddie drives) cost £550 (~$1030) the whole
forensic outfit was comparatively cheep £580 ($1085).

The only glitch that was with the use of the external caddie which
connects IDE devices to either IEEE 1394 or USB2. While MS Windows was able
to address the device, Fedora Core 2 did not have any support for it in the kernel.
That said some research on the internet did reveal a patch had been submitted (see
below) which when applied allowed the external caddie to be mounted in the running of a game in the user defined folder (similar to the current
files timecode, malfunction, etc.).

Not really, but if you only need to copy files from Linux to Windows on a dual-boot
machine, see "How to write to NTFS" below for a possible way to work around the lack of
write support. For write support in Linux, read on.
There are two drivers, currently. The original driver, in 2.4 has some write code in it, but it is
extremely dangerous to use it. The possibility of destroying your filesystem is very high.
