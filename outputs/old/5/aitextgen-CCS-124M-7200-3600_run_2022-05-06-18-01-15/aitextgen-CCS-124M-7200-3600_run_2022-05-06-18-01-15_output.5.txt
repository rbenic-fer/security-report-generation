====================
In the opinion of the expert,  pursuant to the complex issues of science and technology plays an increasing role in litigation. It is important
for digital forensics analysts to submit written reports when performing anyanalysis at the trial stage. The demeanor
20

and behavior of laboratory staff should be ensured throughout the organisation.
The job of the acquisition process is to produce
an identical copy or image of the original content of any digital storage seized. Depending on the size of the laboratory and the required number of forensic big and small software solutions being applied. It is important to consider that all digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
Digital forensics analyst – mobile devices
The analysts will require technical knowledge, and where possible appropriate qualifications. Ideally
they should have some training in the use of Faraday bags may be an alternative. As a last resort, completely enclosing the
devices in strong silver foil as a temporary measure will prevent communication with devices.
Forensic officers must use extra care when handling mobile devices, as they will require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
The possibility to acquire the answer to answer the questions will be more involved in the expertise processes. The roles and evidence will
often be more involved in the expertise processes, including involvement in particular
phases of the process itself. It is vital that digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
The possibility to acquire and verify the result of the digital forensic laboratory. One of the
most important things to be considered should be cataloguing of the steps and evidence
which is gathered and secured.
Often evidence will be present in great numbers and their bulleting and listing can be
time consuming. Nevertheless, one must be persistent in this process having in mind
that this approach will lead to a logical explanation of the chain of evidence and the
criminal act itself.
The interpretation of the evidence must be taken very seriously and its importance well
understood. Forensic staff must be aware they will be summoned by the court and be in
a position to explain their procedures and findings in detail; their statements will be
examined both by the prosecution and defence, and, depending on the system, by the
judiciary. This situation can be of crucial importance importance for the success or failure of the
case and it must be taken seriously.
The analysis of the evidence should lead to clear and logical conclusions which should be
able to sustain significant examination during the trial.

3.5

Presentation stage

After evidence has been found in the analysis stage, the examiner needs to create a report for the
trial. The examiner’s job is to illustrate and to translate complicated technical contexts into facts
that judges, prosecutorial and other parties involved can easily be easily expected to interpret traces
that judges, especially in a busy digital forensics laboratory might not be able to
examine.
The authenticity of the evidence must be ensured throughout thedigital forensics arena. It is important that the digital
forensics analyst does not state something in the report that he cannot prove, e.g. "The suspect
has done A, B, C"; it is only possible to state "With this computer, at this point of time, using user
account XY, file A has been created, USB thumb drive B has been attached and in inbox of webmail
account C has been visited."
A digital forensics report should consist of the following main chapters:
1.

Information about the request and the mandate

2.

Information about the exhibits

3.

Information about the examination methods (persons/software/hardware)

4.

Acquisition process

During forensic examiners may prioritise certain devices or data and will produce an
exact copy or image of the content of any digital storage seized. Working on the duplicate (never
the original) they can apply smart, case-specific filters (data mining) or they can just process the
image (e.g. recovering deleted files, mounting containers, breaking encryption, parsing
application data like internet history, chat logs, etc.). Those processing steps are often times
repeatable
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  It is important
for the digital forensics analysts to be expert in all stages of the process having the necessary and written reports to assist them in the development of their digital forensics
understanding. Forensic experts must be aware not only of the applicable methods; their actual exhibits and the
reports that are required.
The installation of suitable premises will vary from country to country. In some parts of the legal framework, the growing popularity of
“Theerred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
court and prosecution rooms are not equipped with hardware to support complex
presentations. Expert must be prepared to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. Situations like this should be anticipated by the forensic laboratory
and certified mobile equipment for such presentations can be a useful option.
In conclusion, the presentation stage should be a goal and outcome of all efforts of the
forensic laboratory, examiners and support staff, and should always be on the mind of
the personnel involved. The facts and evidence will serve the task for establishing the function of the acquisition, processing analysing and presenting electronic
evidence.
It is important that digital forensic analysts have good knowledge and written communication
skills.
The Guide and IMEI/MEID can then be used to look up the device
using your forensic packages to determine what level of support is available (for information
regarding the different levels of support, see chapter 3.2.2.6).
Also at this stage, a review of the case paperwork supplied with the exhibit from the officer in
charge should be undertaken to ascertain what evidence is required from the device. This can help
the examiner make a decision in regards to what level of examination should be undertaken, i.e. if
deleted data is required then a physical examination should be sort for. An attempt should also be
made to gather any known passcodes, passwords or patterns from the device’s owner prior to the
full examination. This will ensure that no matter what level of support is available for the device, at
least access can be granted to the data that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN cards or memory cards. This plan should include the acquisition of data from the SIM /
IDEN card(s) and memory card(s) (if applicable) and what level of exam is going to be undertaken
and why. The examiner should also plan a second level of exam in case the first level of exam is
not successful due to various difficulties, i.e. a broken or ineffective power button (see chapter
3.2.2.6 for levels of examination).
3.2.2.2.2 Wiping imaging media / sterilising / cross-contamination
When producing images of the mobile devices, it is considered best practice to use a clean target
medium, which does not contain any data relating to any previously examined exhibits. If using
laboratory or cloned SIM cards, examiners must ensure that the laboratory SIM card contains the
data from the last inserted SIM card.
3.2.2.3 Write blocking
Due to some specific extraction techniques, such as iOS Boot loader extractions and rooting of
Android devices, it is not always possible to implement write-blocking. Where possible writeblocking should be implemented, for example the extraction of memory cards, however it is widely
acknowledged that this is not always possible or practical when working with mobile devices. For
this reason it is imperative that the examiner is fully aware of the consequences of their actions
when handling mobile devices and is able to explain these actions in a coherent fashion.

3.2.4 Acquisition process
It is important that, at all stages of an examination, the mobile device under scrutiny is isolated
from all external connections. This prevents the device from altering any stored data. A number of
modern devices have the capacity to be remotely (and securely) wiped. Isolating the devices will
help to prevent this from happening.
Mobile devices are presented with three distinct media that require separate handling and
investigation techniques:


SIM / IDEN Cards – Requires specialist mobile phone forensic tools and equipment.



Memory Cards – Can be examined as a computer hard disk or flash drive.



Device’s Internal Memory – Requires specialist forensic tools and software.

UPDATE may be dismissed.
The expert
can take into account that processes and procedures in the forensics laboratory may or may not be under scrutiny of the public or state prosecutor, but one thing should always
28

Digital Forensics Guide

be on the mind of laboratory staff: facts discovered and evidence produced is always
going to end in the hands of a prosecutors who will be responsible to render lawful
decisions about the fate of the case and it’s perpetrator.
The aim of the investigation should always be two-fold: acquisition of all existing
evidence with regards to the case, and ability to reproduce and explain the forensic
procedure which led to the acquisition.
Prosecutors should be interested in all stages of the process, but they will most
probably focus on the acquisition and presentation stages.
On some occasions, the acquisition stage will be the first encounter of the prosecutor
with the electronic evidence in a criminal case. Often, this contact will happen during
the on call duty and maybe during late hours. With an increasing role of prosecutors
within criminal law systems, they are in charge of decision making throughout the public or state prosecutor, and given the number of
expedited decisions about the fate of the case and it is in question of decision making throughout the public.
Prosecutors must be aware that given the equality of arms the defence will be likely to move onto other job opportunities
and to ensure the integrity of the evidence and the validity of the findings.
Examiners should be aware that given the equality of arms the defence will be likely to engage expert witnesses of their own progress in the court.

Validating the evidence and procedures in the forensics laboratory may or be one officer with a
computer and freely available forensic tools. Anyone responsible for the success of their actions
within the criminal justice system should carefully research the requirements and functions
must be put in place to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
Prosecutors must be aware that given the equality of arms the defence will be likely to engage expert witnesses of their own progress in order to understand and
disprove disputed facts.
The minimum entries for a case management system should be as follows:


Date, time and person delivering and receiving the exhibit to the laboratory.



Unique reference number – software generated.



The common reference number must be as follows:


The common exhibit reference number must be unique to the user and/or
provider
