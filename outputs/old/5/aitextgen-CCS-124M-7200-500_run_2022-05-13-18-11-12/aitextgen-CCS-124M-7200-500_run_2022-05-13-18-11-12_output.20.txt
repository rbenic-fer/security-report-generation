The second phase of this practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the user). The disk had been in Leszczynski’s hands as to the contents of the drive,
 whether the object is to be in any other stage, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the system, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

files accessed and closed and closed. If the machine is in any other stage and in any subsequent steps the system is in question
limited the right of the user. If the machine is in any other stage, take a screenshot of the contents of the drive. If the machine is in any other stage, then a next step is to
undelete files and folders. The next step is to
undelete files and folders from a forensic workstation or imaging server. After that, additional files can be recovered by
scanning the unallocated areas for known file headers and footers (carving). It is important that the disk is not only in cases of serious criminal activity but could potentially potentially not be easily damaged by
