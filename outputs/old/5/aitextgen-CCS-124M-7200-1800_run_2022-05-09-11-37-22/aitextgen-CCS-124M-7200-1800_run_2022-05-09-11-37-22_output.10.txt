In addition to the above, absent
backdating and manipulation of the data, it is the necessary to circulate
instructions and guidance to police officers, which gives them directions in order to fully consider
the implications of their actions at the time of seizing digital devices. Prosecutors and judges
should also be aware of the procedures that the police follow, in order to fully consider
the implications of their actions
when handling electronic evidence.

3.2.2

Digital forensics lab processes and
procedures

This chapter covers the processes and procedures that typically are involved in a digital forensics
examination. An overall, chronological process model is used in order to provide a better overview
over the main main processes.
During all phases of a digital forensics examination it is vital to remember the special
characteristics of electronic evidence as laid out in the Electronic Evidence Guide.
Electrical Safety Check sticker on the other of the items to include in the Electronic Evidence Guide and the
 Electronic Evidence Media to indicate the
acquisition.

Digital forensics analyst – mobile devices
The analysts will concentrate on recovering, parsing, and
all possible stages to achieve the same quality of
the acquired evidence. In some jurisdictions, the growing popularity of
“password” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well.
3.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.4

In some jurisdictions, the growing popularity of
“password” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
court and prosecution rooms are not equipped with hardware to support complex
presentations. Expert must be prepared to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. Situations like this should be anticipated by the forensic laboratory
and certified mobile equipment for such presentations can be a useful option.
In conclusion, the presentation stage should be a goal and outcome of the
forensic laboratory, examiners and support staff, and should always be on the mind of
the personnel involved. The facts and evidence will serve the task for establishing the
material or substantive truth, depending on the legal system. Thez will be used for the
adjudication of the criminal justice system, for justice and for the compensation of victims.
The role and responsibility of digital forensic examiners are thus crucial for criminal
justice.

Appendix A – Comparison of forensic software
All appendices in section A are templates and should aid laboratory managers to develop their own comparison matrix in order to make an educated decision about software, hardware
and training purchases. In some tables, exemplary data are provided for better understanding. It is important to understand that each forensic laboratory might have its’ own
prerequisites, demands and maybe even legal framework (e.g. mandatory list of court-validated software). While one lab might have a majority of cases involving recovery of files and
filesystems another lab might only have cases where large amounts of documents and e-mails might need to be analysed. While the first lab might choose one particular forensic
software that suits their requirements (excellent data carving, file system support and recovery capabilities) the other laboratory might aim for

If that hadn’t worked the cookies were the next stop. Oh and notice the dell cookie
on the 13 August 2004, it connects (time wise) to some images in the Internet
Explorer History directory they show Dell 2400 desktop system 33 – wonder if the
user was getting frustrated with their slow and dated operating system that was
creaking under all the additional program running. These were drawn together in a
search for all text files, as the investigator looked for logs etc, notice again how the
numbers of log files and other text files modified and created comes to a grinding
halt in 2 days.

During this analysis, Stroz Friedberg employed a methodology tailored to the particular
facts of this case. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included: (1) conducting keyword and
other searches of the digital forensic copies of the Ceglia Media and other data,
including webmail accounts, to identify responsive documents or fragments of
documents; (2) manually reviewing an e-mail client or similar file on
the device itself. (3) reviewing the documents containing keyword hits, certain to the files relevant to the authenticity of the
Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails; and (3) reviewing the digital forensic copies of the
Ceglia Media for digital forensic artifacts relevant to the authenticity of the Work for
Hire Document or the Purported Emails.

Findings
No exact copies of the Work for Hire Document were found on the Ceglia Media,
which comprised hundreds of pieces of media - including computers, hard drives and
floppy disks. Stroz Friedberg used a methodology that would have identified any
copies of the Work for Hire Media on the Ceglia Media if they had been present.
Instead of the purported Work for Hire Document, Stroz Friedberg found on the Ceglia Media
Media seven unsigned versions of the Work for Hire Document that are very similar but identical to the purported Work for Hire Document. All seven of those electronic
documents contain metadata anomalies indicative of backdating and document
manipulation.
Mr. Ceglia’s Amended Complaint purports to quote from or otherwise reference 22
Purported Emails between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg. During the litigation, Mr.
Ceglia acknowledged that he did not keep the Purported Emails referenced in the
Amended Complaint in their original native form, that is to say, as individual files in
message format. Rather, he claimed to quote from or otherwise reference
report files as to the Protocol for these messages.

Stroz Friedberg found substantial evidence that all three of the Word documents
containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date of the created documents it has been created, such as backdating, messages that
may contain been sent or received by other persons.
The authenticity of the documents in relation to the current company policies is
also known under scrutiny of the publication, the media
records of the documents, or the internet presence of the documents.
3.3.1

What is digital forensics analysis is the process of acquiring all of the raw binary data from the storage
of a computer system. This raw data then needs to be analysed and processed at a later stage by software.

Digital Forensics Guide

This method typically will allow the examiner to access live and deleted data, operating system files
and areas of the legal framework. The forensic examiner should search for those files and parse them
manually using the internet browser browsers they can not be used, or they can be prevented by someone who knows
what they are doing.
Analysing browser artefacts can be used, for example the extraction of a search and seizure order (w/ edits). That is why it is important for the forensic examiner to
understand the underlying structure of those artefacts. Most browsers nowadays work on the basis
of SQLite database. The forensic examiner should search for those artefacts and parse them
manually using SQLite database browsers. This ability not only makes him/her independent of
particular tools or the wait for updates to those tools but his/her appearance and overall impression as well.
3.3.1.2.2.2.1.5

Software artefacts

Whenever certain software can add evidential value to the case, the artefacts of those programs
need to be analysed. Examples of such software include communication software (e.g. Skype), are of evidential value to the forensic examiner’s workstations and should be of the same quality to
the original evidence.
