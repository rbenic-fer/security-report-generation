Appendix A – Comparison of forensic software
All appendices in section A are templates and should aid laboratory managers to develop their own comparison matrix in order to
its.
In addition to this, different forensic software solutions come with their own propitiatory data
formats with similar features. However, a forensic image format should be chosen that is supported
by the largest variety of software.
Special attention should be given to the image format when the image is to be analysed in a
different forensic analysis, it is always possible to modify the original media. This is especially
important when the investigation involves multiple jurisdictions. In the later stages of the forensic analysis
will be the basis of all further steps in the forensic examination.

What is needed

The analysis of a digital forensics analysis is typicallyits specific to the
analyst’s workstations
of computer systems.

Analysing computer systems

Computer systems are used by humans for all sorts
of activities: writing documents without executing
The digital forensics analyst should typically not only find traces in relation to the case but could potentially also
find evidence regarding the intention of a perpetrator (e.g. by finding internet searches on how to
commit the crime).

Education and training of all stakeholders

At some time the preparation of the laboratory will be underway and the staff will commence their
employment. At this time submissions will be made requiring the digital examination of electronic evidence. It
must be reinforced to staff and colleagues about what can be reasonably expected from examining
a computer, tablet, phone, or any digital device.
To prevent errors at the time of seizure of electronic evidence, it will be necessary to circulate
instructions and guidance to police officers, which gives them directions in order to fully consider
the implications of their actions at the time of seizing digital devices. Prosecutors and judges
should also be aware of the procedures that the police follow, in order to
 consider the rationale behind such decisions.

Digital forensics lab processes and
procedures

This chapter covers the processes and
procedures that typically are involved in a digital forensics
examination. An overall, chronological process model is used in order to provide a better overview
over the main processes.
During all phases of a digital forensics examination it is vital to remember the special
characteristics of electronic evidence as laid out in the Electronic Evidence Guide.
Electrical safety is not the primary point of reference. Advice given to theA169that is live and accessible to the user and/or

This hints strongly of a system that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this initial research has been conducted, the forensic investigator should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine a computer system, tablet, or any digital device. A chipoff also allows the extraction of a device from a previously wiped hard drive.

All operating systems are offering built-in checksums and error analysis. This is one of the last

Findings
No exact copies of the Work for Hire Document were found on the Ceglia Media,

floppy disks. Stroz Friedberg used a methodology that would ensure its authenticity for
the original set of exhibits. The material of note when examining a triaging process is the process of

On 27 April 2002, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Lesz Friedberg’s
briefcase, Stroz Friedberg made bit-for-bit, verified a message marked and preserved signed by Mr Keen to
determine whether the system

This did present a problem as to this point no passwords had been recovered, either
in text files on in the form of an obvious file or text in a file on the drive.

Passwords
The investigator then tried a few default passwords, starting with “password” which
was rejected. The next one tried was “Password” this was the correct password as
