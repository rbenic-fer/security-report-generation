user was getting frustrated with their slow and dated operating system that was
creaking under all the additional program running. These were drawn together in a
search for all text files, as the investigator looked for logs etc, notice again how the
numbers of log files and other text files modified and created comes to a grinding

If that hadn’t worked the cookies were the next stop. Oh and notice the dell cookie
on the 13 August 2004, it connects (time wise) to the Internet Firewall.
This prevents the device from altering any stored data. A number of
modern devices have the capacity to be remotely (and securely) wiped. Isolating the devices will
help to prevent this from happening.
Mobile devices are presented with three distinct media that require separate handling and
investigation techniques:


SIM / IDEN card or Serial NumberEN card or Serial No.



Memory Cards – Can be examined as a computer hard disk or flash drive.



Device’s Internal Memory – Requires specialist forensic tools and software.

The necessary forensic tools must be provided to the laboratory along with adequate hardware to
support acquisition of these devices and examination of the data.
At this stage, the logical acquisition of the SIM/IDEN card and physical acquisition of the memory
card should be undertaken. A physical examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This should
always be carried out prior to the examination of the device itself. The memory card should only be
returned to the device after it has been examined. This is due to some handsets having data stored
on the memory card and if the memory card is not present, this could cause data loss from the
handset. If time and resources allow, a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created and
that clone inserted into the handset. It is good practice that the SIM/IDEN card found in the device
should remain outside of the exhibit for the duration of the examination so as to isolate the device
from the mobile network. However, the majority of devices which contain SIM/IDEN card data require it
to be present within them when they are powered on or they are susceptible to data loss. To
combat this, a laboratory or cloned SIM/IDEN card found in the device in the past.

As suggested above, although there is no ability to discern the timecode that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to create a successful extraction. The application of specifically defined and tested procedures at the acquisition step is
crucial as there is an enormous scope for irreversible errors to be made. It is important to keep the
chain of custody intact at any stage, to document all steps carefully and to verify all images and
copies that were acquired.
The intangible nature of any data and information stored in electronic form makes it much easier to
manipulate and more prone to alteration than traditional forms of evidence. This has created
special challenges for the justice system, which requires that such data have to be handled in a
special way to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
Similar to other types of forensic evidence, the correct acquisition and handling of electronic
evidence are vital to the outcome of a case. Close attention must be paid to ensure that the
general guidelines are followed at all times:
Handling by specialists: Every kind of electronic device has its own specific
characteristics that require the correct and appropriate procedures must be applied. One
of the greatest risks is the unintentional modification of the evidence. Failure to adhere to
approved procedures is likely to lead to formal challenges in court about data integrity
that can undermine or invalidate the evidence.
Rapid evolution of electronic evidence sources: New technologies are invented and
develop very quickly. Consequently the procedures and techniques to be applied to them
also need to be constantly reviewed and updated.
Use of proper procedures, techniques and tools: As in more traditional forensic
disciplines, digital forensic specialists require special tools and knowledge to undertake
their investigations properly. It is imperative that the correct techniques and tools are
used for the situations encountered. The procedures must also be auditable and
repeatable by other specialists if the information obtained is to have evidential value.
Admissibility: Since the ultimate goal is to use evidence to prove or disprove disputed
facts, electronic evidence must be obtained in compliance with existing legislation and
best practice to ensure admissibility at trial.

Before even considering starting the acquisition process either the laboratory manager or the
exhibit officer must

maintain or lost through environmental
factors such as excessive heat or through the presence of electromagnetic
fields.

3.2.2

Processing of computer systems

Not only the number of computer systems per household and organisations, but also the amount of
storage in these computer systems is rising. Managing large amount of data while keeping the
backlog short is a big challenge for digital forensics laboratories. That is why different processing
approaching should be considered. It is why different processing
approaching should be considered. The first check should be of the order in which the
examiner should start and the order in which the text and files are to be analysed.
3.2.1.2.1.1.2.1

In order to analyse an e-mail client it is important to know which artefact that e-mail client
produces. Outlook for example stores evidential data in personal folder files such as PST, OST and
PAB files while Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files. The forensic software suites can usually
parse those files. However, they do not necessarily extract all messages. Some forensic tools, for
example, have problems extracting deleted messages from personal folder files.
3.2.2.1.2.2.2.2.2.1

Office documents

In cases in which office documents are of importance the digital forensics analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst

can search for further evidence of when those documents have been produced, by which user they
have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons.
3.3.1.2.1.3

Pictures / videos

Most forensics software solutions offer support for analysing masses of pictures and videos. After
an initial file signature analysis and setting a filter for pictures and video files, the forensics analyst
can use a gallery view to inspect the thumbnails of all pictures for case relevant evidence. For a
faster analysis of video files certain software offers the feature of extracting still pictures from the
videos (e.g. every X seconds/minutes depending on the settings). These extracted images can then
be viewed in a gallery view as well.
If the case requires searching for a set of known pictures (e.g. child abuse material or stolen
blueprints, etc), hash comparison can be used to accomplish this task. There are even techniques
available that enable searching for similar pictures with another hash value (fuzzy hashing,
similarity hashes, PhotoDNA, etc.).
In cases where location data or production details of pictures and video files are important the
analyst should consider extracting meta-data (e.g. exif data) for those files. In fact analysing meta
data and putting evidence into context in the major task for the forensic analyst in cases that
involve pictures or videos as evidence. The simple task of viewing the contents of the
pictures/videos does not require any digital forensic expertise and could thus be done by
responsible case investigator. Besides that the categorisation of images or further investigation
may be carried out by the investigating officer if facilities are supplied.
3.3.1.2.2.1.2.5

Internet browser

Internet browsers are of evidential value for a lot of cases. They typically contain the following
artefacts which need to be analysed:


Website visit history



Local cache / temporary internet files



Bookmarks / favorites
