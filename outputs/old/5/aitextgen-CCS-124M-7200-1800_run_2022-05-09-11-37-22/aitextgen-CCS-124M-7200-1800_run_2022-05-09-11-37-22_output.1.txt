This report is   “Overview of thumbnail pictures for comparison to the raw
video content of the comparison between the raw video content reveals that these videos were created on two occasions
with the same result. In addition to the “Full Footage Video” YouTube videos released by the Organization, edits made to these videos were applied
to eliminate non-pertinent footage, including “commuting,” “waiting,” “adjusting recording equipment,” “meals,” “restroom breaks,” “restroom breaks,” “restroom breaks,” “restroom breaks,” “meals,” “restroom breaks,”
footage consists of Investigator 1 and 2 driving in car to locations, or walking outside to locations outside to locations outside to locations outside a
building. The “restroom breaks,” lacking pertinent conversation. Any discrepancies in the chronology of the timecodes are consistent with the intentional removal of non-pertinent footage as described in this report.
Furthermore, four of the five raw video recordings, which also contained audio captured from the video recording
device, are accompanied by a raw audio-only recording captured from a separate audio-only recording device. The raw audioonly recordings last for the duration of their associated raw videos. These raw videos support the
completeness and authenticity of the raw video recordings since they depict the same events within the same duration
as captured from the two separate video recorders.

Evidence Acquisition Processing Procedures
Coalfire employed industry standard tools and techniques throughout handling, processing, and analysis of the
evidence. A sealed FedEx Express envelope was received into Coalfire Labs via FedEx Overnight delivery on September
17, 2015 at 8:35 AM (MST). A Chain of Custody was established upon opening the package. The package contained one
USB flash drive sealed in a FedEx label pouch. Details about the enclosed media are included below.

ScanDisk checked whether the raw video content of the files that are shown in the live files or the folders that are not in the live files on the Forensics
acquisition. This would mainly be if the raw video matches with the raw video content generated from the two separate video recording devices.
ScanDisk checked whether the raw video content of the folders that are shown in the live files on the original media or the folders that are
deemed to be identical or the folders of the same duration
as the folders in the path of the raw video.
ScanDisk checked whether the video files on the flash drive are shown in the table below.
ScanDisk checked if the raw video content reveals that many are “Full Footage” those that are not identical to the folders on the original media.

In large countries, it is possible to have individual staff knowledgeable and skilled in each of the
above disciplines. However in countries with a lower level of resources, it will be necessary to
examine how the available resources may be put to best effect. This may involve outsourcing some
activities or multi-skilling staff. This may involve outsourcing some

 order in order to analyse RAM is a

In some jurisdictions, the only level of examination is to be undertaken to
get the most data extracted out of the device. This is one of the deleted files on the floppy disk namely:

However, this is currently a valid method in order to provide a better overview
over the main processes. This prevents the device from altering any stored data. A number of
modern devices have the capacity to be remotely (and securely) wiped. Isolating the devices will
help to prevent this from happening.
Mobile devices are presented with three distinct media that require separate handling and
investigation techniques:



SIM / IDEN card

Appendix B – Exemplary device carrying case content

Appendix C – Acquisition process flow chart

Appendix F
====================
This report is  on one day/2014 which is live and accessible to the user’s actions
and aspirations for the additional types of crimes.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN card or memory card. This plan should include the possibility that some exhibits or data are not examined at all
(exclusive triage) or that some data (like IMEI) or from a website or in a locations reachable only to
commit the device. The second level of examination should be as follows:


If found in the analysis phase the examiner’s plan should be extremely shortened. Dec. Written reports should be handed up on occasions or before that is
possible, as well as feature-packed suites for the remainder of the report.
Contacts can include other communication channels, identity information as well as feature-packed suites for the
report and Chip-Off of these devices, it may be necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN devices are common.
At this stage, if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular to allow for the full timeline of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should
38

Digital Forensics Guide

attempt the best level of examination possible whilst bypassing the protection. If this is not
possible, the user’s PIN, password or pattern will be required prior to examination. If the PIN,
password or pattern is not known prior to examination, then the best level of examination should be undertaken to
the highest level of examination should be undertaken to the most data extracted out of the device. If obtaining the correct level of examination is
not possible it may be necessary to attempt typical PINs or patterns in order to access the data.
This is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one is found. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise the effect on the electronic evidence and to attempt to preserve
the integrity of the data to the highest standard possible. It is important to consider that for some
mobile devices it may be necessary to modify system files or the operating system, or in some
cases upload and install a dedicated application in order to successfully extract data from the
devices. This process can cause some data to be irrecoverably lost; this is normally only system
files with little to no evidential value. The knowledge of what should be considered
in the following stages:


How should the system fail?



Given the fact that the investigator was able to image the evidence onto a hard disk – this is a
examination of the forensic image
there should still be one lab in the available resources available to find.
In addition to this, a forensic image created by the investigator is of the Council of Europe Electronic Evidence Guide,
should allow for a different level of examination possible whilst bypassing the protection. If this is not
possible, the forensic image can be compiled and used. The knowledge of what should be considered
in all phases of a digital forensics analysis, it does not explain which features of a certain software
need to used or where exactly and in which format certain artefacts from all operating systems and
applications need to be parsed.
