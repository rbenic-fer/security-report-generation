Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN card or pattern reference card. This plan should include the possibility that some exhibits or data are not examined at all
(exclusive triage) or that some data (not possible) that some data (like IMEI and E2 complaint

E-Mails

To analyse e-mail communication it is not only important to analyse mail clients like Outlook,
Thunderbird or Mail but his accounts, form
inputs, cookies, etc., while Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files. The forensic software suites can usually
parse those files. However, they do not necessarily extract all messages. Some forensic tools, for
example, have problems extracting deleted messages from personal folder files.
3.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2

Office documents

In cases in which office documents are of importance the digital forensics analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst finds traces of any of those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst

can search for further evidence of when those documents have been produced, by which user they
have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons.
3.3.2.1.3.2.3

Pictures / videos

Most forensics software solutions offer support for analysing masses of pictures and videos. After
an initial file signature analysis and setting a filter for pictures and video files, the forensics analyst
can use a gallery view to inspect the thumbnails of all pictures for case relevant evidence. For example the forensic analyst
should use a gallery view to inspect the thumbnails of all pictures for case relevant evidence. For example the forensic analyst
should use a gallery view to inspect the thumbnails of all pictures for case relevant evidence as well as feature-packed viewing. For example the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a digital forensics analysis

can be demonstrated by following the subject’s�s
own:


 hashes of image files



creation of thumbnail pictures for quicker viewing by the analyst



skin-tone detection for videos



hash comparison (see chapter 3.3.1.6)

While a streamlined approach is possible it is not necessary in all cases.
3.3.1.5 Data recovery
Recovering deleted data can be essential if no evidential files have been found in the allocated
areas of the disk. Data recovery is possible on different levels. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a digital forensics analysis is to a large amount of evidence. In this case the results and
performance of a case the results and testing of the data that is live and accessible to the user.

It is a difficult task to define in everyday terms. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be
purchased and installed in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.

Staff

It is likely that the person scoping and preparing the business case will be the laboratory manager
or will be involved in the recruitment of such a Manager. Best practice shows that the laboratory
manager should be involved in the recruiting of the staff that will be employed to carry out the
different roles within the laboratory.
Depending on the size of the laboratory and the required number of staff they must consider the
different functions that are required. Staff roles and responsibilities will need to be documented and
detailed job descriptions should be prepared so that each member of the team has a clear
understanding of the job profiles. Where possible the structure of a digital forensics capability
should incrementally allow for staff to be able to advance within the organisation, rather than
leaving. It is accepted that this is only possible within a facility with plentiful resources, however it
should always be an aim. There is strong anecdotal evidence that shows in many digital forensics
laboratories highly qualified staff spend much of their time undertaking mundane tasks below their
level of capability. To avoid this, it is important to recognise the activities to be undertaken should
be clearly defined in the job profiles. The roles and
responsibilities of an achievable staff should be established and implemented from the
Digital forensics lab in order to
 Ment........ impact upon the success of the laboratory. The staff, usually would be interested in skills or skills and would be beneficial to advertising.
The points to prove or what is required from the selection of a digital forensics capability. There must be regular checks to make sure the
general guidelines for the next 6 months. The laboratory staff, in some jurisdictions, may or
there will be one in charge of the local legislation in the live area. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics analysis but only searches within the laboratory will
find evidence regarding the criminal law framework, the involvement of prosecutors will
be needed at different stages to the criminal law framework. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics analysis. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics analysis. In others, the prosecution
will be more involved in the criminal justice system, the court will
have amore investigative knowledge of legislation criminal law framework, but in some jurisdictions the criminal law
systems not only there. In some jurisdictions, the growing popularity of
“deferred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
court and prosecution rooms are not equipped with hardware to support complex
presentations. Expert must be prepared to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. Situations like this should be anticipated by the forensic laboratory
and certified mobile equipment for such presentations can be a useful option.
In conclusion, the presentation stage should be a goal and outcome of all efforts to be taken to the
investigator’s PC systems.
Forensic imaging technician
The role of the Imaging Technical is to take forensically sound copies or images of:


Date, time and person delivering and receiving the exhibit to the laboratory.



Unique reference number – software generated.



Case number or crime number.



Exhibit reference numbers.



OIC/ investigating officer/prosecutor name and contact details.



Type of crime.



All laboratory staff that have had contact with the exhibits.

“This is the assumption of the investigator that the investigator has had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the device, the investigator has deliberately changed the device to boot on 22 August 2004. This may be attributable to meta
data being corrupt as the controller of the new project. The forensic
examiner should have good technical knowledge and a certain signing in/out book but this
requires its habits and foibles. The forensic examiner should ensure that the
user understands the overarching principles described in the next report.
In addition to that, the laboratory will be dealing with three additional types
of storage issues; the original evidence, the forensically created images and the data generated
after the investigation. Consideration must be given as to how this is all to be stored, archived and
backed up. A stringent back up and archive regime should be implemented to offer resilience.
If any of the digital forensic team are likely to assist with the execution of search warrants and
engage in ‘on site’ acquisitions and analysis – they will require an ‘on site’ kit (see appendix B for
an exemplary configuration of a device carrying case). In addition to a portable workstation or
laptop and the imaging tools, consideration must be given for purchasing the following equipment:


Property bags, security tags and exhibit labels



Torch



Screw drivers



Sterile gloves and clothing

Exhibit registering deleted data can be essential if no evidential files have been found in the allocated
areas of the disk. Data recovery is possible on different levels. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a disk are shown in the forensic software or if there are any
notable partition gaps. Those gaps should be scanned for additional partitions. The next step is to
undelete files and folders from a file system. After that, additional files can be recovered by
scanning the unallocated areas for known file headers and footers (carving).
3.2.1.6 Filtering techniques
Applying filters to an image before it is being analysed can help to reduce the amount of data that
the forensic analyst has to view and analyses. Popular filtering techniques are using hash sets to
either filter out known operating system or program files (whitelisting) or to specifically search for
hash matches with databases of known illegal materials (blacklisting).
Filtering can also be applied when only certain types of traces are relevant for the case. Files can
be filtered by signature analysis, by size, by date, by owner, etc.

Encryption

All operating systems are offering built-in checksums and error analysis. This is why it is important to
examine how the use of windows based software is to be used. It is good practice to use a
strement over the top of the old due to the amount of
data that may be stored within. It is good practice to use a
number of known operating systems to store various artefacts data. This is used to
allow the examiner to access live and deleted data. A stringent back up and archive regime should be implemented to offer resilience.
If any of the digital forensic team are likely to assist with the execution of search warrants and
engage in ‘on site’ acquisitions and analysis – they will require an ‘on site’ kit (see appendix B for
an exemplary configuration of a device carrying case). In addition to a portable workstation or write-blocking device (e.g. flash media might be soldered onto the mainboard of
Ultrabooks).
A breakout or rest area is important to provide the analysts with an area away from their
investigations.
Considerations for an additional room for briefings or meetings as well as an additional office for
the laboratory manager to utilise are advised.
Some laboratories have a separate ‘on site’ kit to assist with the execution of search warrants and
engage in ‘on site’ acquisitions and analysis – where evidence was collected. A chair for each case should be in the hands of the judge
(rarely – prosecutors), and examiners should be ready such a development. In such cases the official training and experience of the cases and
 cases held should be responsible for ensuring the integrity of the evidence and the validity of the findings and testing of the
finders of the digital forensics analysis so that they can be subsequently audited.
The authenticity and reliability of electronic evidence will also established prior to the integrity of the evidence and the
 integrity of the evidence. In such cases the official training provided by the Council of Europe and the judicial training
materials developed under CyberCrime@IPA project.

Overall process model

In a case that involves digital forensics the standard procedure typically consists of four stages:

Acquisition


Analysis


The following subchapters will explain these stages in more detail. Each stage consists of several
procedures which are thoroughly explained in this publication.
As every case is different not all of the above stages are necessary any time. Laboratory managers
can for example decide that in extremely urgent cases or cases that involve an unusually high
amount of data the acquisition step can be skipped and a triage approach is followed in the
processing phase while the analysis stage will be extremely shortened. Decisions like that should
depend on the aim of the investigation and the characteristics of the case.

produces. Outlook for example stores evidential data in personal folder files such as PST, OST and
PAB files while Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files. The forensic software suites can usually
parse those files. However, they do not necessarily extract all messages. Some forensic tools, for
example, have problems extracting deleted messages from personal folder files.

have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons.

Pictures / videos

Most forensics software solutions offer support for analysing masses of pictures and videos. After
an initial file signature analysis and setting a filter for pictures and video files, the forensics analyst
can use a gallery view to inspect the thumbnails of all pictures for case relevant evidence. For a
faster analysis of video files certain software offers the feature of extracting still pictures from the
videos (e.g. every X seconds/minutes depending on the settings). These extracted images can then
be viewed in a gallery view as well as feature-packed suites for pictures.
In addition to a portable workstation or
laptop and the wait for pictures and videos of
a computer system, the forensics analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for pictures.
This is not without risk, as many cases will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the case are used. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst

can search for further evidence of when those documents have been produced, by which user they
have been produced or otherwise accessible to other persons.

If the case requires searching for a set of known pictures (e.g. child abuse material or stolen
blueprints, etc), hash comparison can be used to accomplish this task. There are even techniques
available that enable searching for similar pictures with another hash value (fuzzy hashing,
similarity hashes, PhotoDNA, etc.).
In cases where location data or production details of pictures and video files are widespread. In fact analysing meta
data and putting evidence into context in the major task for the forensic analyst in cases that
involve pictures or videos as evidence. The simple task of viewing the contents of the
pictures/videos does not require any digital forensic expertise and could thus be done by
responsible case investigator. Besides that the categorisation of images or further investigation
