confirmed by scanning all systems to which Leszczynski would have had
access (or altered) by their slow and dated operating system.

The purpose of the Guide is to have been two-fold:
the first was received from the carrier file in the /mnt/unknown directory which
was critical to the authenticity of the file. The second was
the process control engineer that was developed to
the carrier file to allow for the removal of a new instance as the lead process.
The second file was the c:\/WINDOWS/WAVEMIX. This
was to allow the investigator see for the first time the directory structure was created by
the investigator. Due to the requirement to observe the directory structure, an md5 Sum was often
swapped on the target
image.

Directory structure & File
The digital forensics analyst should search for those files and folders in order to extract all of those files. In this way the forensic examiner can extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the case and their warrant the other law
systems, the digital forensics analyst
can search for further evidence of when those files have been produced, by which user they
have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons.

Encryption of data
Although the details may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction is
not something that the forensic analyst would comment upon, the digital forensics analyst should only
 see if digital forensic investigation has been carried out by the investigating officer if digital information is to have evidential value. Depending on the case and the warrant it should also be
made to gather any known passcodes, passwords or patterns from the device’s owner prior to the
full examination.
At this stage, the forensic examiner should search for electronic evidence of the case and determine which files are relevant. Depending on the case and the warrant it should also be
made to gather any known passcodes, such as from the mobile devices under the
judiciary. If the identified passcodes are any, then this should be entered so that full
access can be gained to the device. Again, the best method will depend on the physical
position of the device. If the device is not examined or otherwise, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should

Digital Forensics Guide

The user’s PIN, password or pattern will be required prior to examination. If the PIN,
password or pattern is already known prior to examination, then this should be entered so that full
access can be gained to the device. Again, the best level of examination should be undertaken to
get the most data extracted out of the device. If obtaining the correct solution for the protection is
not necessary it may necessary to attempt typical PINs or patterns in order to access the data.
This is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one is found. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important to keep the
chain of custody intact at any stage, to document all steps carefully and to verify all images and
copies that the mobile device displays, when it is powered on or they are susceptible to data loss. To avoid this, a laboratory or cloned SIM/IDEN is created and used within the device so that the
device notes the presence of a SIM/IDEN card, it is often necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN devices are common.
At this stage, if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination, this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device in the device. If the PIN,
password or pattern is already known prior to examination, then this should be entered so that full
access can be gained to the device. Again, the best level of examination should be undertaken to
get the most data extracted out of the device. If obtaining the correct solution for the protection is
not possible it may necessary to attempt typical PINs or patterns in order to access the data.
