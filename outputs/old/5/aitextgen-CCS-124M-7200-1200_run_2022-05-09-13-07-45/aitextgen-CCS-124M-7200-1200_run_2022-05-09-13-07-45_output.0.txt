Digital Forensics Analysis Report
Overview / Case Summary
On April 11, 2011, Paul Ceglia filed an Amended
Complaint seeking a share of
Facebook. Mr. Ceglia based his claim on a purported contract between Mr. Ceglia and
Mark Zuckerberg (the “Work for Hire Document”). In addition, the Amended
Complaint included excerpts of purported emails between Mr. Ceglia and Mr.
Zuckerberg (the “Purported Emails”).

Objectives
This report is a summary of Stroz Friedberg’s findings regarding the authenticity of the
Work for Hire Document and the Purported Emails based on its analysis of the media
produced by Mr. Ceglia pursuant to data received as part of expedited discovery. This
report is not intended to detail each and every aspect of Stroz Friedberg’s work in this
engagement.

Evidence Analyzed
Pursuant to the Court Order, Stroz Friedberg collected digital media made available by
Mr. Ceglia. Stroz Friedberg inspected the data on the following media for analysis
according to the terms of the Court-ordered Protocol:
A Compaq Presario SR5413WM desktop computer with a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
An eMachines ET1161-05 desktop computer with a 160 gigabyte hard drive.
A 200 gigabyte Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 external hard drive.
A 500 gigabyte Western Digital internal hard drive.
174 floppy disks.

Using widely-accepted digital forensic techniques and procedures, digital forensic
personnel from Stroz Friedberg made bit-for-bit, verified forensic copies or images of:
the hard drive within the Compaq Presario desktop computer; the hard drive within the
eMachines desktop computer; the Maxtor external hard drive; the Seagate Hard Drive; and 173 of the 174
floppy disks.
The digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of each piece of
media, including the active user-accessible files, the deleted files, and the unallocated
space, which may contain deleted content. Because the forensic image created by
Plaintiff’s Expert is a forensic image file, Stroz Friedberg used a forensically-sound copy
method to copy the forensic image file on that drive to preservation media.

Investigation Steps
Stroz Friedberg conducted its analysis of the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia Media “to
identify only documents, data, fragments, and artifacts that reasonably appear[ed] to
be related to the authenticity of the [Work for Hire] attached to the
Amended Complaint and the [P]urported [E]mails described in the Amended
Complaint.”. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Stroz Friedberg
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg has followed the terms of the Protocol for all data found on the Ceglia
Media and any other data subject to the Protocol during its analysis, including the
procedures for privilege review and production set forth above and the maintenance of
a search log.

During this analysis, Stroz Friedberg employed a methodology tailored to the particular
facts of this case. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included: (1) conducting keyword and
other searches of the digital forensic copies of the Ceglia Media and other data,
including webmail accounts, to identify responsive documents or fragments of
documents; (2) manually reviewing the documents containing keyword hits, certain
unsearchable file types, such as image files with no text, and other documents to
determine whether they were relevant to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails; and (3) reviewing the

Having started the imaging process, the output was
checked and listed as a key reference document document,
indicating file activity and user actions traced. The user was relatively new and familiar with
what this object is. The key factors in the examination of the data due to the wildly
varying hardware and software versions of a digital forensics capability

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the output analysed drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.
Key factors should be considered in Appendix Gd’s technical

These resources can assist in building a robust list of useful resources allow, a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created in the device. It is also worth considering any
somewhat unusual timings/mayisions about the memory card. It is also worth noting, if a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created and
that clone inserted into the handset. It is a
Steganographic Program that hides the inside of the handset itself. It is a
Steganographic Program that hides the inside of the handset to allow for the acquisition process. This
matched the device will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on. It is a legal challenge since the ultimate goal of a digital forensics examination is to produce a full access to the
mobile forensic laboratory, a room with access to the laboratory manager to allow for the acquisition process. The
Electronic imaging formats can also be used to ascertain the requirements of the digital forensic laboratory as
to how they are relevant to the acquisition process.
Therefore, it is worth noting that this is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one is found. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise the effect on the electronic evidence and to attempt to preserve
the integrity of the data to the highest standard possible. It is important to consider that for some
mobile devices it may be necessary to modify system files or the operating system, or in some
cases upload and install a dedicated application in order to successfully extract data from the
devices. The process will need to be in place to attempt to extract data from the

files with little to no evidential value. The knowledge of what is altered by any of these processes
can be demonstrated by holding appropriate training certifications, such as training provided by the
manufacturers of mobile forensics software, or practical experience involving the testing of what
data, if any, on the device is altered by making these system changes.
3.2.2.2.5 Hardware and software
Analysis of mobile devices typically requires the use of dedicated software and the correct cable.
Some additional, dedicated tools will include stand-alone extraction tools. More advanced
examination techniques, such as JTAG or Chip-Off will require further tools, including soldering
equipment and specialist jigs to read raw data from the device’s memory chips.
