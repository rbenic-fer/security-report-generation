Summary of events and supposition by the investigator

©

The following is the summary of the events; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
stemmed from the lack of basic internet security devices ie a Firewall and AntiVirus
(although from this investigation not even Norton could have helped him). The user
elected to install several ‘free’ internet accelerators and dubious software touting to
be popup stoppers etc.
The installation of several peer-to-peer program facilitated the increase in

downloaded software of dubious sources and the volume of pornography installed
on the system hints to broadband being installed – there is a reference to NTL
broadband medic in the unallocated space but much of this data is corrupt. The
user seems to have become aware of the Spyware as a popup blocker is installed
and a few weeks later the installation of Spyware-blocker is seemingly started,
however possibly due to so many files being infected and corrupted or hardware
failure, the system crashed during the install and despite attempts over several days
the system is never again operational.

It was noted that the user had considered purchasing a new machine as several
references to Dell <www.dell.co.uk> were seen in the cache and the Internet
Explorer history points to the commencement or at least pricing of a Dell
Dimension 2400.

When the system finally fails to boot on 22 August 2004 the user makes the
decision to dispose of it. They remove the memory and, judging by the software
and media players installed (one from X-Men2 and Nero Burning Burning Burning Burning Burning ROM), a
DVDR/CDRW 51/2” device (see the images at the start). Then either believing that
no data can be recovered or not knowing about data forensics, the case is then
dumped at the local refuse facility, where the investigator spots it the next day.

believing the disk to be corrupt elects to scrap the system some time over the next
week.

The BIOS clock on the BIOS clock is expected to end in
the hands of either the user of
the system or the user of the system (upon boot), on 11 Aug 2004 then over the next 11 days a further 23
scans were imitated. This would indicate a failing of either the physical disk, the
operating system or the presence of some software that was causing the system to
crash, whereupon reboot a scandisk would automatically be invoked (and
conducted unless cancelled by the user).

The program found on the disk went by the name of Camouflage. It is a
Steganographic Program that hides user selected data inside carrier files. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
attention. For additional
security you can password your camouflaged file. This password will be
required when extracting the files within. You can even camouflage files
within camouflaged files. Camouflage was written for use with Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows NT and Windows 2000, and is simple
to install and use.”
