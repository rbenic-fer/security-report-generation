Summary of events and supposition by the investigator

Digital forensics lab processes and

The following is the summary of the events; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
stemmed from the lack of basic internet security devices ie a Firewall and AntiVirus
(although from this investigation not even Norton could have helped him). The user
elected to install several ‘free’ internet accelerators and dubious software touting to
be popup stoppers etc.
The installation of several peer-to-peer program facilitated the increase in

downloaded software of dubious sources and the volume of pornography installed
on the system hints to broadband being installed – there is a reference to NTL
broadband medic in the unallocated space but much of this data is corrupt. The
user seems to have become aware of the Spyware as a popup blocker is installed
and a few weeks later the installation of Spyware-blocker is seemingly started,
however possibly due to so many files being infected and corrupted or hardware
failure, the system crashed during the install and despite attempts over several days
the system is never again operational.

It was noted that the user had considered purchasing a new machine as several
references to Dell <www.dell.co.uk> were seen in the cache and the Internet

This system was an easy target for Malware and viruses as it had everything going
for it; no antivirus software, no firewall, numerous peer-to-peer applications and
several browser hijacking programs (and an uneducated user unless the user was
creaking). The system lasted
just under 9 months but given the sites and user activity it did well to last that long,
especially as much of the problem was user installed under a social engineering
attack aimed to trick them to thinking they would fit their problems.
Personal Statement:

====================
This report is........................................................................ signed and months after Mr. Ceglia filed this lawsuit.

Conclusion
Stroz Friedberg found direct and compelling digital forensic evidence that the
documents relied upon by Mr. Ceglia pursuant to data received as part of expedited discovery. This
report is not intended to detail each and every aspect of Stroz Friedberg’s work in this
engagement.

Evidence Analyzed
Pursuant to the Court Order, Stroz Friedberg collected digital media made available by
Mr. Ceglia. Stroz Friedberg inspected the data on the following media for analysis
according to the terms of the Court-ordered Protocol:
A Compaq Presario SR5413WM desktop computer with a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
An eMachines ET1161-05 desktop computer with a 160 gigabyte hard drive.
A 200 gigabyte Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 external hard drive.
A 500 gigabyte Western Digital internal hard drive.
174 floppy disks.

https://www.cybersleuthlab.org

1.504.608.5766

info@ cybersleuthlab.org

Using widely-accepted digital forensic techniques and procedures, digital forensic
personnel from Stroz Friedberg made bit-for-bit, verified forensic copies or images of:
the hard drive within the Compaq Presario desktop computer; the hard drive within the
eMachines desktop computer; the Maxtor external hard drive; the Seagate Hard Drive; and 173 of the 174
floppy disks.
The digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of each piece of
media, including the active user-accessible files, the deleted files, and the unallocated
space, which may contain deleted content. Because the forensic image created by
Plaintiff’s Expert is a forensic image file, Stroz Friedberg used a forensically-sound copy
method to copy the forensic image file on that drive to preservation media.

Investigation Steps
Stroz Friedberg conducted its analysis of the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia Media “to
identify only documents, data, fragments, and artifacts that reasonably appear[ed] to
be related to the authenticity of the [Work for Hire] attached to the
Amended Complaint] attached to the
Amended Complaint and the [P]urported [E]mails described in the Amended
Complaint.”. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Stroz Friedberg
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr. or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg has followed the terms of the Protocol for all data found on the Ceglia
Media and any other data subject to the Protocol during its analysis, including the
procedures for privilege review and production set forth above and the maintenance of
a search log.

During this analysis, Stroz Friedberg employed a methodology tailored to the particular
facts of this case. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included: (1) conducting keyword and
other searches of the digital forensic copies of the Ceglia Media and other data,
including webmail accounts, to identify responsive documents or fragments of
documents; (2) manually reviewing the documents containing keyword hits, certain
unsearchable file types, such as image files to no text, and other documents to
determine whether they were relevant to the authenticity of the Work for Hire

Document or the Purported Emails; and (3) reviewing the digital forensic copies of the
Ceglia Media for digital forensic artifacts relevant to the authenticity of the Work for
Hire
Document or the Purported Emails.

Findings
No exact copies of the Work for Hire Document were found on the Ceglia Media,
which comprised hundreds of pieces of media - including computers, hard drives and
floppy disks. Stroz Friedberg used a methodology that would have identified any
copies of the Work for Hire Document on the Ceglia Media

3.4.1.2.2.3

Call logs unreliable. It is often best practice to obtain
billing information from a mobile service provider to confirm time and date information for call
records. This time stamp is obtained from the mobile service provider’s servers and so can be
considered accurate (or rather it is more likely to be accurate).
3.4.2.5

Application artifacts

Due to the amount of different applications and the multitude of application versions that are
available, it is often necessary to analyse different artifacts unique to different applications. Many
of these applications will, for example, store settings in database files. It may be the case that
deleted database files are recovered and these can be used to ascertain the settings of an
application at a given point in the past. Due to the closed nature of many applications and the lack
of available information, it often often necessary to obtain a test device and obtain a test device and conduct some live
research in order to identify the properties of some application artifacts.

default Mail applications and through web mail accessed through the internet browser. On some
devices, such as newer Apple iPhones, the extraction of email messages from the default Mail
application is not supported. In these cases the examiner will have to manually record the data or
attempt to gather this data from other sources.

Prosecutor's considerations
The interpretation of the evidence submitted or analysis stage is of the vital importance of the staff and staff involved in the
examination of this Guide.
Often evidence will be present in great numbers and their bulleting and listing can be
time consuming. Nevertheless, one must be persistent in this process having in mind
that this approach will lead to a logical explanation of the chain of evidence and the validity of the findings.
The interpretation of the evidence must be taken very seriously and its importance well
understood. Forensic staff must be aware they will be summoned by the court and be in
a position to explain their procedures and findings in detail; their statements will be
examined both by the prosecution and defence, and, depending on the system, by the
judiciary. This situation can be of crucial importance for the success or failure of the
case and it must be taken seriously.
The analysis of the evidence should lead to clear and logical conclusions which should be
able to sustain significant examination during the trial.

3.5

Presentation stage

After evidence has been found in the analysis stage, the examiner needs to create a report for the
trial. The examiner’s job is to illustrate and to translate complicated technical contexts into facts
that judges, prosecutors and other parties involved can easily understand. They may also be
expected to interpret those facts and to express an opinion on their meaning.

3.5.1.2.5

Admissibility of electronic evidence
Although the details may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it is surmised that electronic
evidence should not be regarded as a legal expert
position under Section 2 of the Civil Procedure Act 1959 & 64 (formerly an ‘Anton Piller Order’ after the case of the same name), the
prosecution may or not be an expert. In this
case, a more favourable or desired perspective, by the Court-ordered Protocol should not be accessible to the untrained eye of
steps.
Te expert witness status will vary from country to country.
Therefore, a more favourable or desired perspective would be drawn in all respect of the public and
all, more fully of a look at the courts and places to explain in court. Stroz Friedberg made the following findings bearing in place:
