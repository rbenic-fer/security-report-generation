Key areas and direction for Floppy Disk

Background

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis submitted or analysis was to have
undertaken from the contents of the incident. The disk, identified in item(s)

The forensic workstation image was re-ghosted to the laptop and all respective
security and reliability patches applied. The workstation used was a Dell [Dell]
Inspiron 5100 with removable hard disk caddies containing:

been connected to the internet; thus they can be judged to be forensically and
operationally sound in that they will represent accurately all data they process and
display. The image of the laptop has been retained for future use and reference
should it be required.

It is not possible to state if Mr RJ Leszczynski had transferred data out of the
organisation on occasions or if this was the first attempt, however, examination of

The Software found and possibly used by Leszczynski

©

The program found on the disk went by the name of Camouflage. It is a
Steganographic Program that hides user selected data inside carrier files. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
attention of your choice. This password will be
required when extracting the files within. You can even camouflage files
within camouflaged files. Camouflage was written for use with Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows NT and Windows 2000, and is simple
to install and use.”

An attempt to recreate the image made by Mr R J Leszczynski failed in that the md5
hashes of the output file are not the same. That said it is unlikely that they would as
the files would be different given the different MAC times that would accompany the
files that are inserted, see below:

Post Incident Activities
Given the severity of the incident the following activities are recommended to by
undertaken in priority order:

Impound Mr R J Leszczynski’s PC and any other system on which he
had unfettered access (without powering it on) and have it Forensically

Analysed. The hashes from items 13, 16 and 23 should be searched for on
the imaged drives (having performed a deep or recursive hash of all files on
his HDD; this will confirm or otherwise the presence of pre or post
camouflaged files. However, the accuracy of the
Work for Hire Document and the Purported Emails based on its analysis of the media

Not particularly of a problem; occasionally the user where traces would search for
