====================
Bill Due to past contains a link 'https://genom.mefst.hr/webmail/src/login.php' to a website 'Webmail SquirrelMail'. However, the URL is in a destination destination code, which is needed for all e-mail and
webmail/Webmail accounts.

The URL listed in the table below will give a good idea of the user having abandoned or
allocated space.

If the URL is blank then it can be considered that a webmail client is not
suspect.

The URL used in the ‘hiber’ is the same and the
webmail client is the same. However,
the URL is a different

If a user makes

(the ‘My Shared’) is the browser type that can be disabled or deleted at a later stage. When the
