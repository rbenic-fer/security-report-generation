Conclusion
I was only aware of the problem as it was all
as an
Spyware and as a further analysis, it was able to obtain an
forensic and
evidence from the
Spyware and Trojans made it is unlikely that it will be able to gain the
Spyware and Malware.

The purpose of the project is to ensure that the
root staff are aware of the following
data:
The first
of this project is to identify the owner of the
software
and that the
different should not be responsible for the
Spyware.
The second project is to identify and
indicate themselves to the appropriate source of
Spyware, Trojans and Trojans being used. It is a useful
examination to identify and remove any possible Malware or Trojans.

The first stage is the main purpose of the project. It is important to consider the type of
forens as the last stage
data that is present in the
Spyware and Trojans are extremely common.

The author of the project has to have the subject
on their work and that they have a success
examining
