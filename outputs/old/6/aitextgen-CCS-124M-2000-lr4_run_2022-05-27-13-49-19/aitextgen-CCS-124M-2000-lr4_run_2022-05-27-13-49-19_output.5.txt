In summary Mr R J Leszczynski has beached the company policy on Information
Sensitivity, and given it was on the disk with which he caused the breach, he cannot
argue that he was not aware of it either (double whammy!). It would be for the
civilian court process to decide on the level of damages that could be awarded
following a successful case, but before that is undertaken the search and seizure of
the media at Mr R J Leszczynski’s private address should be undertaken to ensure
that data is returned to the data owner and that the full extent of his activities are
declared to the courts.

Report writing is the branch of forensic science that focuses on identifying, acquiring, acquiring,
analysing and presenting digital forensic evidence.
Each and every branch of Digital Forensics requires extensive training and experience making it
impossible to expert witness. A software database is created by anforensic Digital Forensics Guide and then the software database is used to. The information stored in that are remotely
available should be at a very high levels. The forensic analyst should conduct a well
great lot of computer forensic training to crossreference and some data over the top level. This can be in breach of good
practice and the training of the staff, the staff and the staff that will carry out the
investigator.
Prosecutor’s considerations
Punctuation and Presentation
The digital forensic analysts can easily understand or they will need to because of everyday
routines. Ideally a list of useful resources is found in the Electronic Evidence Guide.
Readers should have a good time line of legislation which, at a first glance, is likely
thoroughly as the aim of the case.
Readers should ensure that they are fully conversant with the laws of their own countries related to
the digital forensics process and the admissibility of evidence adduced therefrom. National law
should always be the primary point of reference. Advice given in the Guide is not expected or
intended to contradict any national legislation and is at all times subject to national laws, rules and
procedures.

contemporary training is important for the digital forensics analysts, and it is important to be confident in the

The role of prosecutors in a contemporary digital forensics laboratory is to take
them from the initial acquisition and testing of the
technical processes.ouflately these staff
members will require specific training to bring them up to a suitable skill level. Digital
forensic analysts must have knowledge of legislation and be aware of the points to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.

Forensic imaging technician
The role of the Imaging Technical is to take forensically sound copies (images) of computer hard
drives and other storage media. Depending on the size of the laboratory, several technicians may
be required. The Forensic Imaging Technician will need to have good technical knowledge and an
understanding of the various methods of forensically acquiring digital data. A key skill requirement
is attention to detail and the ability to clearly document all their actions, the verification of imaged
data and the continuity of evidence.
Administration
An important role within any laboratory is continuity of the evidence and requisite recording of the
chain of custody. Depending on the size of the laboratory and the amount of electronic evidence to
be examined, an administrator role may need to be filled. The administrator would take
responsibility for documenting each new case, checking all cases and
case exhibits to identify which features of the original evidence.
Administwindowsation of extracted evidence and established facts represents the final stage and
goal of the whole process.

Alternative presentation methods

Some forensic tools are available that can’t be solved due to built-in checksums and
case staff seeking to crosscheck the text on the original medium. This is due to some handsets having data stored
on a hard drive or some other type of media. This is due to some handsets having data stored
on a hard drive or a hard drive. It is good practise to have some form of record of entry and
manipulation and as the evidence is to be completed, this could be demonstrated by holding
aallowing in case the need arises. The forensic analysts should be aware of this and, when in doubt, consult with the authority leading the
investigator to the facts.
Once the evidence has been completed, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the technical investigation.

Internet browser

Internet browsers are of evidential value for a lot of cases. They typically contain the following
artefacts which need to be analysed:


Website visit history



Local cache / temporary internet files



Cookies



Sessions information



Internet searches

Analysing browser artefacts can be important for suggesting purpose or intent (e.g. keywords used
in search engines could prove intent). That is why those artefacts should be analysed in most
cases.

48

Digital Forensics Guide

The most popular browsers are Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer / Edge, Mozilla Firefox
and Apple Safari. All of them store their data in all operating systems within the user home
directory. Except for the Microsoft browsers they all use SQLite databases to store the artefacts
mentioned above.
Even though most forensic software can parse these browser artefacts to some extent, they differ
quite a lot in a) which versions of the browsers they can parse and b) which detail of information
they can extract from each browser artefact. This is why those artefacts should be analysed in most
cases.

make these artefacts more relevant to the forensic analyst. Most browsers nowadays work on the basis
of those tools. Those that require searching for those artefacts can be done by searching for those artefacts. The
Web site needs to be where most forensic software can find its hands on
the cookies. This can be done by searching for those artefacts and comparing them toCASE host site. This can help
the analyst make a decision in regards to a certain extent, e.g. from a search of the searches that host site a search
record can find in search browsers can be listed.

In the opinion of the expert,  Experts and support staff. In some jurisdictions, expert status is decided on each and every case by the trial judge and
the person is only an expert in that case. In other jurisdictions, expert status has a more long
lasting status, by virtue of appointment as, for example a court expert.3
Evidence involving complex issues of science and technology plays an increasing role in litigation. 4
The rights and duties of an expert witness typically differ from country to country. It is important
for the digital forensics analysts to make themselves familiar with their legislation, their court
procedures, their role and their rights and duties in that role.

3.4

Alternative presentation methods

Some courts allow the usage of alternative presentation methods. Those can include explanatory
media such as live demonstrations on computers with projectors, virtual machines, etc. If wanted,
accepted and necessary, it is vital to discuss those possibilities with the judge before the hearing.
It is also very important to be confident in the usage of those techniques and to have tested them
before the hearing.
