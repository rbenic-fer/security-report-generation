3.2.1

Admissibility of electronic evidence

In a busy digital forensics laboratory it is important to have a data retention policy in place. If this
is not implemented and followed from the beginning, a situation may quickly arise where there is
insufficient storage available at the laboratory to hold the data. This may be in breach of good
practice and the laboratory may be breaching local data protection legislation. Once implemented
there should be regular checks to make sure the laboratory is still compliant. In some jurisdictions
there are legal requirements for the retention of data, particularly in serious cases. Any such
requirements should be at the forefront of any policy.

E-mail messages

As with computer-based examinations, digital forensic laboratories are often fast paced. When dealing with serious criminal
investigations it is common that time pressures are encountered as investigators will

examine and consider the following areas:

A triage process is typically conducted by booting up several exhibits at the same time using a
forensic boot medium. The medium should ideally be configured to run several pre-defined tasks
(only the forensic laboratory should observe the process of booting up several exhibits at the same time).
In cases where the forensic analysts will need to observe the individual image file they are
boot to. This can often be solved by holding
attention of the original image files and triage which, at a later stages, do not
accepted. The forensic analyst should should concentrate on the relevant artefacts to prove this forensic
examination.

3.2.1.4

Retention of data

In cases where the forensic analysts finds traces of a computer system they might not only be aware of the
computer of the relevant resources but also the amount of
trainings to be considered. Those factors include:
the amount of storage media to be analysed, the size of the storage media, the complexity of the
file systems being used, the level of usage of the operating system, the sophistication of the user,
complexity of software and techniques being used by the computer user, etc.
