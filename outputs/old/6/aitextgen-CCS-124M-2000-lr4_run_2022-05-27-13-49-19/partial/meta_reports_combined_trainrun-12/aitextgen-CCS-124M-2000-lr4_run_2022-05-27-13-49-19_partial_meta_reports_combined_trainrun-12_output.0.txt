The creation of a recovered Disk disk did not help but show a disk
allocated in the disk. Although, the disk had been left with a different
UK file that was not normally stored
on the disk. The disk was, in a later stage, a bit-for-bit copy of the
forensics analyst in a further investigation revealed that the disk had been left there
to the disk technically time and the hard disk was either stored in a
acquganographic state where no disk was in the cloud.
The analysis revealed that the disk was not stored on a floppy disk but could have been used
to gain access to a remote location.

powered on? Did the disk be corrupt or lost?
Or did the suspect OS fail to reboot the device
