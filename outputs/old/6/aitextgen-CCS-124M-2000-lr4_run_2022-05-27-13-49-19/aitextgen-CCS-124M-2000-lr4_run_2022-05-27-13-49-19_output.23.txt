Log analysis on  inconsistencies should not be possible in any cases. The forensic analyst
should be required to search for any specialists or judiciary in their or any other persons.
3.4.1

Report writing style

It is important that the digital forensics analyst is fully aware of the points to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all cases andIdeation were relevant. When identifying suitable exhibits to be conducted, an effective system
should be created and the software on which the evidence was found. When identifying suitable premises the following
were scanned:


Global forensics analyst status – signature required – search should be conducted to identify any exhibit or examination case.



24

Digital Forensics Guide



Lists and several other staff included can be seen in close conjunction with existing forensic software.


Prioritisation should be provided as a follow on the Council of Europe Electronic Evidence Guide which has been referred to at various
times in the last 3 years.



The Electronic Evidence Guide should be audited by the court to conduct a
investigator search and seizure of electronic evidence.
Depending on the legal framework, the acquisition of electronic evidence may be
declared as laid out in the Electronic Evidence Guide.

2.5.1

Further explanation of the Guide

A physical forensically important document should be provided to the laboratory along with adequate training to
be successful of the requirements of the Electronic Evidence Guide.
At this stage, any other evidence should be Word documents, videos, e-mails, and therefore media files in
a file system. This must be carried out without allowing access to the disk. If
the disk is blank or destroyed by any of the other persons, such as the MACs for the files and themedia. If required, a physical
examination of the disk should be created and produced at a later stage.
3.5.2

Office documents

As with the acquisition of digital data, digital forensics analysts should be prepared to examine
their digital forensics capability documents to identify artifacts of value to the digital forensic laboratory.
Digital forensics analyst – or – if possible – remote access should be given to the laboratory staff
 for ensuring all data is returned to the laboratory.Forensic analysts should ensure that they are fully aware of the
possibility of the data they accompany and what level of exam they are doing.
Digital forensics analyst - computers
The analysts should also be aware of the procedures that their analysts are going to examine. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensics analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
Digital forensics analyst – mobile devices
The analysts will require technical knowledge, and where possible appropriate qualifications. Ideally
they should have a clearly illustrate and understandable technical knowledge and an
understanding of the various methods of forensics. They should have some training in the use of mobile devices,
 Faraday bags and other staff. These staff
members will require specific training to bring them up to a suitable skill level. Digital
forensic analysts must have knowledge of legislation and be aware of the points to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensics analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
Forensic imaging analysts must have knowledge of legislation and be aware of the points to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensics analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
Forensic imaging technician
The role of the Imaging Technical is to take forensically sound copies (images) of computer hard
drives and other storage media. Depending on the size of the laboratory, several technicians may
be required. The Forensic Imaging Technician will need to have good technical knowledge and an
understanding of the various methods of forensically acquiring digital data. A key skill requirement
is attention to detail and the ability to clearly document all their actions, the verification of imaged
data and the continuity of evidence.
Administration
An important role within any laboratory is continuity of the evidence and requisite recording of the
chain of custody. Depending on the size of the laboratory and the required number of staff that may be employed, an
investigator needs to be established

CASE INFORMATION
Digital Forensics Guide

Prosecutor’s considerations
If the aim of the investigation was two-fold, to obtain all existing and qualitative evidence
with regard to the case and to be able to reproduce and explain forensic procedures which
led to the acquisition, the trial phase is the one confirming the quality or lack of quality of
the acquired evidence.
Admissibility of evidence represents the key outcome of the digital forensic process.
Prosecutors and judges are becoming increasingly comfortable with the existence and
admission of such electronic evidence. In some jurisdictions, not only is it that electronic
evidence is explicitly allowed by the criminal justice, but there are references and
deferred of computers, computer networks, software, hardware and data in substantive
and procedural parts of the legal framework. Also, in some jurisdictions, computer data is
defined as a movable object, to which all legal rules for tangible items can apply
(destruction, alteration, theft, alienation, alienation, exchange, exchange, etc.).
Some legal opinions about electronic evidence may consider it non-usable because of the
possibility of alteration and forgery. Under this logic, any other evidence could be
questioned as well. Forgeries of paper documents are widespread. Fingerprint forgery,
alteration of photographic, video and audio materials is common. In that sense, electronic
evidence should not be regarded as more volatile or unreliable, especially having in mind
that as society, industry and technology advance, more and more of traces, facts and
evidence will exist in digital form. Therefore, admissibility of electronic evidence as real
evidence should not represent an issue for prosecutor or judiciary, provided that the
procedures described in this Guide are followed.
The authenticity and reliability of electronic evidence must be ensured throughout the
digital forensics process. Forensic staff should have knowledge or/and pay attention to the
existence of an authentic search and seizure order (warrant) by a prosecutor or judge,
records of searched and seized places, items and taken actions, acknowledgement (if
applicable) of a suspect or person in possession of seized items, that records are
authentic, and so forth. Photographic or video recordings from the place were a search
was conducted and other documents and measures, if required by law, can also establish
that understanding. Furthermore, the authenticity of electronic evidence is preserved only
if digital forensic laboratory staff continue with actions which are carefully organised,
executed and recorded.
Completeness of the evidence can also sometimes represent a difficult task. On some occasions, the
investigation or defence is or they can only be done by one individual or
number who cannot actually understand the full extent of the prosecutor or is simply not able to explain to the
exhibits of that particular case.
Completeness of the evidence can also sometimes represent a difficult task, since some
parts of the evidence can be missing due to different factors and reasons, including
influence of the suspect and other persons involved in the actual case. On such occasions,

57

Digital Forensics Guide

forensic staff should concentrate on best possible approach to existing items and their
contents in order to extract the most comprehensive body of facts, without distortion or
bias.
Credibility is closely connected to authenticity and reliability and must be ensured in
writing. Written reports should provide clear explanations, logical connections and
trustable outcomes of procedures and conclusions as a result of the process. The forensic
exhibits should be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
parts and prosecution rooms are not equipped with hardware to support complex
presentations. Expert must be prepared to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. Forensic staff should have knowledge or/and pay attention to the
role of an abandoned personnel. Expert for such presentations
should be prepared to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. In some jurisdictions, the laboratory analyst is expected to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. For example, the investigator
should aim for the others to present their own evidence with a less thoroughly recorded
folder.
Depending on the size of the laboratory and the amount of suitable for the case, it may consider the
training of suitable presentations to be present. It may also be challenging to ensure that the evidence is
able and Having tested it against other jurisdictions in the digital forensics laboratory.
Another disadvantage is that there
