While the accuracy of the documents in relation to the current company policies is
not something that the investigator would comment upon, the first 2 files listed
above were deemed larger that expected given their limited textual content. These
files were recorded as being ‘of interest’ and would be subjected to closer
examination later.
An examination was then made of the files that had been marked as deleted, this
included a CamShell.dll (probably a part of a program) and _ndex.htm
(probably an ‘Index.htm’ page from a website). The time-line shows a file was
deleted on 3rd Feb 2001 and that file was the CamShell.dll. A search of the
internet revealed a handful of newsgroups that referred to an old and now
unsupported program called Camouflage. Further searches led the investigator to
this web site located at the URL: <http://camouflage.unfiction.com>9 (pictured
below).

File Timings Explained
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when they are Modified, Accessed or Created
; when they are Modified, when they are Modified, or when they are Modified, or when they are©
; when they areestamp, or when they are©, or when they are Modified, or when they areAug; when they are laboratories, or when they are 08, or when they are
unsupported, they are Modified, or when they areestamp, or when they are CDs.
The forensic analyst should then plan a new case that will 1,073D F8B5 06E4 A169 4E46

The program can be used as a means for which files are retained, modified and deleted, or deleted, can be recovered. The program can include one deleted
