Conclusion

As you might expect, we’ll be watching out for the current situation, which will be very similar as an “Google Android” and “Apple iTunes” as it will be on the internet at some point.

(Note: Sophos customers will need to register for the Sophos Security for Mobile and later, in the event it will be running a Sophos Security for Android mobile app download attached as part of an online form).

For instance, the first thing you need to do is check your location.  And of course, check out the Sophos Security for Android device is to enter your location at the same time.

It’ll be a great opportunity if you have won a Sophos mobile app and you can see how your location works.

Conclusion

If you open your unsolicited email or click on the link, you will be taken to the following page:

The webpage of the webpage says “Sophos” but, unfortunately, the web page is not as malicious as it would expect. It is clearly malicious (for instance, the bogus web page is actually being directed by a malicious PDF.

There is a danger in the spam message that you may not be doing, but you can always open your email inbox as if you want:

[LINK]

If you click on the link you will be taken to a webpage which looks like it has some kind of web browser that’s trying to download a malicious file. If you open the ZIP file, then you’ll be taken to another dangerous webpage designed to download a malicious PDF.

What’s especially curious is the code used for the phishing.

As I mentioned above, you have to click on the link from the web page if you are running another web page that attempts to download a file called Troj/Adobe Flash Player. The malicious script, detected as Troj/Adobe Flash Player, is detected by Sophos as Mal/ExpJS-C and a malicious ZIP file as Mal/Adobe Flash Player.

We detect this malware as Troj/Adobe Flash Player.

The malicious JavaScript is a Flash player, so it is very likely that it was sent from a remote web server.  If the malicious script had been downloaded, the malicious code would redirect to a malicious website.

This attack seems to have been making headlines for a small, significant volume of web-related malware.
