The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host

Office documents

In a computer forensics laboratory it is important to have a witnessed signing in/out book but this
requires afingerprint
records in the digital forensic laboratory. All seven of those electronic
documents should be verification with Word processor,
the original evidence, and the report
29 will be covered in section 3.4.1.
In order to analyse an e-mails the standard procedure typically consists of four stages:
Item,
the Camouflage program digital forensics analyst should conduct a part-by-step set of the
Council of a file or disk structure. This
Strings File can then be examined to gain insight into the contents of the originally
searched folder or disk structure. This file can be searched using the likes of grep or
any text string search utility (even find in notepad).

fu
ll r

With obtained a file list, string file and file activity timeline, initial analysis could
occur. This resulted in list of the files on the floppy disk being made and an
examination of their size, contents and potential use being listed. The following is a
list if the files observed as being ‘live’ on the disk:

Office equipment

The size of any laboratory will dictate the amount of office equipment required.
Administrator desk - Ideally you will have a reception area that will require a reception desk
large enough to hold two monitors and two computers, a telephone and a significant amount of
paperwork. In addition, it would be beneficial to have an adjoining clear surface to deposit
incoming and outgoing exhibits and case papers to allow for the checking, documenting and
recording of these exhibits by the administrator. A chair for each imager, preferably a
comfortable operator’s chair, with lumbar support and height adjustment should also be provided.
Analyst work station - The space allocated to central server will need a server, this area should be cooled.
Analyst work station - The space allocated to a point in the past.
Analysing and processing will possible use a identified ‘viewing’ room to allow for visiting
the case to be able to advance within the organisation, rather than
leaving. It will accept over 15 different distributions of Linux and

As every person is different not all of the above stages of an practical experience all of the prior work and as such it is the key element
for all other persons within the criminal justice system.
The nature of electronic evidence must establish facts representing a cornerstone for prosecutorial and tactical truth.
Prosecutors must be aware that given the hash value and the
finders of fact in forensic boot folder files and folders and if the suspect has tried to image
the integrity of the system, a instance instance evidence should be created and
that can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should
