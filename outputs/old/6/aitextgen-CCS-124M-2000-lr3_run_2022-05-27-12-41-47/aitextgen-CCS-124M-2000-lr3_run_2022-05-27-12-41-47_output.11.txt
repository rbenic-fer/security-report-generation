This software will store a suspect’s browsing history as well as details of his or her downloads, form
input numbers and general condition (assuming documents, emails etc.).
In cases where location data in a suspect’s Office documents should
be ‘purchased’ or simply advertising tricks
to increase hits. Therefore, this program can be used to
be seen more details of the kinds of traces that an examiner might discover during forensic
analysis. However, to provide a better overview that can assist in building a
system that can support the analysts provide more accurate reports for evidence.
Readers of this report should check if such advice already exists at the national level.

1.1.2

What is not included

The guide does not make any recommendations regarding hardware and software choices that may
be available. Each country and organisation will decide what is appropriate given their needs and
available funds. It should be remembered that digital forensics equipment and commercial software
can be a very expensive long term commitment and is not easy to change once the initial decision
is made. Details of the types of costs associated with forensic software purchases and information
about some options to use open source software are dealt with elsewhere in this document.

Digital Forensics Guide

This Guide and the information contained in it are considered valid until 31 December
2018. Where conditions permit the Guide will be updated before that date to reflect any
relevant changes in technology, procedures and practices. Any person or organisation
wishing to use the Guide after the above date should contact the Council of Europe to
obtain the most recent version.

1.2

Who is the Guide for?

This Guide is designed for two specific categories of reader:
1.

Those responsible for the development and management of their digital forensics
laboratory that will form part of an overall digital forensics strategy,

2.

Staff employed within a digital forensics team, in technical roles relating to the
digital forensics processes and procedures.

The guidance for the first group is designed to assist those responsible for developing digital
forensic strategies, making decisions about building digital forensics capability
– building digital forensics capability, purchasing
equipment and software.

The guidance for a group is designed to assist those responsible for developing digital
evidence and will try to identify artifacts of value to the digital forensic laboratory.

The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of digital forensic training purchases and guidance of everybody
employed within the laboratory.

The guidance for a group dedicated to render electronic evidence/evidence is designed to
address electronic evidence and will even find in relation to the
purchies of electronic evidence if not
 value value value value to electronic evidence, electronic evidence must establish
that in many cases the natural reaction is to reject the facts;

2.3

Size

When considering the size of any laboratory, considerations that account for the various tasks that
will be conducted within must be made. It is best practice to try and segregate the specific types of
activities to prevent cross contamination and loss of exhibits.
A reception type area where evidence can be delivered or collected without allowing access to the
actual laboratory should be incorporated in the planning of the digital forensic laboratory. A high
priority is the need for a secure area to store exhibits and sensitive data. This should be a room
located within the digital forensic laboratory. Alternatively a fixed metal cage could be used,
depending on the amount of exhibits likely to be stored. Any access to and removal or return of
exhibits to the storage room must be recorded. As with access to the laboratory, there are several
different physical and virtual methods to achieve this.

This software will store a suspect’s browsing history as well as details of his or her downloads, form
inputs, cookies, etc., but it can either be disabled or deleted by the suspect. Another example can
be the “Start” menu and the suspect’s Office programs that ‘remember’ which files the suspect has
opened recently. There are various types of ‘avoidable’ traces automatically stored on the hard disk
in this way (as shown in the table below). However, they can be prevented by someone who knows
what they are doing.
Unavoidable traces: By contrast, unavoidable traces are traces that are stored by the operation system. On such occasions,
can be undertaken that they are only able to traces that are relevant given that

forensic staff should concentrate on best possible approach to existing items and their
contents in order to extract the most comprehensive body of facts, without distortion or
bias.
Credibility is closely connected to authenticity and must be ensured in
writing. Written reports should provide clear explanations, logical connections and
trustable outcomes of procedures and conclusions as a result of the process. The forensic
examiner should always be aware that in case of court summoning, a verbal presentation
of the findings and testing of the believability will most probably occur. In such a case, an
examiner should possess thorough knowledge of the report, procedures and conclusions.
An examiner presenting and explaining findings in court or before the prosecution should
have certain skills for verbal presentations. He/she must bear in mind that the judge and
all parties present in the courtroom will carefully listen and follow not only the examiner’s
words, but his/her appearance and overall impression as well.
Of course, proportionality is expected. Any unauthorised intrusion or coercive measure
will most certainly lead to the inadmissibility of evidence. Also, by following good
practices of the rule of law, facts and evidence which are in favour of the defence should
be presented and made available to the judge.
When it comes to report writing, it is of the outmost importance that the language is
clear and understandable, but not diluted to the point where quality of the evidence will
be lost. In most situations, defence attorneys will object to more complex language of the
report and will try to advocate for additional examination for clarifying the initial report.
This is one of the frequent techniques for prolonging the trial in cases when a prison
sentence is expected. Any decision about this motion will be in the hands of the judge
(rarely – prosecutors), and examiners should be ready such a development. In such a
case, the content of the request should be carefully analysed and appropriate actions
should taken into account when the prison.
This in mind should not represent an issue for prosecutor or judiciary, provided that the
procedures described in the floppy disk are followed. The situation and
applicable program between forensic analysis and content

The system was a reasonable specification and in business would most
likely have been reused for some other task as it met the min spec for
Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2003 Server and XP Pro (or home).

Using widely-accepted digital forensic techniques and procedures, digital forensic
personnel from the mobile network, that have been
compromised in a particular way, which will allow the examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
3.2.2.1 Categories of examination
There are five different levels of examination for mobile devices, with the best possible extraction
being listed first:


Physical









File System Dump (FSD)



Logical



Manual



JTAG / Chip-Off / Rooting / Jail Breaking

A physical copy of the device is the process of acquiring all of the raw binary data from the storage
of the storage media. This raw data then needs to be analysed and processed at a later stage by software.
39

Digital Forensics Guide

This method typically will allow the examiner to access live and deleted data, operating system files
and areas of the device that are not normally accessible to the user.
Mobile devices, unlike computer devices, have further acquisition strategies. The other main
strategy is a File System Dump (FSD). An FSD is like a hybrid of a Physical and a Logical
acquisition. FSDs retrieve the devices file system and interpret the data during the processing
stage. This allows examiners to retrieve, for example, databases holding deleted messages that
may not be available at a logical acquisition and may not be accessible at a logical acquisition of site, at a first or during a physical
acquisition. However, not all deleted data that it would be possible to retrieve with a physical
acquisition would be acquired during an FSD.
A logical acquisition of the mobile device will involve receiving information from the
devices during an FSD. FSDs retrieve the devices file system. This is often the equivalent of accessing the
