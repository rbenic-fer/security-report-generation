 knowledge. It is worth noting, as both the mount command and the Linux

Windows XP Proxsystems. However, as the Linux file permissions were set to

Stroz Friedberg found substantial evidence that all three of the Word documents
containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date and time at which computer activity, such as the creation or modification
of documents, occurred. Backdating can be accomplished by setting the system clock
on a computer hard drive to an earlier date, such that activity that occurs on the hard
drive while the computer is in a backdated state will appear to have occurred at that
earlier time.

In the example above, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained the MAC times of the original carried files. Thus
when the carried files are exported from the carrier file a new instance is
written to the new media and although this will have a different creation time
again, it will retain the original accessed and modification times.

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.

The first a Virus Scan was performed using Norton Anti Virus a good produce that
the investigator is familiar with, it is configurable and it will detect Trojans, Viruses,
Worms and {as we will see only some} Malware. On this occasion it revealed one
virus called ‘polmx2.cab’ which it classed as a Trojan.

====================
Log analysis on  MSTS
 forensic boot sector cybercrime by CEPOL, ECT access can be undertaken to gain
an exemplary report, which in many cases the natural reaction is to reject the facts; evidence
purchased to establish recent statistics on the scope of the digital
forensic analysis software being used by the kernel varied between devices and USB
ports. The information gathered during the
analysis process captured is just as relevant to any of the digital forensic analysis. The steps are
often times repeatable for specific categories of cases. Even though they are resource intensive
needing a lot of computing power and time they can typically be run over-night, over the weekend
or on a second forensic workstation that is not in use.
The automated processing includes tasks like:


mounting of containers (e.g. ZIP, RAR, etc)



extraction and parsing of various artefacts (e.g. mailboxes, internet history, etc)



signature analysis



recovering deleted files and folders



recovering deleted partitions



carving for certain file types



indexing of keywords



OCR of PDF files



creation of thumbnail pictures for quicker viewing by the analyst



extracting pictures from videos



hash comparison (see chapter 3.3.1.6)

While a streamlined approach is possible it is not necessary in all cases.
3.3.1.5 Data recovery
Recovering deleted data can be essential if no evidential files have been found in the allocated
areas of the disk. Data recovery is possible on different levels. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a disk are shown in the forensic forensic forensic laboratory. forensic analyst if possible passwords or pattern is already known prior to examination, then the files/devices are
available should be scanned for. The next one tried is “Password” this was the first
method to
indicate if any errors have been found during the verification process.
3.3.1.6 Filtering techniques
Applying filters to an image before it is being analysed can help to understand at which point of time which amount of
money has been sent over which channel by which persons.
Applying filters to any other,appointment the contents of the Password_Policy.doc and
Remote_Access_Policy.doc files that were unusually large and whose
size was not proportionate to their contents.

3.3.4.1.5 Data recovery
Recovering deleted data can be essential if no evidential files have been found in the allocated
areas of the disk. Data recovery is possible on different levels. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a disk are shown in the forensic forensic software or if there are any
notable partition gaps. Those gaps should be scanned for additional partitions. The next one tried is to
undelete files and folders from a file system. After that, additional files can be recovered by
scanning the unallocated areas for known file headers and footers (carving).
3.4.1.6 Filtering techniques
Applying filters to an image before it is being analysed can help to understand the special
characteristics of an image (15 different file types of forensic software and if no image
handling is found in the forensic boot sector).
3.4.1.7 Filtering techniques
Filtering of a mobile device is typically performed on a data type level. Data is filtered by tools during
processing into groups such as relevant for the processing and analysis of the data. These groups are then further
divided; for example communication data can be divided into call records and messages. The level
of filtering presented to the analyst depends on the tool being used, however this filtering allows
analysts to quickly review key data types, such as sent and received SMS messages and call
records to establish contact between suspects.
Prosecutor's considerations
The processing stage can be of vital importance to identification of 22
evidence. A physical copy of a mobile device is made available to the laboratory along with a physical copy of the original data due to the
data on the original evidence. This raw data then needs to be analysed and processed at a later stage by software.

This method typically will allow the examiner to gain access to a dataG screen, such as sent and received SMS messages and call
records to establish contact between suspects.
Prosecutor's considerations
If the mobile device is not isolated and allowed to beconnect to external networks, such as sent or received SMS messages and call
records to establish contact between suspects.
Prosecutor's considerations
If the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination, this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making these system changes.
This will allow the examiner to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should
