Type of events and supposition by the analyst


©


The following is the summary of the events; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
electronic evidence produced by the investigator.

rr

The user was relatively new to computing and did not really understand much of
what was going on. For example:
ByBy the 8th August 2004 they appear to have become annoyed with the popups their
Spyware was generating and they installed popup stopper. But given the number of
items of Spyware and the fact that many had been legitimately installed (having
duped the user), this had little chance of stopping the problem, furthermore, they
were only treating the symptoms and not the cause.

With files containing on several floppy disk wentd be analysed and all of his
source drive and all of his or any
Company system, the HDD was often times/hardware. On every X seconds of the user attempted to install a
defensive piece of software.
This had proved in the investigators experience to be the best possible breaches of the /proc and
Troackers/images.

With the image marked as read-only in the Linux file permissions, the image was
mounted as a loop-back read only device in the /mnt/unknown directory. This
was to allow the investigator see for the first time the directory structure.
Additionally, as both the mount command and the Linux file permissions were set to
read-only, browsing could be undertaken without fear of altering the data.

The data embedded in the 2nd part of the practical required the analysis of a mobile device, a subdirectory with a name containing the numeric date
7/25/2014, and containing a video file with a file name including the numeric date 7/25/2014. Another example of the
folder and file naming structure is shown below.

[root]\PPGC040915\[Investigator 2]\20150409\FNNI0773_20150409071900.AVI

In this example (on the following page), the video file named Camouflage.txt which is of the same time duration as captured by the original video camera with reliable and consistent
timecodes.
The timecodes embedded in the video recordings are not
synced to each other. Coalfire determined the approximate offsets of the two video cameras for each day of recording.

Video Camera Timecode Offset

By establishing the offset in timecode, Coalfire was able to compare events from each of the cameras as they happened
in real time. This was critical when comparing the raw footage videos contained on the flash drive to the Full Footage
videos released by the Center for Medical Progress on YouTube. The Full Footage CMP YouTube videos are listed below
and uploaded by the YouTube user “The Center for Medical Progress”.

Coalfire reviewed any and all inconsistencies in timecode apparent in the Full Footage videos for comparison to the raw
video footage corresponding to those videos. Notes were made upon review of the raw video content which described
the events that took place during the missing footage that was edited from the Full Footage videos. Events that were left
out of the Full Footage videos lacked pertinent conversation. The events depicted in the missing footage fell into five
common categories: commuting, waiting, adjusting recording equipment, meals, evidence
equipment and Videos. �

defensive piece of software in the form of ‘Spyblocker’ from <www.spyblockersoftware.com>, this can be seen from the time line entries coloured blue, that
relate to the installation and modification of 6 files, and referred to in the installation

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the floppy disk.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.

The first a Virus Scan was performed using Norton Anti Virus a good produce that
the investigator is familiar with, it is configurable and it will detect Trojans, Viruses,
Worms and {as we will see only some} Malware. On this occasion it revealed one
virus called ‘polmx2.cab’ which it classed as a Trojan.
