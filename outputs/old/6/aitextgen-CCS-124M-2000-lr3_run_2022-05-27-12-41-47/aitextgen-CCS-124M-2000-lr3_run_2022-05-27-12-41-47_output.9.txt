3.4.1.2 Triaging techniques
Filtering of mobile data is typically performed on a data type level. Data is filtered by tools during
processing into groups such as communication data and media files. These groups are then further
divided; for example communication data can be divided into call records and messages. The level
of filtering presented to the analyst depends on the tool being used, however this filtering allows
analysts to quickly review key data types, such as sent and received SMS messages and call
records to establish contact between suspects.
Prosecutor's considerations
The processing stage can be of vital importance to the prosecution. Although technical
data (evidence) is very much needed, one should not forget that the complete picture of
the case is and should be with prosecutor during the investigation phase. Forensic
expert witness status and phone evidence must be preserved to manually record the data. Some
of available tools, such as JTAG or Chip-Off will require further tools, including soldering
equipment and specialist jigs to read raw data from the device’s memory chips.
3.2.2.6 Levels of examination
There are five different levels of examination for mobile devices, with the best possible extraction

A physical copy of the device is the process of acquiring all of the raw binary data from the storage
of the device. This raw data then needs to be analysed and processed at a later stage by software.

Digital Forensics Guide

This method typically will allow the examiner to access live and deleted data, operating system files
and areas of the device that are not normally accessible to the user.
Mobile devices, unlike computer devices, have further acquisition strategies. The other main
strategy is a File System Dump (FSD). An FSD is like a hybrid of a Physical and a Logical
acquisition. FSDs retrieve the devices file system and interpret the data during the processing
stage. This allows examiners to retrieve, for example, databases holding deleted messages that
may not be available at a logical acquisition and may not be accessible during a physical
acquisition. However, not all deleted data that it would be possible to retrieve with a physical
acquisition would be acquired during an FSD.
A logical acquisition of the mobile device will involve receiving information from the device and
allowing the device to present the data for analysis. This is often the equivalent of accessing the
data on the device itself. This method typically will only make live data available to the examiner. If
no other method is available, a method termed “manual examination” can be used. This method
inv during the processing process.
Prosecutor's considerations
This method typically will only make live data available to the examiner. If a suspect has tried to cover his or her tracks.

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was to allow the investigator to find a full copy of the contents of the originally
searched file. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

3.2.1.5

Admissibility of mobile devices

As with computer-based examinations, the following information should be
obtained in this report with which the examiner needs to report:

3.2.1.2

Report writing

The digital forensics report reflects all the procedures and outcomes of the steps that have been
conducted before. It is the only one outcome of all the prior work and as such it is the key element
for all other persons within the criminal justice system.
The nature of the report that it is being used in courts to help proving guilt or innocence of a
person does not only make it an extremely important document but also causes some challenges
for the forensic analyst. One of the biggest challenges is to make the report understandable for
non-technical people. So a forensic report must establish aThispNext report with which to5 all existing
evidence within the laboratory.
This nature can be performed by examiners to prosecutors and other parties involved in the criminal justice system.
The nature of electronic evidence to
be examined is an important part of a digital forensic analysis. The evidence must establish facts in a way that cannot be disputed and is
representative of its original state.
Completeness of the evidence can also sometimes represent a difficult task, since the evidence may establish
that understanding. Furthermore, the following criteria should be taken to ensure that the document is followed at all times:
Item79 – Attempting to another
(TSK), in a way to which all legal rules
have been apply.
Completeness of the evidence can also sometimes represent a difficult task, since some
parts of the evidence can be missing due to different factors and reasons, including
influence of the suspect and other persons involved in the actual case. On such occasions,

57

Digital Forensics Guide

forensic staff should concentrate on best possible approach to existing items and their
contents in order to extract the most comprehensive body of facts, without distortion or
bias.
Credibility is closely connected to authenticity and must be ensured in
writing. Written reports should provide clear explanations, logical connections and
trustable outcomes of procedures and conclusions as a result of the process. The forensic
examiner should always be aware that in case of court summoning, a verbal presentation
of the findings and testing of the believability will most probably occur. In such a case, an
examiner should possess thorough knowledge of the report, procedures and conclusions.
An examiner presenting and explaining findings in court or before the prosecution should
have certain skills for verbal presentations. He/she must bear in mind that the language is
clear and understandable, but not diluted to the point where quality of the evidence will
be lost. In that sense, proportionality is
mounted and understandable, and that in many cases the natural reaction is to reject the facts; in
this case, an examiner should always be alert to
the mind of the judge and be alert to the factfinder that the language is
clear and understandable, but not diluted to the point where quality of the evidence will
be lost. In most situations, defence attorneys should be more relevant language of the
report and will try to advocate for additional examination for clarifying the initial report.
This is one of the frequent techniques for prolonging the trial in cases when a prison
sentence is expected. Any decision about this motion will be in the hands of the judge
(rarely – prosecutors), and examiners should be ready such a development. In such a
case, the content of the request should be carefully analysed and appropriate actions
should taken into account when the analysis.
This situation can be of crucial importance:
Principle 1 – Data integrity
No action taken should materially change any data, electronic device or media which may
7

Digital Forensics Guide

subsequently be used as evidence in court.
Principle 2 – Audit trail
A record of all actions taken when handling electronic evidence should be created and preserved so
that they can be subsequently audited. An independent third party should not only be able to
repeat those actions, but also to achieve the same result.
Principle 3 – Specialist support
If it is expected that electronic evidence may be found in the course of a planned operation, the
person in charge of the operation should notify specialists/external advisers in time and to arrange
their presence if possible.
Principle 4 – Appropriate training
First responders must have the necessary and appropriate training to bring them up to a suitable skill level.
Principle 5 - Legality
First responders must have the necessary and appropriate training to bring them up to a suitable skill level.

The forensic Laptop used for this examination was a Dell Inspiron 5100. The
specification of the laptop being; Intel Pentium 4 2800 MHz with 768Mb RAM, a
CDR/RW and 3com on board network card. The graphics processor was a 64 mb
Mobile ATI card with a 1024x768 TFT screen. It boasts a IEEE 1394 port as well as
2 x USB 2 ports. This laptop has more than proven itself in the past and the
performance of each of the components has been well above standard without the
need for specialist drivers. It will accept over 15 different distributions of Linux and
has run Windows from 95 – 2003 Enterprise Server. As the caddie cost in the
region of £30) the Main Forensic OS was a free distribution(FC2) and the
laptop (inc 2 extra HDD and internal caddie drives) cost £550 (~$1030) the whole
forensic outfit was comparatively cheep £580 ($1085).

The only glitch that was presented was with the use of the external caddie which
connects IDE devices to either IEEE 1394 or USB2. While MS Windows was able
to address the device, Fedora Core 2 did not have any support for it in the kernel.
That said some research on the internet did reveal a patch had been submitted (see
below) which when applied allowed the external caddie to be mounted in the
Fedora Core 2 (FC2) OS in read only mode.
