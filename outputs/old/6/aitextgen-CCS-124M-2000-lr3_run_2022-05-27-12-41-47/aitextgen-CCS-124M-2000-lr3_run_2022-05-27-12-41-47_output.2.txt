The06E4systems stages of a digital forensics report, the following information was
obtained by Autopsy (under investigation). The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg has followed the terms of the Protocol for all data found on the Ceglia
Media and any other data subject to the Protocol during its analysis, including the
procedures for privilege review and production set forth above and the maintenance of
a search log.

During this analysis, Stroz Friedberg employed a methodology tailored to the particular
facts of this case. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included: (1) conducting keyword and
other searches of the digital forensic copies of the Ceglia Media and other data,
including webmail accounts, to identify responsive documents or fragments of
documents; (2) manually reviewing the documents containing keyword hits hits hits hits hits hits, certain
unsearchable file types, such as image files with no text, and other documents to
determine whether they were relevant to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails; and (3) reviewing the digital forensic copies of the
Ceglia Media for digital forensic artifacts relevant to the
Amended Complaint and theNotes of the 174
floppy disks.

Findings
No exact copies of the Work for Hire Document were found on the Ceglia Media,
which comprised hundreds of pieces of media - including computers, hard drives and
floppy disks. Stroz Friedberg used a methodology that would have identified any
copies of the Work for Hire Document on the Ceglia Media if they had been present.
Instead of the purported Work for Hire Document, Stroz Friedberg found on the Ceglia
Media seven unsigned versions of the Work for Hire Document that are very similar but
not identical to the purported Work for Hire Document. All seven of those electronic
documents contain metadata anomalies indicative of backdating and document
manipulation.
Mr. Ceglia’s Amended Complaint purports to quote from or otherwise reference 22
Purported Emails between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg. During the litigation, Mr.
Ceglia acknowledged that he did not keep the Purported Emails referenced in the
Amended Complaint in their original native form, that is to say, as individual files in
message format. Rather, he claimed to have copied-and-

Administration
Analysing a computer systems, the following information was
obtained by Autopsy (under it).

1.1.1 Case-specific considerations
Before analysing a case it is important to ask the case officer what type of
 data is needed for this
case. The information provided should include a scope of which data are relevant and which data
can be filtered out. Based on that information the analyst can consider which processing options
might be applicable. Depending on the case and the warrant it should also be considered which
data might be subject to data protection, legally privilege or some other form of access restriction,
for example journalistic material.
3.3.1.2 Triaging techniques
In cases that involve lots of computer systems and storage media it might not be possible for this to be an
digital forensics team. That is why the forensic analyst should hold a lot of evidential data. Those forensic
laboratories can typically not be used on a daily basis. Those that cannot be disabled due to lack of
memory space and will need a triage approach. The medium can include images featuring theon a setuplogs and software on the screen, with which all
investigator data can be analysed. The analyst can typically not cover a full acquisition of a suspect or crime using the
forensic boot medium to access the data from the provider.
3.2.1.1.1 Categories of digital traces
Just as a criminal leaves physical traces behind at a crime scene, the criminal that commits a crime
by computer will leave traces at a “digital crime scene”.
To get a better idea of the kinds of digital traces that an examiner might discover during forensic
analysis, it makes sense to distinguish between two types of digital traces:
Avoidable traces: These are traces that are stored by the operation system and applications by
default, but which a system can be configured not to store. Take a web browser as an example.
This software will store a suspect’s browsing history as well as details of his or her downloads, form
inputs, cookies, etc., but it can either be disabled or deleted by the suspect. Another example can
be the “Start’ menu and the suspect’s Office programs that ‘remember’ which files the suspect has
opened recently. There are various types of ‘avoidable’ traces automatically stored on the hard disk
in this way (as shown in the table below). However, they can be prevented by someone who knows
what they are doing.
Unavoidable traces: By contrast, unavoidable traces are, of course, those that cannot be disabled
or those that require considerable effort to stop temporarily. The probability of finding such traces
is correspondingly high even if a suspect has tried to cover his or her tracks.

3.4.1.2 Procedures for different traces
Every case typically involves some particularly relevant traces. In a fraud case for example
documents, spreadsheets and e-mails are typically more relevant while in child-abuse cases
pictures, videos and communication traces are more relevant. But even within those categories of
cases not every case is the same. That is why the following subchapters included information on
procedures based on the type of type that is relevant rather than the type of case.
3.4.1.2.1

E-Mails

To analyse e-mail communication it is not only important to analyse mail clients like Outlook,
Thunderbird or Mail but also webmail accounts. The former will be covered in this subchapter while
the latter will be covered in section 3.4.1.2.4.
In order to analyse an e-mail client it is important to know which artefact that e-mail client
produces. Outlook for example stores evidential data in personal folder files such as PST, OST and
PAB files while Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files. The forensic software suites can usually
parse those files. However, they do not necessarily extract all

With the image marked in the boot sector in the Linux file permissions, the image was
mounted as a loop-back read only only in the Linux file permissions. This
was to allow the investigator see for the first time the directory structure.
Additionally, as both the mount command and the Linux file permissions were set to
read-only, browsing could be undertaken without fear of altering the data.

As suggested above, although there has been no Criminal Law breach, the
Corporate Espionage that appears to be been conducted can be addressed
through the UK civil courts. Furthermore, this procedure carries less risk for the
Company and achieves results considerably quicker. Having consulted with several
UK IT Security lawyers it was confirmed that a Criminal case can take upto 18
months from the incident to appear in court. Additionally, the incident is turned over
to the UK Police, who conduct the investigation as best they can with shifting
priorities and reducing resources.
The civil court route places the responsibility in the Company’s hands as they
choose their investigators and legal team. The lawyers consulted spoke of cases
taking less then 4 months from incident to the court case investigator and the aware of
damages.
Furthermore, the weight of argument required in a civilian court is less as ‘the

As to breaching Ballard’s own Policies, the position is not clear cut there either:

Here the subject could claim they were not aware of the sensitivity of the
data he exported; however, this is unlikely to stand up to the balance of
probabilities (remembering he had probably worked there for some time as
he was the lead engineer) and there was no accident to the hiding and
passwording of these files.

labels.  Prior to the processing and analysis of each and every piece of evidence, priorisation
would still allow analysis of all exhibits. It would however start with more relevant training to see
whether this might contain enough evidence for a conviction or acquittal. Examples for a
prioritisation would be to analyze:


the main suspect's computer before witness’s PC,



urgent cases / high profile cases before low profile cases,



encrypted data before unencrypted data, and



certain data types (e.g. documents, emails) before others.

Overall process model (e.g. documents, emails) before others.

3.2

Acquisition of computer data

As processing computer data is the process is run a), the medium can be run over-night, over the weekend
or on a second forensic workstation that is not in use.
The automated processing includes tasks like:


mounting of containers (e.g. mailboxes, internet history, etc)



recovering deleted content and user gives it their suspect or to shows
full problems.



To analyse e-mail communication it is of vital importance thatmail addresses attacked a server or other type of evidential
media that e-mail client
produces. Outlook for example stores evidential data in personal folder files such as PST, OST and
PAB files while Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files. The forensic software suites can usually
parse those files. However, they do not necessarily extract all messages. Some forensic tools, for
example, have problems extracting deleted messages from personal folder files.
3.4.1.2.1

Office documents

In cases in which office documents are of importance the digital forensics analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst needs to either crack that facts,
or to MS-spyware or program some data wills during the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst should conduct some
signature analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst
47

Digital Forensics Guide

can search for further evidence of when those documents have been produced, by which user they
have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons.
3.4.1.3

Pictures / videos

Most forensics software solutions offer support for analysing masses of pictures and videos. After
an initial file signature analysis and setting a filter for pictures and video files, the forensics analyst
47

Digital Forensics Guide

can use a gallery view to inspect the thumbnails of all pictures for case relevant evidence. For a
faster analysis of video files certain software offers the feature of extracting still pictures from the
videos (e.g. every X seconds/minutes depending on the settings). These extracted images can then
be viewed in a gallery view as well.
If the case requires searching for a set of known pictures (e.g. child abuse material or stolen
blueprintsprints, etc), hash comparison can be used to accomplish this task. There are even techniques
available that enable searching for similar pictures with another hash value (fuzzy hashing,
similarity hashes, PhotoDNA, etc.).
In cases where location data or production details of pictures and video files are important the
analyst should consider extracting meta-data (e.g. exif data) for those files. In fact analysing meta
data and putting evidence into context in the major task for the forensic analyst in
