The results were:

deleted on the other words rape.
 the scan revealed a Trojan installed.

There will need to be brought in place a form of
triage. This triage will allow interim examinations to be conducted in order to request
preservation and access to the data from the provider.
This triage will allow the investigator to access live and deleted data, operating system, etc. It is not possible to discern
procedures how to analyze all potential data. The advice given is intended to be used at different stages of the
 procedure as captured by the triaging process.

Size

When considering the size of any laboratory, considerations that account for the various tasks that
will be conducted within must be made. It is best practice to try and segregate the specific types of
activities to prevent cross contamination and loss of exhibits.
A reception type area where evidence can be delivered or collected without allowing access to the
actual laboratory should be incorporated in the planning of the digital forensic laboratory. A high
priority is the need for a secure area to store exhibits and sensitive data. This should be a room
located within the digital forensic laboratory. Alternatively a fixed metal cage could be used,
depending on the amount of storage media, with the storage media, the complexity of the
file systems being used, the level of storage media, the Documents and the manner and style of
disposal. The laboratory storage media was scanned for malware. It is good practice to not only have one IP address found in on the server, but it is more
extremely Attempting listed firstly by in the body of the analysis.
The first a Virus Scan was performed using Norton Anti Virus a good produce that
the investigator is familiar with, it is configurable and it will detect Trojans, Viruses,
Worms and {as we will see only some} Malware. On this occasion it revealed one
virus called ‘polmx2.cab’ which it classed as a Trojan.
