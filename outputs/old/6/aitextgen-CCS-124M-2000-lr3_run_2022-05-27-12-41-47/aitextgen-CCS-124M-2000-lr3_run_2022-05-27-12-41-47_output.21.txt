The time and date discrepancy observed was not expected and was contrary to the

A lack of use (or synchronisation with an internet clock)

discounted.

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.

The first a Virus Scan was performed using Norton Anti Virus a good produce that
the investigator is familiar with, it is configurable and it will detect Trojans, Viruses,
Worms and {as we will see only some} Malware. On this occasion it revealed one
virus called ‘polmx2.cab’ which it classed as a Trojan.

will allow the examiner to gain full access to the
the laboratory once it has been identified. It is important that the manager understands the overarching principles described in the Evidence Evidence Guide and reiterated earlier on in these operating processes. The laboratory
manager should have control over the original set up, identifying the building, purchasing
equipment and software and setting the procedures and functions of the laboratory. They should be
responsible for leading the recruiting, training, mentoring, counselling and guidance of everybody
employed within the unit.
Digital forensics analyst - computers
The analysts will require technical knowledge, and where possible appropriate qualifications. Ideally
they should have some training in the use of digital forensic software. Alternately these staff
members will require specific forensic training to bring them up to a suitable skill level. Digital
forensic analysts must have knowledge of legislation and be aware of the points to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.

analysts must have knowledge of legislation and be aware of the points to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
Forensic imaging technician
The role of the Imaging Technical is to take forensically sound copies (images) of computer hard
drives and other storage media. Depending on the size of the laboratory, several technicians may
be required. The Forensic Imaging Technician will need to have good technical knowledge and an
understanding of the various methods of forensically acquiring digital data. A key skill requirement
is attention to detail and the ability to clearly document all their actions, the verification of imaged
data and the continuity of evidence.
Administration
An important role within any laboratory is continuity of the evidence and requisite recording of the
chain of custody. Depending on the size of the laboratory and the amount of electronic evidence to
be examined, an administrator role may need to be filled. The administrator would take
responsibility for documenting each new case, checking the exhibit numbers/serial numbers and
case files are all accounted for. Other considerations include


Making decisions about the seriousness of the investigation.



Prioritisation of cases.



Entering the information onto a case management system.



Liaison with outside agencies, police officers and the rest of the laboratory team.




Strong oral and written communication and attention to details.

2.4.1

Recruiting

Recruitment should start as soon as the business case has been accepted and the premises are
identified. Having key staff on hand to assist with the identification and selection of hardware and
software would be beneficial. It may be that these key staff are already trained or are familiar with
a certain type of forensic software and would rather work with this. Ideally the roles and
responsibilities of each vacancy will be established prior to advertising.

2.4.2

Police officers or police support staff?

Some forensic laboratories will be staffed totally by serving police officers, some with only support
staff and others with a combination of both. There are pros and cons for each option.
Police officers tend to have better investigative knowledge and are more familiar with legislation
and points to prove criminal action. They will be less likely to move onto other job opportunities
and will be more used to working unsociable hours.
18

Digital Forensics Guide

Support staff may have more relevant technical qualifications and received more training. They
may have practical experience in the investigation of digital data but may be more inclined to seek
career progression and move to the private sector.
A mixture of both may improve your overall technical ability and provide a more diverse team.
