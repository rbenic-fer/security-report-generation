The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.

The first a Virus Scan was performed using Norton Anti Virus a good produce that
the investigator is familiar with, it is configurable and it will detect Trojans, Viruses,
Worms and {as we will see only some} Malware. On this occasion it revealed one
virus called ‘polmx2.cab’ which it classed as a Trojan.

Item 37 – Quote from Microsoft explaining the HDD ID Tag

You might also see the OEM ID "MSWIN4.0" on disks formatted by
Windows 95 and "MSWIN4.0" on disks formatted by Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2), Windows Me.
Professional does not use the OEM ID field in the boot sector except for
verifying NTFS volumes.

igh
ts.

Therefore, it is assumed that the hard disk was formatted with either Windows 95
(OSR2), Windows 98 or Windows ME. Whilst it is not impossible for this to be a
production system, this latest fact would more than hint to a personal user.

Digital Forensics Guide

forensic staff should concentrate on best possible approach to existing items and their
contents in order to extract the most comprehensive body of facts, without distortion or
bias.
Credibility is closely connected to authenticity and must be ensured in
writing. Written reports should provide clear explanations, logical connections and
trustable outcomes of procedures and conclusions as a result of the process. The forensic
examiner should always be aware that in case of court summoning, a verbal presentation
of the findings and testing of the believability will most probably occur. In such a case, an
examiner should possess thorough knowledge of the report, procedures and conclusions.
An examiner presenting and explaining findings in court or before the prosecution should
have certain skills for verbal presentations. He/she must bear in mind that the judge and
all parties present in the courtroom will carefully listen and follow not only the examiner’s
words, but his/her appearance and overall impression as well.
Of course, proportionality is expected. Any unauthorised intrusion or coercive measure
will most certainly lead to the inadmissibility of evidence. Also, by following good
practices of the rule of law, facts and evidence which are in favour of the defence should
be presented and made available to the defence as well.
When it comes to report writing, it is of the outmost importance that the language is
clear and understandable, but not diluted to the point where quality of the evidence will
be lost. In most situations, defence attorneys will object to more complex language of the
report and will try to advocate for additional examination for clarifying the initial report.
This is one of the frequent techniques for prolonging the trial in cases when a prison
sentence is expected. Any decision about this motion will be in the hands of the judge
(rarely – prosecutors), and examiners should be ready such a development. In such a
case, the content of the request should be carefully analysed and appropriate actions
should be taken, without prejudice to the principal task of forensic analysis as requested
by prosecutor or judge.
The forensic expert must take into account that not many prosecutors and even a smaller
number of judges feel comfortable with cybercrime, electronic evidence, digital forensics
reports and similare, and that in many cases the natural reaction is to reject the facts; in
this case, such issues should be more thoroughly explained in person during the expert
testimony. Forensic experts must be prepared and flexible on such occasions.
Te expert witness status will vary from the technical processes of the court and forensic experts must be prepared to referred and
detases of the steps that have been adopted in the forensics process.
Te expert witness status will vary from country to country. In some systems, experts are
engaged by the prosecution and defence, in some systems they are court-appointed, and
there is number of mixed systems in which all parties and the court alike
hire expert could appoint or
hire expert at different stages of the proceedings.
However, it is very likely that the language style of the expert witness coming from the forensics
laboratory of the state authority will be engaged by the prosecution or court. This also

means that the court alike is the same item produced by the prosecution. Stroz Friedberg
also found what it believes to be the authentic contract between Mr. Ceglia and Mr.
Zuckerberg. That contract contains no references to Facebook. As described more fully
in this report, Stroz Friedberg made the following findings bearing on the authenticity
of the Work for Hire Document and the Purported Emails between Mr. Ceglia and Mr.
Zuckerberg did not find any exact copies of the Work for Hire Document on the
hundreds of pieces of media produced by Mr. Ceglia, including three
hard drives, 174 floppy disks, and 1,087 CDs (here).
Stroz Friedberg did identify the Microsoft Word documents into which Mr. Ceglia
claims to have copied-and-pasted the text of the Purported Emails. All of these Word
documents were backdated to appear as if they were created at earlier dates.
The digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of each piece of
media, including the active user-accessible files, the deleted-and-pasted-a5796a07076 (PDP).
