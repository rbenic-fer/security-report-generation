3.4.1.2 Procedures for different traces
Every case typically involves some particularly relevant traces. relevant traces include


mounting of mobile devices, with the processing of computer exhibits,
complexity of mobile phones, viewing and editing.



Processing stage





recovering deleted data



recovering deleted data can be essential if no evidential files have been found in the allocated
areas of the disk. Data recovery is possible on different levels. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a disk are shown in the forensic forensic forensic laboratory.
3.4.1.2.1

Office equipment

The processing and processing of mobile phones typically requires a different approach to computers due to the wildly
varying hardware and software used between devices. Applications are updated with a much
greater frequency and changes can often be major. For this reason, dedicated forensic tools will
44

Digital Forensics Guide

automatically process much of the data, however manual verification of this processing is often
necessary. A number of available tools use a form of “fuzzy processing”, that is to say the
processing is implemented in such a way as to leverage logic and loose matches.
3.4.1.2 Filtering techniques
Filtering of mobile data is typically performed on a data type level. Data is filtered by tools during
processing into groups such as communication data and media files. These groups are then further
divided; for example communication data can be divided into call records and messages. The level
of filtering presented to the analyst depends on the tool being used, however this filtering allows
analysts to quickly review key data types, such as sent and received SMS messages and call
records to establish contact between suspects.
Prosecutor's considerations
The processing stage can be of vital importance to the prosecution. Although technical
data (evidence) is very much needed, one should not forget that the complete picture of
the case is and should be with prosecutor during the investigation phase. Forensic
expert staff in the laboratory may or may not be acquainted with legal requirements, or
may or may not be part of the law enforcement. The prosecutor, on the other hand,
more often would not be specialised in questions of information and communication
technologies.
Therefore, the prosecutor should, if necessary, consult directly with the laboratory
already for provisional findings. The laboratory staff, police and prosecutors will should
cooperate to discover and understand the full picture of the case.
Often prosecutors will not have enough time to take this approach because of everyday
routines. Nevertheless, especially in more complex cases and in cases of higher public
importance, prosecutors will have to be closely involved by the prosecution. On such occasions,
should expect important and expedited decisions about the acquisition of electronic
evidence to be taken by the responsible prosecutor. In such cases it will be very
important that information presented by examiners to prosecutors about the
acquisition and actions needed includes all relevant facts in an understandable manner
indicating clearly the connection with the crime under investigation.
Expert witness status will vary from country to country. In that sense, electronic
evidence should not be regarded as more volatile or unreliable, especially having in mind
that as society, industry and technology advance, more and more of traces, facts and
evidence will exist in digital form. Therefore, admissibility of electronic evidence as real
evidence should not represent an issue for prosecutor or judiciary, provided that the
procedures described in this Guide are followed.
When evidence must establish facts and the authenticity of electronic evidence to
be examined is followed in a laboratory environment – it can be validated by going to the following URL:

The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,

The user was relatively new to computing and did not really understand much of
what was going on. For example:

By 8 out some time and on the 13 August 2004 they appear to have become annoyed with the popups their
Spyware was generating and they installed popup stopper. But given the number of
items of Spyware and the fact that many had been legitimately installed (having
duped the user), this had little chance of stopping the problem, furthermore, they
were only treating the symptoms and not the cause.
