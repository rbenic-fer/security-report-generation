defensive piece of software in the form of ‘Spyblocker’ from <www.spyblockersoftware.com>, this can be seen from the time line entries coloured blue, that

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.

The first a Virus Scan was performed using Norton Anti Virus a good produce that
the investigator is familiar with, it is configurable and it will detect Trojans, Viruses,
Worms and {as we will see only some} Malware. On this occasion it revealed one
virus called ‘polmx2.cab’ which it classed as a Trojan.

Forensic Laptop Specification

ts.

The forensic Laptop used for this examination was a Dell Inspiron 5100. The
specification of the laptop being; Intel Pentium 4 2800 MHz with 768Mb RAM, a
CDR/RW and 3com on board network card. The graphics processor was a 64 mb
Mobile ATI card with a 1024x768 TFT screen. It boasts a IEEE 1394 port as well as
2 x USB 2 ports. This laptop has more than proven itself in the past and the
performance of each of the components has been well above standard without the
need for specialist drivers. It will accept over 15 different distributions of Linux and
has run Windows from 95 – 2003 Enterprise Server. As the caddie cost in the
region of £30) the Main Forensic OS was a free distribution(FC2) and the
laptop (inc 2 extra HDD and internal caddie drives) cost £550 (~$10) the whole
forensic outfit was comparatively cheep £580 ($1085).

The only glitch that was presented was with the use of the external caddie which
connects IDE devices to either IEEE 1394 or USB2. While MS Windows was able
to address the device, Fedora Core 2 did not have any support for it in the kernel.
That said some research on the internet did reveal a patch had been submitted (see
below) which when applied allowed the external caddie to be mounted in the
Fedora Core 2 (FC2) OS in read only mode.
