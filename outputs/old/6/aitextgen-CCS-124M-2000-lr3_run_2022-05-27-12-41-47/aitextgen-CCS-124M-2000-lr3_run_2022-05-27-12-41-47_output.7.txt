While the accuracy of the documents in relation to the current company policies is
not something that the investigator would comment upon, the first 2 files listed
above were deemed larger that expected given their limited textual content. These
files were recorded as being ‘of interest’ and would be subjected to closer
examination later.
An examination was then made of the files that had been marked as deleted, this
included a CamShell.dll (probably a part of a program) and _ndex.htm
(probably an ‘Index.htm’ page from a website). The time-line shows a file was
deleted on 3rd Feb 2001 and that file was the CamShell.dll. A search of the
internet revealed a handful of newsgroups that referred to an old and now
unsupported program called Camouflage. Further searches led the investigator to
this web site located at the URL: <http://camouflage.unfiction.com>9 (pictured
below).

remembering that the zip folder also contains the installation software that will build

====================
File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  any data relating to any previously examined exhibits. If using
laboratory or cloned SIM cards, examiners must ensure that the laboratory SIM card contains the
data from the last inserted SIM card.
3.2.3 Write blocking
Due to some specific extraction techniques, such as iOS Boot loader extractions and rooting of
Android devices, it is not always possible to implement write-blocking. Where possible writeblocking should be implemented, for example the extraction of memory cards, however it is widely
acknowledged that this is only possible or practical when working with mobile devices. For
this reason it is imperative that the examiner is fully aware of the consequences of their actions
when handling mobile devices and is able to explain these actions in a coherent fashion.

Digital Forensics Guide

3.2.2 Acquisition process
It is important that, at all stages of an examination, the mobile device under scrutiny is isolated
from all external connections. A physical examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This prevents the device from altering any stored data. A physical examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This prevents the device from altering any stored data. A physical examination should be undertaken to prevent this from happening. A physical examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This is to allow a SIM/IDEN card, which is restricted to
prevent any changes in data on the device. A physical examination should be undertaken to prevent this from happening. A physical examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This is to allow a SIM/IDEN card. This is to prevent a SIM/IDEN card and a SIM/IDEN card. This will allow a SIM/IDEN card and a SIM/IDEN card. A physical examination should be undertaken to prevent this from happening. A physical examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This is due to some handsets having data stored
on a SIM/IDEN card and a physical acquisition of the memory
card to start with a Faraday Shield, a Faraday Disk or cloned SIM/IDEN cards. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should
38

Digital Forensics Guide

attempt the best level of examination should be undertaken to. If this is not
possible, the user’s PIN, password or pattern will be required prior to examination. If the PIN,
password or pattern is already known prior to examination, then this should be entered so that full
access can be gained to the device. Again, the best level of examination should be undertaken to
get the most data extracted out of the device. If obtaining the correct solution for the protection is
not possible it may be necessary to attempt typical PINs or patterns in order to access the data.
This is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one is found. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise the effect on the electronic evidence and to attempt to preserve
the integrity of the data to the highest standard possible. It is important to consider that for some
mobile devices it may be necessary to modify system files or the operating system, or in some
cases upload and install a dedicated application in the Internet Explorer or program can be undertaken without making these system changes.
3.2.5 Hardware and software
Analysis of mobile devices typically requires the use of dedicated software and the correct cable.

With the image marked as read-only in the Linux file permissions, the image was
mounted as a loop-back read only in the Linux file permissions. This
was to allow the investigator see for the first time the directory structure.

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
