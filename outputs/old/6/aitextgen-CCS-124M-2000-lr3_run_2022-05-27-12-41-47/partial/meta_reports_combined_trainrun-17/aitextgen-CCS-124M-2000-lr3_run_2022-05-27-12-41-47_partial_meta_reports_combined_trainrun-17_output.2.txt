“ hours” access in several Linux files – saving and modification. As soon as the controller
is attached to a power supply it will start to reorganise data on the flash chips. Techniques like
wear-levelling, write-amplification and garbage collection collection are common tasks that are carried out by
the controller even when attached to a write-blocking device. The only yet resource-intensive way
to create a true forensic copy of flash-media is by disordering the chip(s) from the circuit board and
then reassembles the data in the correct way where possible.
3.2.1.4 Hardware and software
There are typically two types of write-blocking methods; hardware write-blockers
on the one hand side and software write-blockers on the other. Hardware writeblockers are typically available in two different varieties; write-blocking devices
which are connected to a forensic workstation or imaging server or write-blocked
disk duplicators which image onto an attached storage medium while not being
connected to a computer system. Wherever possible hardware based writeblockers or disk duplicators should be used because they physically block write
transactions to the exhibit and work very reliable in doing so.
Software write-blockers typically involve any combination of the following
