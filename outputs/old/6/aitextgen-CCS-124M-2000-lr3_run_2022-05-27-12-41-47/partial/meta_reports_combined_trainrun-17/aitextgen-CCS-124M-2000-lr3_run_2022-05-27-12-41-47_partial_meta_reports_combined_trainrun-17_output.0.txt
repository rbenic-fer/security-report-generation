Digital Forensics Analysis Report
60

Appendix A - Forensic report must be written in clear, understandable language and
should have a summary indication in a compact format what has been found during the
examination. All technical details can be listed in an appendix. It is important that the digital
forensics analyst does not state something in the report that he cannot prove, e.g. "The suspect
has done A, B, C"; it is only possible to state "With this computer, at this point of time, using user
account XY, file A has been created, USB thumb drive B has been attached and in inbox of webmail
account C has been visited."
A digital forensics report should consist of the following main chapters:
1.

Information about the request and the mandate

2.

Information about the exhibits

3.

Information about the examination methods (persons/software/hardware)

4.

Acquisition process

5.

Analysis process

6.

Result

An exemplary layout of a report has been attached to this document in appendix J.
In the digital forensics laboratory it should be clearly defined who is responsible for the report and
who will be delivering the evidence in court. Typically that is the same person who’s name is on the
report and who signed it. In addition to that quality assurance measures should be followed before
the report is completed and submitted.

3.5.3

Expert witness status

An expert witness, professional witness or judicial expert is a witness, who by virtue of education,
training, skill, or experience, is believed to have expertise and specialised knowledge in a particular

subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially and legally rely
upon the witness's specialised (scientific, technical or other) opinion about an evidence or fact issue
within the scope of his expertise, referred to as the expert opinion, as an assistance to the factfinder. In some jurisdictions, expert status is decided on each and every case by the trial judge and
the person is only an expert in that case. In other jurisdictions, expert status has a more long
lasting status, by virtue of appointment as, for example a court expert.3

Appendix A – Comparison of forensic software
All appendices in section A are templates and should aid laboratory managers to develop their own comparison matrix in order to make an educated decision about software, hardware
and training purchases. In some tables, exemplary data are provided by one Det.
Analyst work station - The digital forensics analyst will require a large desk for
each exhibits and sensitive data. It should also be advisable to position the desks to avoid others from

accidentally viewing sensitive data on the screens – or put privacy screens between the
workstations to provide a cubicle type environment.
Server room – The space allocated to central server will need to be secure due to the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room for resilience like UPS.

2.5.1

Software and hardware

Hardware - The digital forensic laboratory should be a high tech environment with lots of sensitive
data being analysed and stored. As such, it will require an examination network, which is isolated
from any external connections. As all laboratory staff will use this network it will need to be
resilient, secure and fast. When setting up any server or system, best practice would be to opt for
the highest available processing power buttons and to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory. It will need to have an area away from their
laboratory and if available, a separate room.

2.5.2

Software and hardware

Hardware - The digital forensic laboratory should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.

Office equipment

The size of any laboratory will require an examination network, which is isolated
from any external connections. As all laboratory staff will use this network it will need to have
an storage facility or climate control system (e.g. an storage server).

3.3.2

 storage media

Analysing a computer system is important to have a storage facility to store backups of the
computer's storage media. As soon as the forensic laboratory staff will use
a computer system for a physical
