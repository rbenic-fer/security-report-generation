In a typical Windows system the followingDuring the next stages of the
time line becomes corrupt. few UNIX flavours of the time line are clear or
logical. As seen above, absent
backdating or manipulation of the system clock, it is not possible for a file’s last printed
date to post-date its last modification date. Therefore, this document was fabricated on
or after February 15, 2011 at 8:35 AM (MST). A creation of the time line was found in the form of
dfingerze which typically arise when parts of the system was copied. Therefore, this document was fabricated on
or after February 15, 2011 at 8:35 AM (MST). That date was years after the Work for Hire Document wasallegedly signed and signed by the investigator.

The failure of the hard disk – either its hardware or its logical structure did present
significant problems for the forensic investigator. Furthermore, using a system
obtained in this manner was a risk, as the disk may have been completely clean,
well maintained ie with little meat for the report or loaded with child pornography or
images
of that nature.

The forensic workstation image was re-ghosted to the laptop and all respective

All products were updated remotely via removable media and therefore, had never
been connected to the internet; thus they can be judged to be judged to be forensically and
operationally sound in that they will represent accurately all data they process and
display. The image of the laptop has been retained for future use and reference
should it be required.
Autopsy (v1.70) and The Sleuth Kit were then loaded to perform various analyses on

(TSK), the newer version (v2.03) of Autopsy could not be loaded onto the Forensics
System (lib failure with Fedora Core 2 (FC2)). TSK is a collection of command line
tools that have been adapted and modified from their original release in the form of
‘The Coroner’s Toolkit7 (TCT). Autopsy is a graphical front end to TSK that uses perl
to interprets the user’s actions and builds the TSK commands in the background.
The user interface is via a standard web browser but output is graphical with logs,
recovered files, md5 hashes, timeline output etc being stored in a user definable
mounted file structure. All these tools are available from <www.sleuthkit.org>.
