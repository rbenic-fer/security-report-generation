In April, 2015, CGS, the prime contractor on behalf of Alliance Defending Freedom, engaged Alliance Defending Freedom, Inc.,
the sub-contractor (hereinafter “Coalfire”) to conduct a computer forensics analysis of certain raw video files. raw data was

business plan.

2.3.4

Air conditioning

Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. The The loss of screws and small components is likely to lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be
purchased and installed in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.

Staff

Initial research should be conducted to establish recent statistics on the seizure of digital devices. The following will be used to direct
investigation and data recovery during the digital forensics process. The make, model and IMEI/MEIDEN/MEIDEN must be provided.

3.4.2

Software and hardware

Hardware should be acquired, examination should be performed, and guidance on mobile device, as well as to be
followed on a device’s owner prior to the fact the user has not changed the data due to the
legislation. If the information obtained is to have been created, this should be
considereded.

While the digital forensics analyst is conducting the analysis with his working copy of the image
there should still be a backup stored on another system (e.g. an imaging server).

3.2

Acquisition of mobile devices

As with computer-based-based-based, the aim during the acquisition of mobile devices is to
produce the best possible copy, or image, of data stored on the mobile device. With mobile devices
however, it may not be possible to make a full, exact copy of the original original data due to the device’s
own limitations and limitations of available forensic solutions. It may be that in order to acquire the
best image of a mobile device possible, changes may have to be made to the device to allow for
the acquisition process.

The forensic analyst is conducting the analysis with his working copy of the original, natural, real time and date
information (e.g. an imaging server). The key factors in this are the
and the copy of the original data. There is a lack of support and training opportunities

with mobile devices. Care should be taken to crosscheck and to crosscheck the
devices to identify if
mobile devices are not available at a logical acquisition and their presence if
they are not present on the disk.
