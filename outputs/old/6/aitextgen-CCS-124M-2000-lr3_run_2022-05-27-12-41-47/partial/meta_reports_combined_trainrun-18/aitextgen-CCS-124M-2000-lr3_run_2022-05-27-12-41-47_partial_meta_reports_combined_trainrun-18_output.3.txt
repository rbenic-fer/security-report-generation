Operating System use is a classic home user one.

The system was a reasonable specification and in business would most

Key areas and direction for Detailed Analysis

It is important when performing any detailed task to have both objectives and
direction otherwise time and effort can be wasted proving points that are not
relevant or of value to the investigation. The following will be used to direct
investigation and data recovery during the next stage. The success and
performance of the forensic examination and analysis will be gauged against these
objectives.

Prosecutor's considerations
The analysis stage is of the vital importance for identification and acquisition of
evidence used for the investigation and trial phases of criminal proceedings. One of the
most important things to be considered should be cataloguing of the steps and evidence
which is gathered and secured.
Often evidence will be present in great numbers and their bulleting and listing can be
time consuming. Nevertheless, one must be persistent in this process having in mind
that this approach will lead to a logical explanation of the chain of evidence and the
criminal act itself.
The interpretation of the evidence must be taken very seriously and its importance well
understood. Forensic staff must be aware they will be summoned by the court and be in
a position to explain their procedures and findings in detail; their statements will be
examined both by the prosecution and defence, and, and, and, depending on the
acquisition system, are all times and date informationlog files, and
un methods are all times used for the analysis phase.
The analysis of the evidence should lead to clear and logical conclusions which should be
able to sustain significant examination during the trial.

Presentation stage

After evidence has been found in the analysis stage, the examiner needs to create a report for the
trial. The examiner’s job is to illustrate and to translate complicated technical contexts into facts
that judges, prosecutors and other parties involved can easily understand. They may also be
expected to interpret those facts and to express an opinion on their meaning.

3.5.1

Admissibility of electronic evidence

Although the details may differ from to jurisdiction to jurisdiction (some might even not admit
electronic evidence at all), the following criteria should generally be taken into account when
evaluating electronic evidence for trial:
Authenticity: The evidence must establish facts in a way that cannot be disputed and is
representative of its original state.
Completeness: The analysis of or any opinion based on the evidence must tell the whole
story and not be tailored to match a more favourable or desired perspective.

and subsequently handled that may cast doubt on its
