This report is  CI to the lead investigator, Det. JONES.
In the digital forensics laboratory it should be clearly defined who is responsible for the report and
who will be delivering the evidence in court. Typically that is the same person who’s name is on the
report and who signed it. In addition to that quality assurance measures should be followed before
the report is completed and submitted.

Expert witness status

An expert witness, professional witness or judicial expert is a witness, who by virtue of education,
training, skill, or experience, is believed to have expertise and specialised knowledge in a particular

subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially and legally rely
upon the witness's specialised (scientific, technical or other) opinion about an evidence or fact issue
within the scope of his expertise, referred to as the expert opinion, as an assistance to the factfinder. In some jurisdictions, expert status is decided on each and every case by the trial judge and
the person is only an expert in that case. In other jurisdictions, expert status has a more long
lasting status, by virtue of appointment as, for example a court expert.3
Evidence involving complex issues of science and technology plays an increasing role in litigation.
That is why some countries and courts maintain lists of appointed experts. Appointing an expert is
often suggested as a means for the court to enhance its ability to deal with such issues. 4
The rights and duties of an expert witness typically differ from country to country. It is important
for the digital forensics analysts to make themselves familiar with their legislation, their court
procedures, their role and their rights and duties in that role.

3.5.4

Alternative presentation methods

Some courts allow the usage of alternative presentation methods. Those can include explanatory
media such as live demonstrations on computers with projectors, virtual machines, etc. If wanted,
accepted and necessary, it is vital to discuss those possibilities with the judge before the hearing.
It is also very important to be confident in the usage of those techniques and to have tested them
before the hearing.
