In September, 2015, CGS, the prime contractor on behalf of Alliance Defending Freedom, engaged Coalfire Systems, Inc.,
the sub-contractor (hereinafter “Coalfire”) to conduct a computer forensics analysis of certain raw video and audio data
files. Coalfire’s objectives for this project are to:
-

Forensically evaluate video and audio files provided by The Center for Medical Progress (“the Organization believes”)
through CGS (“raw/01 video recording at 13:48 (UTC - available from the Company”).
Depending on the authenticity of the [Work for Hire Document] attached to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails), Coalfire was able to obtain a full analysis of the content data displayed on the device.

A).

1 – data integrity
No action taken should materially change any data, electronic device or media which may

subsequently be used as evidence in court.
Principle 2 – Audit trail
A record of all actions taken when handling electronic evidence should be created and preserved so
that they can be subsequently audited. An independent third party should not only be able to
repeat those facts and could also be

Principle 3 – Specialist support
If it is expected that the person scoping and preparing the business case will be the laboratory manager
or will be involved in the recruitment of such a Manager. Best practice shows that the laboratory
manager should be involved in the recruiting of the staff that will be employed to carry

Overall process model

In situations where location data was collected while the seized computer was still running (as
described in chapter 3.2.1.2.4) the medium was aim of the investigation. The forensics analyst
can search for those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst

can search for further evidence of when those documents have been produced, by which user they
have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons; however, the majority of the time

they can include communication channels, which can be utilised as they can be easily manipulated due to built-in checksums and
case metadata. The most common formats are the Expert Witness Format (EWF(x)/E(x)01) and
the Advanced Forensic Format (AFF). They include features like:


Compression of data



Encryption of data



Error-Checks



Case Metadata



Hash sums



Splitting the image in chunks

In addition to that, different forensic software solutions come with their own propitiatory image
formats with similar features. However, a forensic image format should be chosen that is supported
by the largest variety of software.
Special attention should be given to the image format when the image is to be analysed in a
different forensic laboratory which might use different forensic software. This is especially
important when the investigation involves multiple jurisdictions.

In the later stages of the digital forensics process all further processing and analysis is typically
