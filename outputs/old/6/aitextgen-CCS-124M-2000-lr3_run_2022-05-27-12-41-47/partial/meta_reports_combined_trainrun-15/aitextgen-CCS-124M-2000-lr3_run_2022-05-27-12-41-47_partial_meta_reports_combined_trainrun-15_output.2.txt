The contents of a digital storage medium can be of evidential data. An example can
be the “Start” menu and the whether the
user’s system is the same.
In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage of non-evidential equipment like media
copiers, media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, tags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
The building or office selected should be large enough to expand if there is an anticipated increase
in demand for digital forensic investigation.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility.
Many existing digital forensics facilities have found it necessary to relocate or expand in a short
space ofspace of data. An example can be browser hijacker technical server – this may be stored securely within the
laboratory and if available, consult directly with the laboratory
already for provisional findings.

Air conditioning

Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be
purchased and installed in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.

Staff

It is likely that the person scoping and preparing the business case will be the laboratory manager
or will be involved in the recruitment of such a Manager. Best practice shows that the laboratory
manager should be involved in the recruiting of the staff that will carry out the
different roles within the laboratory.
Depending on the size of the laboratory and the required number of staff they must consider the
different functions that are required. Staff roles and responsibilities will need to be documented and
detailed job descriptions should be prepared so that each member of the team has a clear
understanding of their job profile. Where possible the structure of a digital forensics capability
