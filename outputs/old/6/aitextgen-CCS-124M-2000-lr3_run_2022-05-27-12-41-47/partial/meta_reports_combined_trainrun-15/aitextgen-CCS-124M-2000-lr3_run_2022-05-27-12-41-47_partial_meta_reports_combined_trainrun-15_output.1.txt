In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage of non-evidential equipment like media
copiers, media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, tags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
The building or office selected should be large enough to expand if there is an anticipated increase
in demand for digital forensic investigation.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility.
Many existing digital forensics facilities have found it necessary to relocate or expand in a short
space ofspace of time due to exponential increases in workload. The information gathered during the
research phase will give a good idea of the likely need for future expansion. It is extremely
expensive to relocate or expand, so it may be beneficial to provide room for expansion in the initial
business plan plan plan.

Air conditioning

Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be
purchased and installed in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence, as
documented to the can be seen in close conjunction with computers.Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be

Staff

It is likely that the person scoping and preparing the business case will be the laboratory manager
or will be involved in the recruitment of such a Manager. Best practice shows that the laboratory
manager should be involved in the recruiting of the staff that will be employed to carry out the
different roles
