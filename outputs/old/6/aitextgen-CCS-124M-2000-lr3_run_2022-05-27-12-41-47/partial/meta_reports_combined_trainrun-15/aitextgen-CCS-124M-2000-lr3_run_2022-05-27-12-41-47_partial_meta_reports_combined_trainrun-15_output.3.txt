 and date stamps are typically fast paced and stressful. When dealing with encryption a number of obtained files it is common that is one second behind the time

Coalfire used a Logicube Falcon to create a raw DD image of the evidence onto a previously wiped hard drive. The
images were verified by their hash values. A working copy of the original image was created onto a previously wiped
hard drive. All subsequent analysis was performed on the working copy forensic image, not on the original media or the
original forensic image acquisition. The analysis was performed on a dedicated forensic workstation using AccessData’s
Forensic Toolkit (FTK) version 5.6.3.16, VLC Player version 2.2.1
