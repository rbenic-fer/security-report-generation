Next a file timeline was created from all Allocated and Unallocated space on the
drive including the Unallocated Meta Data structures. This would show the order in
which files were created, modified and deleted. The file was created by Autopsy
and as the ‘output/body’ file was created an md5 hash of the file was also written to
the working folder (/forensics Laboratory. The final step for this
item was to create the time-line file from the body with a start and end point. As
Floppy disk contained small amounts of data a complete timeline was requested
and this was saved as ‘output/total-timeline’.

The timeline would be later analysed and referred to as a key reference document,
indicating file activity and user actions. As the timeline related to a floppy disk the
activity recorded would primarily be that of the user as systems are rarely able to
page or record system activity to the media (limited volume size, slow read and
write speed coupled with a lack of system pre-notification as to its removal) and would also be
 format it held in any media cards.

Conclusion

Digital Forensics Guide

most commonly used hash algorithms are MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256. Since single hash algorithms
can be subject to hash collisions it is advised to use at least two hash algorithms to verify the
copy/image.
It is good practise that hash verifications are done at two points at the imaging process. The first
hash calculation should be done at the beginning of the imaging process in order to produce the
hash value of the original medium. The second hash calculation should be done at the end of the
imaging process. This second calculation should be done on both the original medium as well as the
copy/image in order to prove that a) the data on the original medium has not changed during the
imaging process and b) the data on the copy/image is exactly the same as on the original. In the
forensic imaging formats the calculated hash sum is typically stored in the metadata area of the
image. It can then be used in the later stages of the analysis to verify that the data in the image
that is to be analysed is still the same as the data that has been acquired.
Even if the hash based verification returns a positive result, the digital forensics analyst should still
pre-examine the data to ensure it looks authentic and does not exhibit any traits suggesting that
the data may have been modified or tampered with before or during the imaging process. Devices
can be self-encrypted or they can have a layer of protection that only allows communication when
the device is attached to a certain trusted platform. Imaging such devices can produce a valid
hash-verification even though the data that have been copied are not usable for a forensic analysis.
Please note that hash verification for solid-state drives and flash-media that has its own controller
will most likely fail because the controller of the medium might have changed the data while
connected to a power supply.
3.2.1.9 Copy storage / archiving / data retention
A forensic laboratory needs to have a storage facility to store backups of the forensic
copies/images. It is good practice to not only have one backup but also another off-site backup.
While the digital forensic analyst is conducting the analysis with his working copy of the image
there should still be a backup stored on another system (e.g. an imaging server).
