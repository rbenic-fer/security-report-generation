Digital Forensics Analysis Report
Overview.
 1 of the biggest challenges is to make the report understandable for
non-technical people. So a forensic report must be written in clear, understandable language and
should have a summary indication in a compact format what has been found during the
examination. All technical details can be listed in an appendix. It is important that the digital
forensics analyst does not state something in the report that he cannot prove, e.g. "The suspect
has done A, B, C"; it
manipulation.
In the digital forensics laboratory it is only possible to state "With this computer, at this point of time, using user
account XY, file A has been created, USB thumb drive B has been attached and in inbox of webmail
account C has been visited."
A digital forensics report should consist of the following main chapters:

attention to the other information that could be obtained from the machine being examined
and produced for the officer to review. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Strozczynski
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg has followed the terms of the Protocol for all data found on the Ceglia
Media and any other data subject to the Protocol during its analysis, including the

An exemplary layout of a report has been attached to this document in appendix J.
In the digital forensics laboratory it should be clearly defined who is responsible for the report and
who will be delivering the evidence in court. Typically that is the same person who’s name is on the
report and who signed it. In addition to that quality assurance measures should be followed before
the report is completed and submitted.
