During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.

Item 37 – Quote from Microsoft explaining the HDD ID Tag

You might also see the OEM ID "MSWIN4.0" on disks formatted by
Windows 95 and "MSWIN4.1" on disks formatted by Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2), Windows 98, and Windows Me. Windows XP
Professional does not use the OEM ID field in the boot sector except for
verifying NTFS volumes.

Therefore, it is assumed that the hard disk was formatted with either Windows 95
(OSR2), Windows 98 or Windows ME. Whilst it is not impossible for this to be a
production system, this latest fact would more than hint to a personal user.

With the image marked as read-only in the Linux file permissions, the image was
mounted as a loop-back read only device in the /mnt/unknown directory. This
was to allow the investigator see for the first time the directory structure.
Additionally, as both the mount command and the Linux file permissions were set to
read-only, browsing could be undertaken without fear of altering the data.
