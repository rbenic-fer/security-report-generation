The purpose of the first and main point of call when examining a windows system is the registry. The registry, in Windows 98, quit embryonic was quit embryonic when compared to the likes of
Windows XP, with its separate user logons and permissions. When Microsoft was designing
Windows 98 they assumed the person sat in front of the system was authorised to
see and access all data. In modern IT Security terms it was a dedicated operating
system. As a result there is no ability to discern the particular users at any set time
other than by their actual activity and behaviour. There is no logon security on
Windows 98, the login process it simply for network shares and to prevent other
users seeing each others desktops (laughable as there was no file security from
preventing them from navigating to the files and desktop directory once ‘logged on’.
