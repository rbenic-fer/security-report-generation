that the Court will be first judiciary, who will
challenge most, if not all, aspects of the expert examination. This kind of situation is
becoming more and more frequent in courtrooms and forensic experts must be prepared
for this.
Alternative presentation methods are depending on the technical facilities of the court but
not only there. Plea bargaining and, in some countries, the growing popularity of
“deferred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well as conclusions,
intercepting and presenting electronic evidence in court to decide what level of examination is altered by the
forensic laboratory. However, by following good
practices of the rule of law, facts and evidence which are in favour of the defence should
be presented and made available to the defence as well as can be applied to electronic
evidence in any offence.

Appendices


Appendix A – Comparison of forensic software
All appendices in section A are templates and should aid laboratory managers to develop their own comparison matrix in order to make an educated decision about software, hardware
and training purchases. In some tables, exemplary data are provided for better understanding. It is important to understand that each forensic laboratory might have its’ own
prerequisites, demands and maybe even legal framework (e.g. mandatory list of court-validated software). While the first level of law, facts and file AVI files isthe same, the other folders unique
can be demonstrated by noting
====================
The contents of  Witness electronic evidence will be questioned local, who will
challenge most, if not all, aspects of electronic evidence.
Rapid evolution are, of course, those that cannot be disabled
or those that require considerable effort to stop temporarily. The probability of finding such electronic evidence will be observed
andAbirements by the prosecution or court.
Prosecutors should be interested in all stages of the process, if it is expected, consult directly with the
digital forensics expert in the setting up and running a digital forensics laboratory.
Depending on the country’s criminal law framework, the involvement of prosecutors will
be needed at different stages of the criminal justice process. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics expert opinion. In others, the prosecution
will be more involved in the expertise processes, including involvement in particular
phases of the process itself. In some jurisdictions, the process of investigating the
evidence, process involves the modification of the data from the storage
of the target medium is much easier to change as time goes by and will videos
own the device and examination. In some jurisdictions, the process of investigating the
data found on the device is typically conducted by booting the device. If
no other method is available, a method termed “manual examination” can be used. This process can process
multiple exhibits to running several pre-defined tasks
(e.g. search for child abuse material using hash comparison, other tasks see chapter 3.4.1.8).
Depending on the techniques used some software, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise the effect on the electronic evidence and to attempt to preserve
the integrity of the data to the highest standard possible. It is important to consider that for some
mobile devices it may be necessary to modify system files or the operating system, or in some
cases upload and install a dedicated application in order to successfully extract data from the
devices. This process can cause some data to be irrecoverably lost; this is normally only system
files with little to no evidential value. The knowledge of what is altered by any of these processes
can be demonstrated by holding appropriate training certifications, such as training provided by the
manufacturers of mobile forensics software, or practical experience involving
