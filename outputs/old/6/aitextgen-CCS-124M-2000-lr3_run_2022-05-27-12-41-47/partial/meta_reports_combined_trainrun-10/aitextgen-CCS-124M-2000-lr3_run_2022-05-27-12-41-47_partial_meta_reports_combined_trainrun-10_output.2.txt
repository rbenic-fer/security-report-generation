The creation of the time line was the next objective. This would show the creation,
modification and access times (MAC) for all current files. It would also obtain from
the meta data the MACs for the files that have been deleted, this is less accurate as
the meta data deteriorates when parts of the disk are reused. However, as we
believe the system, the system was a home PC that may have been used by a business, some

Analysed. The hashes from items 13, 16 and 23 should be searched for on
