It is important when performing any detailed task to have both objectives and
direction otherwise time and effort can be wasted proving points that are not
relevant or of value to the investigation. The following will be used to direct
investigation and data recovery during the next stage. The success and
performance of the forensic examination and analysis will be gauged against these
objectives.
