Key areas and direction for Detailed Analysis

©

It is important when performing any detailed task to have both objectives and
direction otherwise time and effort can be wasted proving points that are not
relevant or of value to the investigation. The following will be used to direct
investigation and data recovery during the next stage. The success and
performance of the forensic examination and analysis will be gauged against these
objectives.

This report is................................................ require a digital forensic analysis, as well as a scope of his workstations and
the digital forensics analyst should be able to advance within the organisation, rather than
leaving. It is accepted that this is only possible within a facility with plentiful resources, however it
should always be an aim. There is strong anecdotal evidence that shows in many digital forensics
laboratories highly qualified staff spend much of their time undertaking mundane tasks below their
level of capability. To avoid this, it is important to recognise the activities to be undertaken should
be clearly defined in the job profiles. The roles and responsibilities that should be considered
include the following:
Laboratory manager
The laboratory manager should have some advanced technical knowledge and a strong understanding of the
legislative requirements for electronic evidence as well as the procedures and processes to be
followed. It is vital that the manager understands the overarching principles described in the
Electronic Evidence Guide and reiterated earlier on in these operating processes. The laboratory
manager should have control over the original set up, identifying the building, purchasing
equipment and software and setting the procedures and functions of the laboratory. They should be
responsible for leading the recruiting, training, mentoring, counselling and guidance of everybody
employed within the unit. They should be

employed within the unit.
Digital forensics analyst - computers
The analysts will require technical knowledge, and where possible appropriate qualifications. Ideally
they should have some training in the use of digital forensic software. Alternately these staff
members will require specific forensic training to bring them up to a suitable skill level. Digital
forensic analysts must have knowledge of legislation and be aware of legislation
and points to prove criminal action. They will be less likely to move onto other job opportunities
and will be more used to working unsociable hours.
Digital forensics analyst – mobile devices
The analysts will require technical knowledge, and where possible appropriate qualifications. Ideally
they should have some training in the use of mobile device acquisition. Alternately these staff
members will require specific training to bring them up to a suitable skill level. Digital forensic
