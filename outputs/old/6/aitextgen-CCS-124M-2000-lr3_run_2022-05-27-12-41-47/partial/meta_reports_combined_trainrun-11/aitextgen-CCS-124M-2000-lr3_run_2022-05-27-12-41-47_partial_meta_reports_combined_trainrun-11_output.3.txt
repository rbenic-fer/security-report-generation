File Timings Explained
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when they are Modified, Accessed or Created
(called MAC times).

creation and modification but only date information on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, modify it on the 2nd Nov, modify it on the 3rd Nov and copy it
onto separate media on the 4th; when the MACs are viewed on the 5th
however, it will appear to have been accessed and modified before it was
created.

As will be explained in the next section, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained the MAC times of the original carried files. Thus
when the carried files are exported from the carrier file a new instance is
written to the new media and although this will have a different creation time
again, it will retain the original accessed and modification times.

Finally, vi is used to display the contents of the command.com file as this would be
used to start a command shell and MS Windows OS always reports the host OS at
the top of any new shell. The screenshot below confirms the presence of a
Windows 9820 installation.

operated under before disposal was conducted. The key factors in this are the files
and directory structure, the OS, the systems hardware and the manner and style of
disposal. The assessment is split into factors for the business use and factors for
verifying NTFS volumes.

Business type case (ie tower).
Electrical Safety Check sticker on the case, would indicate a Health and
Safety requirement for the system owner to ensure the system being able to deal with
tampering with such issues.

Personal Use:

Operating System use is a classic home user one.
The age of the operating system (6 years) would indicate it was a outright
purchase and not on contract for regular or frequent updating.
3.
The system was a reasonable specification and in business would most
likely have been reused for some other task as it met the min spec for
Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2003 Server and XP Pro (or home).
However, given the current specification of home systems is would be
considered dated and limited.

The Team17 folder would indicate the presence of a system that had been used on the computer
those artefacts are stored in various locations. The initial ‘one off’
folder would indicate the presence of a system.

The system was the removed from the facility and returned to an examination area
(investigators garage)where it was catalogued and photographed.
