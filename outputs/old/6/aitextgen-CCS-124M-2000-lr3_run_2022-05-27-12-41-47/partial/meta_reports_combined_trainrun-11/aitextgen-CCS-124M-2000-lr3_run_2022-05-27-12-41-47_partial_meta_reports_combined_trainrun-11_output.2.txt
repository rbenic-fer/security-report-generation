A cursory examination of this the root of the system, would confirm the file
identification of the early personal edition of Windows. Files like the
autoexec.bat and config.sys are not used on windows NT (any version) and
the FAT32 file structure was not readable by NT. In order that we might learn the
install date of the operating system the ls command was executed with the ‘ -abo ’
switches. These have the effect of displaying (taken from the ls manual):

This produced the following output:

The contents of........................................................, referred to as “Rooting” the device. This forensic software suites will store the original MAC times from the device’s
files. If the device is not isolated and allowed to
connect to external networks, data may be changed on the device. One example is that it is possible to remotely wipe
some mobile devices.
The forensic software suites can usually
parse different types of electronic evidence for different traces. different types of electronic evidence is different processing
time consuming, specific software can be used. different types of electronic evidence will typically
be identical and in different file types. These formats can typically be transfer between different tools to leverage the
strengths of different decoding abilities. different types of reports will typically be different depending on the device and on the settings of the
devices.
Consideration must also be aware that not many prosecutors and even a smaller
number of judges feel comfortable with cybercrime, electronic evidence, digital forensics
reports and similare, and that in many cases the natural reaction is to reject the facts; in
this case, such issues should be more thoroughly explained in person during the expert
testimony. Forensic experts must be prepared and flexible on such occasions.
Te expert witness status will vary from country to country. In some systems, experts are
engaged by the prosecution and defence, in some systems they are court-appointed, and
there is number of mixed systems in which all parties and the court alike can appoint or
hire expert at different stages of the proceedings.
However, it is a very likely scenario that expert witness coming from the forensics
laboratory of the state authority will be engaged by the prosecution or court. This also

means that the defence is likely to engage expert witnesses of their own, who will
challenge most, if not all, aspects of the expert examination. This kind of situation is
becoming more and more frequent in courtrooms and forensic experts must be prepared
for this.
Alternative presentation methods are depending on the technical facilities of the court but
not only there. Plea bargaining and, in some countries, the growing popularity of
“deferred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
court and prosecution rooms are not equipped
