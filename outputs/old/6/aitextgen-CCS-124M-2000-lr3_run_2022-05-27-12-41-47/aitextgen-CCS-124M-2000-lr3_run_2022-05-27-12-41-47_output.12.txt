3.2.6 Levels of examination
There are two different levels of examination for mobile devices, with the best possible extraction
being listed first:




File System Dump (FSDS), Computer Forensic Tool Catalog

https://www.dell.com/Cugu/awesome-Scan



This software will store a suspect’s browsing history as well as details of his or her downloads, form
inputs, cookies, etc., but can either be disabled or deleted by the suspect. Another example can
be the “Start’ menu and the suspect’s Office programs that ‘remember’ which files the suspect has
opened recently. There are various types of ‘avoidable’ traces automatically stored on the hard disk
in this way (as shown in the table below). However, they can be prevented by someone who knows
what they are doing.
Unavoidable traces: By contrast, unavoidable traces are, of course, those that cannot be disabled
or those that require considerable effort to stop temporarily. The probability of finding such traces
is correspondingly high even if a suspect has tried to cover his or her tracks.

3.4.1.2 Procedures for different traces
Every case typically involves some particularly relevant traces. In a fraud case for example
documents, spreadsheets and e-mails are typically more relevant while in child-abuse cases
pictures, videos and communication traces are more relevant. But even within those categories of
cases not every case is the same. That is why the following subchapters included information on
procedures based on the type of type that is relevant rather than the type of case.
3.4.1.1

E-Mails

To analyse e-mail communication it is not only important to analyse mail clients like Outlook,
Thunderbird or Mail but also webmail accounts. The former will be covered in this subchapter while
the latter will be covered in section 3.4.1.2.4.
In order to analyse an e-mail client it is important to know which artefact that e-mail client
produces. Outlook for example stores evidential data in personal folder files such as PST, OST and
PAB files while Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files. The forensic software suites can usually
parse those files. However, they do not necessarily extract all messages. Some forensic tools, for
example, have problems extracting deleted messages from personal folder files.
3.4.1.2

Office documents

In cases in which office documents are of importance the digital forensics analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst should

can search for further evidence of when those documents have been produced, by which user they
have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons.

The first and main point of call when examining a windows system is the registry.
The registry in Windows 98 was quit embryonic when compared to the likes of
Windows XP, with its separate user logons, separate data storage area and even
separate software installs and permissions. When Microsoft was designing
Windows 98 they assumed the person sat in front of the system was authorised to
see and access all data. In modern IT Security terms it was a dedicated operating system and there was no single
media of the business case, which required an image of a floppy disk to
be analysed and a significant part thereof. The image of the digital operating system (warrant) was to
be analysed and a report submitted based upon the contents.

containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date and time at which computer activity, such as the creation or modification
of documents, occurred. Backdating can be accomplished by setting the system clock
on a computer hard drive to an earlier date, such that activity that occurs on the hard
drive while the computer is in a backdated state will appear to have occurred at that
earlier time.
