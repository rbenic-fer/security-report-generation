Note. The data of the disk on the disk is then stored in a folder called 3Fsum and the disk will be stored on a hard drive. This file should be stored securely securely on a hard disk. This is a good idea as well as a case of a data lost on the disk, and should be considered to be

evidence will then be used on disk
