This report is  Cellular to the conclusion that
the information extracted from the report is eitherA169 or not, e.g., any digital device used by the examiner could be remotely (and securely) wiped or deleted.  Although quality assurance is not expected, an
investigation approach is not possible for a forensic report to available evidence that facts have been produced.
3.5.1

Report writing

The digital forensics report reflects all the procedures and procedures that typically are involved in a digital forensics
examination. An overall, chronological process model is used in order to provide a better overview
over the main processes.
During all phases of a digital forensics examination it is vital to remember the special
characteristics of electronic evidence as laid out in the Electronic Evidence Guide.
Electronic evidence...
... is invisible to the untrained eye: Electronic evidence is often found in places where
only specialists would search or in locations reachable only by means of special tools.
... is highly volatile: On some devices and under certain conditions computer memory
(and the evidence it contains) can be overwritten (or altered) by the usual functioning or
operation of the device. This might be caused, for instance, by a loss of power or where
the system needs to lay (or ‘write’) new information over the top of the old due to lack of
memory space. Computer memory can also be corrupted or lost through environmental
factors such as excessive heat or humidity or through the presence of electromagnetic
fields.
... may be altered or destroyed through normal use: Computer devices constantly
change the state of their memories, be it on user request (“save this document”, “copy
this file”) or automatically by the computer operating system (“allocate space for this
program”, “temporarily store information to swap it between devices”).
... can be copied without degradation: Digital information can be copied indefinitely
with each copy exactly the same as the original. This unique attribute means that multiple
copies of the evidence can be examined independently and in parallel by different
specialists for different reasons without affecting the original.
Please remember that this manual is not intended to be used as a step-by-step set of instructions.
While it describes processes and procedures and provides indications of what should be considered
in all phases of a digital forensics analysis, it does not explain which features of a certain software
need to used or where exactly and in which format certain artefacts from all operating systems and
applications need to be parsed.
In addition to the explanatory text a number of useful resources have been created in order to
visually aid in the faster understanding and remembering of the processes and procedures.
Prosecutor's considerations
Criminal procedure and substantive law vary through countries and continents. The
usual division between “common law” and “civil law” criminal justice systems still exists,
but the borderline is becoming less visible and hybrid systems emerge as time goes by
and practitioners all over the world are demanding more unified and, above all, more
expedited systems for criminal justice.
The position and role of prosecutors in a contemporary criminal justice system becomes
more prominent. In most systems prosecutors are bridging points between suppression
and litigation, between discovery and adjudication of criminal acts, and between the
police and other law enforcement agencies as well as judges and courts.
Taking that into account, processes and procedures in the forensics laboratory may or
may not be under scrutiny of the public or state prosecutor, but one thing should always
28

Digital Forensics Guide

be on the mind of laboratory staff: facts discovered and evidence produced is always
going to end in the hands of a prosecutors who will be responsible to render lawful
decisions about the fate of the case and it’s perpetrator.
The aim of the investigation should always be two-fold: acquisition of all existing
evidence with regards to the case, and ability to reproduce and explain the forensic
procedures which led to the acquisition.
Prosecutors should be interested in all stages of the process, but they will most
probably focus on the acquisition and presentation stages.
On some occasions, the acquisition stage will be the first encounter of the prosecutor
with the electronic evidence in a criminal case. Often, this contact will happen during
the on call duty and maybe during late hours. With an increasing role of prosecutors
within criminal law systems, they are in charge of decision making throughout the
whole investigation process or a significant part thereof. Thus, a forensic examiner
should expect important and expedited decisions about the acquisition of electronic
evidence to be taken by the responsible prosecutor. In such cases it will be very
important that information presented by examiners to prosecutors

Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
