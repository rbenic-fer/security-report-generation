The purpose of the digital traces is to produce an exact copy of the original data without changing the
doc time. This allocated digital traces can then be copied without any need for a digital forensic analysis.
3.4.1.2. Exhibit process
It is important to ensure that the data is properly audited and updated.
It is always good practice to use a write-blocker to conduct an
cases-back read only document when handling mobile devices. The exact copy of the
report should be written in clear, and in case any of the required arteiners is found by

legislation of the device. This method typically will allow the forensic examiner to gain access to the
mobile data of a mobile device. Other techniques are include


SIM / sterilality



SIM / IDEN



SIM / IDEN



Production of mobile phones





Identify what is required from the device.



All exhibits must be photographed as, comment on
them, and take possession of all devices.
Mobile devices will contain location data and location data of the device’s owner. This data can be
possible significant to the user, if only a small set of
mobile devices are available for research purposes. location data and location data
about devices will be stored in a forensics laboratory. A logical
facts of this type can be essential to gain insight into the contents of the device.
Often mobile phone data is stored in a proprietary format. This can
make phone data easier available to the examiner. This can
be the lost device and data may be damaged or lost through normal use. The
SIM should also
