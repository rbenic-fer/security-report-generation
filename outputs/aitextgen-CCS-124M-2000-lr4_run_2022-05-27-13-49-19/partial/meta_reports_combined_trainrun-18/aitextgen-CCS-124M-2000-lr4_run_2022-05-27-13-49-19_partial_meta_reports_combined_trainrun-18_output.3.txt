====================
Conclusion

If the aim of the investigation was two-fold, to obtain all existing and qualitative evidence
with regard to the case and to be able to reproduce and explain forensic procedures which
led to the acquisition, the trial phase is the one confirming the quality or lack of quality of
the acquired evidence.
Admissibility of evidence represents the key outcome of the digital forensic process.
Prosecutors and judges are becoming increasingly comfortable with the existence and
admission of such electronic evidence. In some jurisdictions, not only is it that electronic
evidence is explicitly allowed by the criminal justice, but there are references and
definitions of computers, computer networks, software and data in substantive
and procedural parts of the legal framework. Also, in some jurisdictions, computer data is
defined as a movable object, to which all legal rules for tangible items can apply
(destruction, alteration, theft, alienation, exchange, etc.).
Some legal opinions about electronic evidence may consider it non-usable because of the
possibility of alteration and forgery. Under this logic, any other evidence could be
questioned as well. Forgeries of paper documents are widespread. Fingerprint forgery,
alteration of photographic, video and audio materials is common. In that sense, electronic
evidence should not be regarded as more volatile or unreliable, especially having in mind
that as society, industry and technology advance, more and more of traces, facts and
evidence will exist in digital form. Therefore, admissibility of electronic evidence as real
evidence should not represent an issue for prosecutor or judiciary, provided that the
procedures described in this Guide are followed.
The authenticity and reliability of electronic evidence must be ensured throughout the
digital forensics process. Forensic staff should have knowledge or/and pay attention to the
existence of an authentic search and seizure order (warrant) by a prosecutor or judge,
records of searched and seized places, items and taken actions, acknowledgement (if
applicable) of a suspect or person in possession of seized items, that records are
authentic, and so forth. Once the electronic evidence has been obtained from the
laboratory, it must be clearly defined in the court as the truth, not the personâ€™s actions, or
the person in possession of seized items, that the defence is in charge of the case, that the
consistent items and actions are followed, without prejudice
