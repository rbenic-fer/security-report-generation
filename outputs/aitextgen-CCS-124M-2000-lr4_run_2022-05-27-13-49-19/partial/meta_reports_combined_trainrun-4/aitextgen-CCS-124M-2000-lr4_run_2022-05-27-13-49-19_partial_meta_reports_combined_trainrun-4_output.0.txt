important evidence by the laboratory is not
have as many evidence in the report. This information can also be stored in two locations:

The use of mobile devices has become a big challenge for the police officers and judges.
These devices are dedicated to the criminal investigation,
well, and in some
taken cases, electronic data is important to take on
the use of data and to provide evidence which can be done
to the public.

It is important that the use of mobile devices is increasing and the use of
the device will grow as more and more and more complex the
investigation to
recnsic and carry out the investigation. As the number and location of devices has increasing, the
devices need to be
also likely to increase,
by the time and effort it
will become less and more necessary to be more aware of the consequences.

In large areas of the forensic laboratory, it is important to remember that this legislation has been
allocated on this device in order to reduce the number and more
data stored in the process. This procedure is
included to a national legislation that would require for a digital forensics Guide. This legislation would be an
undertaken, law-abiding, and order of the
different and most appropriate authority and organisations to assist the
