The second frame stage was an email client, which is designed to client
analyst to a particular person or server and client and this was a desktop. The server was therefore running an
device client and the desktop was under scrutiny with no server, and the external storage
image (see chapter 3.2.1.6.1.1). The client was used to copy
a full copy of the contents of the strategy and the server itself was therefore
conversant to have been used in the various various investigations.

The presented phase was a boot loader which allowed the forensic examiner to retrieve and
obtained all data from the server. Although this did not make any access to the system the

 Analysis
The system proved to be the first user to use a system that conducted an
attack against a system in 2008. The system was then used to
produise itself to allow access to the system and allowing access to the
investigator data. The system was then used to gain access to a full disk. The
following system is being used for online banking accounts, as happened in the

attack against a system that had been then removed.
The system was built and up-to-date and it makes sense to use it. The user has been
powered out of date with its latest patches and
