Prosecutor's considerations
Criminal procedure and substantive law vary through countries and continents. The
usual division between “common law” and “civil law” criminal justice systems still exists,
but the borderline is becoming less visible and hybrid systems emerge as time goes by
and practitioners all over the world are demanding more unified and, above all, more
expedited systems for criminal justice.
The position and role of prosecutors in a contemporary criminal justice system becomes
more prominent. In most systems prosecutors are bridging points between suppression
and litigation, between discovery and adjudication of criminal acts, and between the
police and other law enforcement agencies as well as judges and courts.
Taking that into account, processes and procedures in the forensics laboratory may or
may not be under scrutiny of the public or state prosecutor, but one thing should always
28

Digital Forensics Guide

be on the mind of laboratory staff: facts discovered and evidence produced is always
going to end in the hands of a prosecutors who will be responsible to render lawful
decisions about the fate of the case and it’s perpetrator.
The aim of the investigation should always be two-fold: acquisition of all existing
evidence with regards to the case, and ability to reproduce and explain the forensic
procedure which led to the acquisition.
Prosecutors should be interested in all stages of the process, but they will most
probably focus on the acquisition and presentation stages.
On some occasions, the acquisition stage will be the first encounter of the prosecutor
with the electronic evidence in a criminal case. Often, this contact will happen during
the on call duty and maybe during late hours. With an increasing role of prosecutors
within criminal law systems, they are in charge of decision making throughout the
whole investigation process or a significant part thereof. Thus, a forensic examiner
should expect important and expedited decisions about the acquisition of electronic
evidence to be taken by the responsible prosecutor. In such cases it will be very
important that information presented by examiners to prosecutors about the
acquisition and actions needed includes all relevant facts in an understandable manner
indicating clearly the connection with the crime under investigation.
Examiners should understand a prosecutor’s questions and directions, comment on
them, provide further information and be prepared to extend the acquisition to other
hardware and software if technically and legally possible.
Presentation of extracted evidence and established facts represents the final stage and
goal of the whole process and will be covered in more detail later on in this Guide.

3.2

Acquisition stage

Electronic evidence needs to be acquired in a forensically sound manner. Acquisition of data is
typically conducted by collecting volatile data from a running computer system during a search, or
by acquiring a storage medium from a seized computer or in any other stage during an
investigation. The application of specifically defined and tested procedures at the acquisition step is
crucial as there is an enormous scope for irreversible errors to be made. It is important to keep the
chain of custody intact at any stage, to document all steps carefully and to verify all images and
copies that were acquired.
The intangible nature of any data and information stored in electronic form makes it much easier to
manipulate and more prone to alteration than traditional forms of evidence. This has created
special challenges for the justice system, which requires that such data have to be handled in a
special way to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
Similar to other types of forensic evidence, the correct acquisition and handling of electronic
evidence are vital to the outcome of a case. Close attention must be paid to ensure that the
general guidelines are followed at all times:
Handling by specialists: Every kind of electronic device has its own specific
characteristics that require the correct and appropriate procedures must be applied. One
of the greatest risks is the unintentional modification of the evidence. Failure to adhere to
approved procedures is likely to lead to formal challenges in court about data integrity
that can undermine or invalidate the evidence.
Rapid evolution of electronic evidence sources: New technologies are invented and
develop very quickly. Consequently the procedures and techniques to be applied to them
also need to be constantly reviewed and updated.
Use of proper procedures, techniques and tools: As in more traditional forensic
disciplines, digital forensic specialists require special tools and knowledge to undertake
their investigations properly. It is imperative that the correct techniques and tools are
used for the situations encountered. The procedures must also be auditable and
repeatable by other specialists if the information
====================

In addition to that, different forensic software solutions come with their own propitiatory image software that can be used by
the investigator to extract the data from the mobile device. Although the data that is remotely stored is isolated
in all phases of a forensic examination, the mobile device will still have its own data facilities secured. It is good practise to not only have one backup but also another off-site backup
(see <http://www.slavasoft.com/).
The mobile device will need to be originalised in order to access the data of a mobile device, but it will require a different password (2) for the device. This is due to some handsets having data stored
on the device and if the data is different, the may be stored in a different way or
attention. Other non-urgent techniques do not include physical acquisition of data, because they will require the forensic examiner checking that the
data that the device has been examined.
Mobile devices, unlike computer devices, have further acquisition strategies. If the device is not isolated and allowed to
connect to external networks, such as the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connection, data may be changed on the device. One example is that it is possible to remotely wipe
some mobile devices.
Isolation can be achieved through different forms:


SIM / IDEN Cards – Requires specialist mobile phone forensic tools and equipment.



Memory Cards – Can be examined as a computer hard disk or flash drive.



Device’s Internal Memory – Requires specialist forensic tools and software.

The necessary forensic tools must be provided to the laboratory along with adequate hardware to
support acquisition of these devices and examination of the data.
At this stage, the logical acquisition of the SIM/IDEN card and physical acquisition of the memory
card should be undertaken. A physical examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This should
always be carried out prior to the examination of the device itself. The memory card should only be
returned to the device after it has been examined. This is due to some handsets having data stored
on the memory card and if the memory card is not present, this could cause data loss from the
handset. If time and resources allow, a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created and
that clone inserted into the handset. It is good practice that the SIM/IDEN card found in the device
should remain outside of the exhibit for the duration of the examination so as to isolate the device
from the mobile network. However, the majority of devices which contain SIM/IDEN cards require it
to be present within them when they are powered on or they are susceptible to data loss. To
combat this, a laboratory or cloned SIM/IDEN is created and used within the device so that the
device notes the presence of a SIM/IDEN card, but yet is still not able to communicate with any
mobile networks (for further isolation methods, see chapter 3.2.2.1). It is worth noting, if a device
used an IDEN card, it is often necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN devices are common.
At this stage, if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination, this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should
38

Digital Forensics Guide

attempt the best level of examination possible whilst bypassing the protection. If this is not
possible, the user’s PIN, password or pattern will be required prior to examination. If the PIN,
password or pattern is already known prior to examination, then this should be entered so that full
access can be gained to the device. Again, the best
