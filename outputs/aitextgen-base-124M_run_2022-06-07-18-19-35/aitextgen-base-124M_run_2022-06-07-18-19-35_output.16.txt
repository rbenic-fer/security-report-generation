"The best part about this event is that it allows you to buy a bitcoin at any one time at one of our stores. You can also buy up to two bitcoin at a time from any one bitcoin address."

For those of you that missed the post about what could happen with the event, here's a quick timeline for that:

10/19 – Afternoon of the 21st of the month, the following is a link to the bitcoin-crypto-sale.

11/19 – A limited number of bitcoins are available for sale at that day's bitcoins sale and we'll let you know when it starts. (Note: we've already received enough requests for people to be able to start selling bitcoins. For those who want to stop, we're still adding orders now.)

11/20 – The last sale begins at 11:00am PT. We'll let you know when it's going to begin. (Note: this isn't the last time we'll sell bitcoins. We have lots of transactions currently on the market so it'll likely be the last sale in the future.)

12/19 – BTC.com will be offering special discounts to all those that purchase bitcoin online and will not be responsible for any losses.

12/20 – We'll have special offers for bitcoin on their web site. (The list of special offers will be updated as more information becomes available.)

We're sure that in the coming days, folks will start to buy bitcoins in advance, or we will have another event with additional bitcoin-specific deals for those interested.

We want to thank all of the supporters who have supported Bitcoin in the past and wish you all a fantastic year! Keep up to date with all of the updates, announcements and general announcements at bitcointalk.org or on Twitter, on Facebook or via our website.

New OneCoin Crypto Sale contains a link 'http://www.coinz.com' to the website. This means you can buy OneCoin Crypto at a discounted price.

The key issue for users of the coin is that if they go online now, they will not be able to access the Bitcoin Market. This will require them to invest $200 and then use Bitcoin's premine to create a new cryptocurrency.

The coin is now available as an altcoin.

Do you use OneCoin at work?

Yes! As with all cryptocurrencies, your OneCoin will get you into every part of the network. The coins are sent from all over the world, and the process will take place in real time to ensure that the best possible exchange rate of your OneCoin is as close to as possible to that offered by Bitcoin.

OneCoin has a unique way of "mining" a transaction on an exchange, and is powered by a unique protocol. It was invented by Gavin Andresen and has been implemented on a large scale using existing systems.

There are currently no trading or exchange rate changes to be made to OneCoin.

Bitcoin users should visit the website www.coinz.com and view the full release notes.

Disclaimer: You can buy or sell OneCoin at any of the exchanges listed on the site, but you will only get your coins once you buy and sell them online.
