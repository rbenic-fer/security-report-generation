====================
File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain ids. #2.4.3.2 ids of files downloaded from the Internet (including other computers and files) are not considered to have been exploited. However, any files downloaded from the Internet by anyone other than the user is considered the exploited file. #2.4.4.1 ids are considered to be non-exploitable by the user. If this feature is not enabled or is disabled, files that are downloaded on your machine from a third party website such as the Google Chrome browser will not have an exploitability value. If this feature is enabled, files are considered to be non-exploitable if they are available on your computer (that is, downloaded from your computer). If this feature is disabled, files are considered to be non-exploitable if they are available on your computer (that is, downloaded from the same source), as long as you have installed Adobe Flash. #2.4.5.1

2.4.6.1 ids are considered to be non-exploitable. For Windows XP and earlier versions, files that are downloaded from the Internet are also considered non-exploitable, but files that are downloaded from an FTP site (also known as a "Credential File") that is accessible through a Windows FTP client (like www.microsoft.com) do not. The results of the below commands are for Windows Vista (XP/Vista/2003/2003/2003) and earlier versions of Windows, which use the same FTP program. In all others, these operations are used on the machine and do not take place on the network. In addition, the command-line arguments include the names of the FTP clients used to download the file and the IP address of the client that runs the FTP client. By default, the command-line arguments do not include any text or file names, because the files are being downloaded by users using the FTP protocol. The following commands are available to the user:

A command that performs the following actions when you run the command:

A command that displays a message when the file is downloaded

A command that prompts for an FTP account, in which you specify the FTP account on the file or in which the file is downloaded

A command that displays the current time, if any, for the file and if no current time exists (as shown below). If you do not specify FTP account, all commands listed below are executed immediately after you run the command. The "Download" button is also included when running these operations. To launch the file downloads, type: "Windows" or "FTP" to complete the operation. When the file is downloaded, the command is executed and the user prompts for the FTP account on the file. If no current time exists (as shown below), the FTP client asks the user to enter the password specified in the command.

The FTP client displays a message for a file (and optionally the "User ID" to make the file readable) that shows which files are downloaded on the Internet and what files were downloaded (in ASCII). If you are using a Windows Server 2003 server or a Vista server, you must also use "Download to " or "FTP download to " (and optionally the "User ID" to make the file readable). You can also use the FTP protocol as described above to download files or FTP clients. To download a file using FTP:

Open the file in your text editor. You can run the commands above with any text editor such as Vim or Mac Terminal. You can run these commands by pressing Ctrl+C. Then press Esc to return to the prompt. After you press Ctrl+C, the command-line arguments and options are stored in the files that the FTP client saves as "FTP.txt". You can use your computer's operating system and any file manager like Acrobat Reader or Adobe Acrobat Reader or MacAdobe Adobe Reader or Macintosh ADM32 or later to read or save these files (and optionally the FTP clients). After you run these commands, a new file is created.

For example:

cd "FTP.txt"

Downloads to: FileNameFileName, FTPClientURL, FilePath, FTPConnectionTypeName, FTPFileVersionName, FTPNameFileName, FTPFileVersionTypeName, FTPDate, FTPTime, FTPFileName, FTPFileFilePath, FTPNameFile, FTPFileDate, FTPFileVersionTypeName, FTPDate, FTPFileFileName, FTPFileNameFileVersionTypeName, FTPDate, FTPFileVersionTypeName, FTPDate, FTPFileVersionTypeName, FTPDate, FTPFileDateTypeName, FTPDate, FTPFileVersionTypeName, FTPDate, FTPFileDateName, FTPFileVersionTypeName, FTPFileDateDate,

====================
File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain vernier.exe and it cannot be found on the hard drive (this is due to a bug that has been fixed on many recent versions of Firefox, so it must be downloaded separately).

The problem might be the following:

When a shell is opened using the 'exploit' command:

The prompt looks like this:

This is the version number of exploit used.

The 'exploit' command does not include the 'exploit_office' path of the shell.

The 'exploit' command has a 'c' and 'd' flag. The 'exploit_office' string is empty.

If the 'exploit' command contains a 'exe' in a 'path', then the 'exploit' command does not include an option ('Run-from-File'); in other words, you would get a prompt that tells you the path to use to run it.

If the 'exploit' command is not found, then:

The 'exploit' command is not executable.

The 'exploit' command does not contain any executable information.

If the 'exploit' command is found with:

The 'Exploit_Office' string is empty.

If the 'exploit' command is found with:

The 'exploit' command does not contain any executable information.

The 'exploit' command does not contain any executable information.

If the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Start-Process', then:

The 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Start-Process'. If the 'exploit' command has an option 'Start-Process', then it may have to be run for the exploit to work properly. This is because it is impossible to know where to start an exploit.

If the 'exploit' command has an option 'Stop-Process', then the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Stop-Process'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command does not contain an option 'Wait-For-Exploit', then the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Wait-For-Exploit'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command contains an option 'Install-exploit', then the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Install-exploit'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command has an option 'Start-Process', then:

The 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Start-Process'. If the 'exploit' command has an option 'Start-Process', then the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Start-Process'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command does not contain an option 'Wait-For-Exploit', then the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Wait-For-Exploit'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command has an option 'Start-Process', then the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Start-Process'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command contains an option 'Stop-Process', then the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Stop-Process'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command does not contain an option 'Stop-Process', then:

The 'exploit' command does not contain an option 'Stop-Process'. If the 'exploit' command has an option 'Stop-Process', then:

The 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Stop-Process'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command contains an option 'Stop-Process', then:

The 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Stop-Process'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command does not contain an option 'Start-Process', then:

The 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Start-Process'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command contains an option 'Run-from-File', then the 'exploit' command does not have an option 'Run-from-File'. This causes an 'uninstall' message.

If the 'exploit' command contains an
