Note: You can see the 'Server IP address' field in the status field in the dropdown bar.

Set the firewall rule to 'SOCKET'

If you want to configure the firewall rule to enable network traffic to your server from outside your server, you must set the 'SOCKET' filter.

Set the 'SOCKET rule to 'OPTIONS'. Set the 'OPTIONS filter' to 'SOCKET' to enable 'OPTIONS' to appear in the 'Connection set to the connection and receive packets'.

Configure the firewall rule on the client

Setting the firewall rule to 'SOCKET' will enable the IP addresses for certain client IP addresses from outside your server to your firewall rule for other IP addresses on the same network.

In order to configure the firewall rule to work on the client using a firewall rule, you must set the 'OPTIONS' filter:

[Options] [Default] [OPTIONS] [Parameter name] [Passphrase] [Hostname] [Protocol type] [Port] [Passphrase] [Passphrase] [Port] [IP] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable] [Acceptable]

If you want to connect to the same network from multiple computers, you must set the 'IP address' filter. This means the 'IP address' you want to connect from outside your server is the IP address outside your computer's local IP address.

This can only be done by using the 'Connect to IP' or 'IP Address Range' options in the firewall rule.

When you set the 'IP address' filter to 'SOCKET' it sets the IP address to the address of the IP address outside your computer's local IP address.

To see the 'Internet Protocol version 3' (IPv3) port you can see the 'HTTP Version 3' port.

It doesn't matter which VPN provider the host is using if it's on a different network. It does matter whether or not the host is listening on the same protocol. This is a simple test, if a server is listening to two different protocols, then the server should have to have the second set.

But how can the hosts be able to determine which VPN is listening on which network? There are two ways to do this:

Open an Internet-to-Mail server. If it is one of the two providers, then a server can check if it is listening on the VPN. The other way is to ping the host directly for verification, and send an email requesting confirmation. In this case, the server would receive the email only if it is on the same network and would then have to verify the connection.

Here is a diagram of how to check this:

The above example shows how to set up a single VPN server on the same host.
