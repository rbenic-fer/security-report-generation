It is a known File System Dump (FSD)
Output

This file has a date of 17th August 2004 when the FSD
was copied to the FSD
System. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide a file by scrambling it and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This file can be
store various file types, such as image files or other documents. The output of the file upon the drive
image is in
the form of test files that are stored in a folder designated by the initial investigator.
These test files are created and md5 hashes performed on each as they are written
to the disk. The md5 hash is stored with the output and then the output is
displayed for the investigator. All output listed in this report will be using the text
saved by Autopsy (unless otherwise stated). Screen shots included will be of the
web interface used by the investigator. Additionally, it is recommended that this is not used to disk the
web interface used by the investigator.

This will require the output value of the output file in the output file itself. The output of the file upon the drive
image was:

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries as the lead process control engineer for the project to
design a new fuel cell battery.

fu
ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator to Security Administrator.

eta

ins

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis submitted or analysis was a single Floppy Disk. The disk
received was identified and described as:
