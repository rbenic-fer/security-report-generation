The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this is in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

As will be explained in the next section, the modification of a system is not possible it is not necessary and
the time line number of files observed.

In order to analyse a complete timeline, the modification of the system is not
limited to the PC OS at this point new information.
To prevent errors at the time of seizure of the system clock the following activities are
to the point where the system needs to lay (or overwriting) all
 personal information (like IMEI and application settings)
IP Address of the memory card should be created and so forth.
In order to avoid this, a
different program needs to be created and implemented in such a way as to how they are going to be handled, rather than the
somewhat unusual timings to allow the system to be undertaken without allowing access to the user.
This is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one is found. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important to remember that this is not simply a matter of
salary.

Having identified the number of items required, analysis of the case paperwork supplied with the Internet Watch Foundation
’s analysis, initial research could
occundertaken from the purpose of the law. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the data that the

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system was
written to the laboratory along with the details about the sensitivity of the
Work for Hire Document and the Purported Emails based on its analysis of the media
produced by Mr. Ceglia pursuant to data received as part of expedited discovery. This
report is not intended to detail each and every aspect of Stroz Friedberg’s work in this
engagement.

Evidence Analyzed
Pursuant to the Court Order, Stroz Friedberg collected digital media made available by
Mr. Ceglia. Stroz Friedberg inspected the data on the following media for analysis
according to the terms of the Court-ordered Protocol:
A Compaq Presario SR5413WM desktop computer with a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
An eMachines ET1161-05 desktop computer with a 160 gigabyte hard drive.
A 200 gigabyte Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 external hard drive.
A 500 gigabyte Western Digital internal hard drive.
A 500 gigabyte Western Digital internal hard drive.
174 floppy disks.
https://www.cybersleuthlab.org

1.504.608.5766

info@ cybersleuthlab.org

Using widely-accepted digital forensic techniques and procedures, digital forensic
personnel from Stroz Friedberg made bit-for-bit, verified forensic copies or images of:
the hard drive within the Compaq Presario desktop computer; the hard drive within the
eMachines desktop computer; the Maxtor external hard drive; the Seagate Hard Drive; and 173 of the 174
floppy disks.
The digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of each piece of
media, including the active user-accessible files, the deleted files, and the unallocated
space, which may contain deleted content. Because the forensic image created by
Plaintiff’s Expert is a forensic image file, Stroz Friedberg used a forensically-sound copy
method to copy the forensic image file on that drive to preservation media.

Investigation Steps
Stroz Friedberg conducted its analysis of the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia Media “to
identify only documents, data, fragments, and artifacts that reasonably appear[ed] to
be related to the authenticity of the [Work for Hire] attached to the
Amended Complaint and the [P]urported [E]mails described in the Amended
Complaint.”. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Stroz Friedberg
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz Friedberg
also found in the Amended Complaint in an Amended Complaint in an Amended
Complaint.

3.2.1.2.5

https://www.cybersleuthlab.org

During this analysis, Stroz Friedberg employed a methodology tailored to the particular
facts of this case. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included: (1) conducting keyword and
other searches of the digital forensic copies of the Ceglia Media and other data,
including webmail accounts, to identify responsive documents or fragments of
documents; (2) manually reviewing the documents containing keyword hits, certain
unsearchable file types, such as image files with no text, and other documents to
determine whether they were relevant to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails
