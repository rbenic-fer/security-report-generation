====================
In the opinion of the expert,  Stroz Friedberg found direct and compelling evidence that the
acquisition were authentic. Stroz Friedberg did not find any exact copies of the Work for Hire Document on the
hundreds of pieces of media produced by Mr. Ceglia pursuant to data received as part of expedited discovery. This
report is not intended to detail each and every aspect of Stroz Friedberg’s findings regarding the authenticity of the
Work for Hire Document] attached to this Forensic Note.

Evidence Analyzed
Pursuant to the Court Order, Stroz Friedberg collected digital media made available by
Mr. Ceglia. Stroz Friedberg inspected the data on the following media for analysis
according to the terms of the Court-ordered Protocol:
A Compaq Presario SR5413WM desktop computer with a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
An eMachines ET1161-05 desktop computer with a 160 gigabyte hard drive.
A 200 gigabyte Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 external hard drive.
A 500 gigabyte Western Digital internal hard drive.
A 500 gigabyte Western Digital internal hard drive.
174 floppy disks.

info@cybersleuthlab.org

Using widely-accepted digital forensic techniques and procedures, digital forensic
personnel from Stroz Friedberg made bit-for-bit, verified forensic copies or images of:
the hard drive within the Compaq Presario desktop computer; the hard drive within the
eMachines desktop computer; the Maxtor external hard drive; the Seagate Hard Drive; and 173 of the 174
floppy disks.
The digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of each piece of
media, including the active user-accessible files, the deleted files, and the unallocated
space, which may contain deleted content. Because the forensic image created by
Plaintiff’s Expert is a forensic image file, Stroz Friedberg used a forensically-sound copy
method to copy the forensic image file on that drive to preservation media.

Investigation Steps
Stroz Friedberg conducted its analysis of the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia Media “to
identify only documents, data, fragments, and artifacts that reasonably appear[ed] to
be related to the authenticity of the [Work for Hire] attached to the
Amended Complaint and the [P]urported [E]mails described in the Amended
Complaint.”. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Stroz Friedberg
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg has followed the terms of the Protocol for all data found on the Ceglia
Media and any other data subject to the Protocol during its analysis, including the
procedures for privilege review and production set forth above and the maintenance of
a search log.

During this analysis, Stroz Friedberg employed a methodology tailored to the particular
facts of this case. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included: (1) conducting keyword and
other searches of the digital forensic copies of the Ceglia Media and other data,
including webmail accounts, to identify responsive documents or fragments of
documents; (2) manually reviewing the documents containing keyword hits, certain
unsearchable file types, such as image files with no text, and other documents to
determine whether they were relevant to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails; and (3) reviewing the digital forensic copies of the
Ceglia Media for digital forensic artifacts relevant to the authenticity of the Work for
Hire
Document or the Purported Emails.

Findings
No exact copies of the Work for Hire Document were found on the Ceglia Media,
which comprised hundreds of pieces of media - including computers, hard drives and
floppy disks. Stroz Friedberg used a methodology that would have identified any
copies of the Work for H

Call logs
Call records often carry date/time stamps generated from the handsets internal clock. This can
make recovered time/date stamps for call records unreliable. It is often best practice to obtain
billing information from a mobile service provider to confirm time and date information for call
records. This time stamp is obtained from the mobile service provider’s servers and so can be
considered accurate (or rather it is more likely to be accurate).
3.2.2.3

Application artifacts

Due to the amount of different applications and the multitude of application versions that are
available, it is often necessary to analyse different artifacts unique to different applications. Many
of these applications will, for example, store settings in database files. It may be the case that
deleted database files are recovered and these can be used to ascertain the settings of an
application at a given point in the past. Due to the closed nature of many applications and the lack
of available information, it may often necessary to obtain a test device and conduct some live
research in order to identify the properties of some application artifacts.
3.2.2.2.4

E-mail messages

As with computer-based examinations, e-mail communications on mobile devices can be used within
default Mail applications and through web mail accessed through the internet browser. On some
devices, such as newer Apple iPhones, the extraction of email messages from the default Mail
application is not supported. In these cases the examiner will have to manually record the data or
attempt to gather this data from other sources.
3.2.2.5

Web history entries

Internet browsers on mobile devices can be split into three distinct groups groups groups: communication data,
media files and other data. Communication data can include call records, SMS messages and other
messaging service messages. Media files, as with computers, can contain information beyond what
is depicted by the file. Meta data on media files captured by the

If so, be sure to give a patch for the access to the laboratory to allow for a to advance in the
business plan of the digital forensics laboratory.

Once this initial research has been conducted, the digital forensics analyst
should have a better idea about the physical integrity of the digital forensic laboratory as well as the procedures and processes to be
followed.

Location
Several factors will come into place when considering the location of any digital forensic laboratory.
Ideally, a property in a central location would be a preferred choice. After identifying the business
area that the laboratory will be service and the location from which the exhibits will be seized a
more informed choice of location will be identified in the business case.

====================
In the opinion of the expert,  Stroz Friedberg found on the Ceglia
Media seven unsigned versions of the Work for Hire Document that are very similar but
not identical to the purported Work for Hire Document. All seven of those electronic
documents contain metadata anomalies indicative of backdating and document
manipulation.
Mr. Ceglia’s Amended Complaint purports to quote from or otherwise reference 22
Purported Emails between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg. During the litigation, Mr.
Ceglia acknowledged that he did not keep the Purported Emails referenced in the
Amended Complaint in their original native form, that is to say, as individual files in
message format. Rather, he claimed to have copied-and-pasted the text of the
Purported Emails into Microsoft Word documents saved to floppy disks in order to
maintain copies of these messages.

Stroz Friedberg found substantial evidence that all three of the Word documents
containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date and time at which computer activity, such as the creation or modification
of documents, occurred. Backdating can be accomplished by setting the system clock
on a computer hard drive to an earlier date, such that activity that occurs on the hard
drive while Thundermed from the numerous items of computer
record, that in two of the above stages are necessary.
Mr. Ceglia’s findings regarding the authenticity of the
Work for Hire Document and the Purported Emails based on its analysis of the media
produced by Mr. Ceglia pursuant to data received as part of expedited discovery. This
report is not intended to detail each and every aspect of Stroz Friedberg’s work in this
engagement.

Evidence Analyzed
Pursuant to the Court Order, Stroz Friedberg collected digital media made available by
Mr. Ceglia. Stroz Friedberg inspected the data on the following media for analysis
according to the terms of the Court-ordered Protocol:
A Compaq Presario SR5413WM desktop computer with a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
An eMachines ET1161-05 desktop computer with a 160 gigabyte hard drive.
A Toshiba Satellite L305-55968 laptop computer with a 320 gigabyte hard drive.
A 200 gigabyte Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 external hard drive.
