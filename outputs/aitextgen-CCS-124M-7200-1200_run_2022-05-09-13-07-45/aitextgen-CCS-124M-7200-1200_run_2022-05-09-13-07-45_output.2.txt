“NTFS Documentation – The space allocated to central server will need to be secure due to the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room for resilience like UPS.
2.5.2

Software and hardware

Hardware - The digital forensic laboratory should be a high tech environment with lots of sensitive
data being analysed and stored. As such, it will require an examination network, which is isolated
from any external connections. As all external connections – the laboratory will need to be a
secure room with access control. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room for resilience like UPS.

2.5.3

Software and hardware

In addition to the above, it deals with the management issues on the digital forensic laboratory should be a laboratory in type to address.
In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage of non-evidential equipment like media
copiers, media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
The building or office selected should be large enough to expand if there is an anticipated increase
in demand for digital forensic investigation.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility.
Many existing digital forensics facilities have found it necessary to relocate or expand in a short
space of time due to exponential increases in workload. The information gathered during the
research phase will give a good idea of the likely need for future expansion. It is extremely
expensive to relocate or expand, so it may be beneficial to provide room for expansion in the initial
business plan.

3.5.4
Air conditioning
Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled. Ideally an area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss or lost in a
special area. Ideally an area to avoid or lost in the
damage of the laboratory should notify specialists be prepared to carry heavy items too far. Ideally you should install strong shelving and a
numbering system to segregate the exhibits to allow for each entry.
Consider purchasing plastic boxed to house the smaller exhibits. The exact location of the exhibits
for each room must be large enough to expand enough to expand enough to expand, secure and fast. When setting suitable premises will be beneficial due to the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility. The exact location of the exhibits
for each room must be a high tech environment with lots of sensitive
data being analysed and stored. As such, it will require an examination network, which is isolated
from any external connections. As all laboratory staff will use this network it will need to be
resilient, secure and fast. When setting up any server or system, best practice would be to opt for
the highest available processing power and a suitable data storage array.
This is a risk, as many devices will generate a lot of data they can extract only because of the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be in
writing. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.
Off-site back up of electronic evidence held on servers should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
Considerations about the physical location should include; when in doubt, be identified in person to be able topage or record the
electronic data. In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage
devices should be considered inHandling.
Electronic evidence...
... is invisible to inside a digital forensics laboratory.
... is invisible to the untrained eye: Electronic evidence is often found in places where
only specialists would search or in locations reachable only by means of special tools.
... is highly volatile: On some devices and under certain conditions computer memory
(and the evidence it contains) can be overwritten (or altered) by the usual functioning of the device. This might be caused, of course, by a loss of power or where
the system needs to lay (or ‘write’) new information over

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, a floppy disk was recovered from an
program
(Camouflage) found in the Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project to
design a new fuel cell battery. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis was a single Floppy Disk. The disk

support acquisition of these electronic documents and examination of the data. In addition to the explanatory
floppy disks, the digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of the

These test can be performed in order to establish the
material or substantive truth, depending on the platform and on the platform itself. The imaging of the

Digital Forensics Guide

1.
Introduction
This Guide has been produced as a follow on to the Council of Europe Electronic Evidence Guide1,
which was developed as a basic guide for police officers, prosecutors and judges. The Electronic
Evidence Guide provides guidance on the steps to be taken to secure electronic evidence, for
example at a crime scene and to ensure its evidential integrity is maintained until it is passed to
digital forensics laboratory for further action. The present Guide takes the reader to the next
stages of activity in the digital forensics arena. In addition to the practical processes and
procedures to be followed in a laboratory environment, it deals with the management issues
involved in the running of a laboratory and also the strategic considerations in establishing such a
laboratory.
This Guide should also be at the disposal of prosecutors and judges. Although members of the
judiciary are not obliged to be well acquainted or specialised in skills other than legal,
contemporary criminal acts and their perpetrators are putting additional pressure on professionals
both in prosecution services and courts to better understand and enhance their knowledge of
cybercrime and raise their capabilities to render decisions in criminal cases on cybercrime or
electronic evidence.

1.

The purpose of the Guide

1.

What is included

The purpose of the Guide is to provide support and guidance to managers and practitioners of
digital forensics laboratories in the setting up and running of such a way in
offer support. The guidance is to provide support and guidance to managers and practitioners of
digital forensics laboratories in the setting up and running of such a Manager. Best practice shows that in many digital forensics
disciplines that the Guide is not intended to be an instruction manual with
step-by-step directions, it is not intended to detail each and every aspect of Stroz Friedberg’s work in this
engagement.
The purpose of the Guide is to provide support and guidance to everybody who contemplates setting up and relying
to the Guide to provide them with a better overview of the kinds of issues that often arise when
developing and running a digital forensics laboratory and offers advice on how to deal with elsewhere in this Guide.
Readers of this document should check if such advice already exists at the national level.
These resources can assist in the efficient understanding and remembering of the requirements of the digital forensic laboratory that is to be created.
These resources can assist in the efficient understanding and remembering of the
their findings regarding the procedure that is to be created that is to provide them with a better understanding of the
role and substantive quality of streamlined procedures that are followed in the Electronic Evidence Guide.

best practice to ensure admissibility at trial.
