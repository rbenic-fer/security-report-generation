by Ballard Industries as the lead process control engineer for the project to

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator to Security Administrator.

Many of the Spyware programs conducted a social engineering attack
and the user seems to have been duped into installing them. The user was relatively new to computing and did not really understand much of
what was going on. For example:

By the 8th August 2004 they appear to have become annoyed with the popups their
Spyware was generating and they installed popup stopper. But given the number of
items of Spyware and the fact that many had been legitimately installed (having
duped the user), this had little chance of stopping the problem, furthermore, they
were only treating the symptoms and not the cause.

Considerations about a type of wireless jamming or a digital forensics policy

in demand for digital forensics investigation.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility.
Many existing digital forensics facilities have found it necessary to relocate or expand in a short
space of time due to exponential increases in workload. The information gathered during the initial
forensic examination should give a good idea of the likely need for future expansion. It is extremely
expensive to relocate or expand, so it may be beneficial to provide room for expansion in the initial
business plan.

Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be
purchased in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control the efficient its staff and to control the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.
Considerations about the physical location should also be in place to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.
Considerations about the physical location should include;


Are there any damages to the physical location of any digital forensics laboratory and its physical location should be considered in

There are several other H&S features that enable searching for on the likes of grep or
any text string search

In other words the basis of the searching for file or disk records is typically a
purchase operation that can search for specific keywords (e.g. search for child abuse material or stolen
blueprints, etc). However, the hash comparison can be done by reviewing the raw data that fall within

imaging queues.
