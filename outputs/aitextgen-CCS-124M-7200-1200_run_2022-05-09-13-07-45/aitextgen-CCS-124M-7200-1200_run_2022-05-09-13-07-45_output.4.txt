operation of the device. This might be caused, for instance, by a loss of power or where
the system needs to lay (or ‘write’) new information over the top of the old due to lack of user knowledge resulted in a

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from the Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

purchased and allowed to external connections.
3.2.1.2.3

User activity and behaviour

Once the initial file signature has been created, it is best practice to try and segregate the type of
manual handling.
This is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the initial file signature is
generated. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise the effect on the electronic evidence and to attempt to preserve
the integrity of the data to the highest standard possible. It is vital to consider that for some
mobile devices it may be necessary to modify system files or the operating system, or in some
cases upload and install a dedicated application in order to successfully extract data from the
devices. This process can cause some data to be irrecoverably lost; this is normally only system
files with little to no evidential value. The knowledge of what is altered by any of these processes
can be demonstrated by holding appropriate training certifications, such as training provided by the
manufacturers of mobile forensics software, or practical experience involving the testing of what
data, if any, on the device is altered by making these system changes.
3.2.2.5 Hardware and software
Analysis of mobile devices typically requires the use of dedicated software and the correct cable.
Some additional, dedicated tools will include stand-alone extraction tools. More advanced
examination techniques, such as JTAG or Chip-Off will require further tools, including soldering
equipment and specialist jigs to read raw data from the device’s memory chips.
3.2.2.2.6 Levels of examination
There are five different levels of examination for mobile devices, with the best possible extraction
being listed first:


Physical




Physical


The best method will depend on local laws, laboratory set less security policy framework, access policy
and maybe even legal advice.
At this stage, the logical conclusions will be made requiring the use of dedicated software and the correct cable.
Irrespective of the physical examination tool must be aware of the procedures that the police follow, in order to assure themselves that
the correct handing over of the law allow for a data acquisition exists.
Therefore, this procedure should also be taken into account when in doubt is the same.

Managers in the laboratory may or may not be aware of the procedures that the police follow, in order to assure themselves that
the correct handing over of the law can be broken down under the same name,

A logical explanation of the actions the police follow, or put privacy screens between the
role and potentially destructive subject, are often stipulated by laws or acts on
electronic
devices.

====================
It is recommended that  The Forensic
is correspondingly high even if a suspect has tried to cover his or any
Company subject, but his or any
Company member of the team is likely to engage with any illegal activity or
not covered by the Court. Where possible the structure of a digital forensics capability
should incrementally allow, a digital forensics capability is the arena.
If it is above the ground floor, a digital forensics capability should be provided. Often this can be transfer to a forensic computer in order to analyse an e-mails. If this
is not supported by the good oral of the operation type of type required. The following is a
secure room with access control. It should be situated close to reception and close to the Imaging
area to avoid cross-contamination.
The digital forensic laboratory should have a server – this may be stored securely within the
laboratory and if available, a separate network.
An area designated by the Civil Procedure Act should allow the digital forensic analysts to access games or the Internet. This should be a room with access to the
mobile network. The light on the mind of laboratory staff that should be concluded in a digital forensics case. The digital forensic laboratory should in this area.
If digital forensic investigation has been required,
the digital forensic laboratory should be a high tech environment with lots of sensitive
data being analysed and stored. As such, it should be an aim. There are several types of ‘ deleted’ traces automatically stored on the desktop and a hard drive.
In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage of non-evidential equipment like media
copiers, media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, tags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
The building or office selected should be large enough to expand if there is an anticipated increase
in demand for digital forensic investigation.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility.
Many existing digital forensics facilities have found it necessary to relocate or expand in a short
space of time due to exponential increases in workload. The information gathered during the
research phase will give a good idea of the likely need for future expansion. It is extremely
expensive to relocate or expand, so it may be beneficial to provide room for expansion in the initial
business plan.

Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be
purchased in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control staff. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.
Considerations for an additional room for briefings or meetings as several of the
Spyware and Trojans installed are capable of keystroke logging.
In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage of non-evidential equipment like media
copiers, media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, tags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
The building or office selected should have control over the original set up, identifying the building, purchasing
equipment and guidance to police officers, which will contain information to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
