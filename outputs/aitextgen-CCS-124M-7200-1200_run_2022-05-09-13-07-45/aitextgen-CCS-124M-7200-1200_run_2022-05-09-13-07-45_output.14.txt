Note of eviction contains attachment  It is widely accepted that this is not possible to avoid a broken or ineffective power button (see chapter 3.2.2.2.2 for levels of examination).
3.2.2.2 Wiping imaging media / sterilising / cross-contamination
When producing images of the mobile devices, it is considered best practice to use a clean target
medium, which does not contain any data relating to any previously examined exhibits. If using
laboratory or cloned SIM cards, examiners must ensure that the laboratory SIM card contains the
data from the last inserted SIM card.
3.2.3 Write blocking
Due to some specific extraction techniques, such as iOS Boot loader extractions and rooting of
Android devices, it is not always possible to implement write-blockers or other
protfacts. Where possible writeblockers should have a separate ‘viewing card’ room to allow for visiting officers/prosecutors to view
their cases without causing distraction to the user data.
3.2.2.5 Hardware and software
Analysis of mobile devices typically requires the use of dedicated software and the correct cable.
Some additional, dedicated tools will include stand-alone extraction tools. More advanced
examination techniques, such as JTAG or Chip-Off will require further tools, including soldering
equipment and specialist jigs to read raw data from the device’s memory chips.

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries as the lead process control engineer for the project to
design a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

fu
ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the analysis.  Listard that the
documents were
inconsistent with Mr Keen’s findings regarding the authenticity of the
Work for Hire Document and the Purported Emails based on its analysis of the media
produced by Mr Keen pursuant to data received as part of expedited discovery. This
report is not intended to detail each and every aspect of Stroz Friedberg’s findings regarding the authenticity of the
Work for Hire Document or the Purported Emails based on its analysis of the media.

Evidence Analyzed
Pursuant to the Court Order, Stroz Friedberg collected digital media made available by
Mr. Ceglia. Stroz Friedberg inspected the data on the following media for analysis
according to the terms of the Court-ordered Protocol:
A Compaq Presario SR5413WM desktop computer with a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
An eMachines ET1161-05 desktop computer with a 160 gigabyte hard drive.
A 200 gigabyte Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 external hard drive.
A 500 gigabyte Western Digital internal hard drive.
174 floppy disks.

1.504.608.5766

info@cybersleuthlab.org

Using widely-accepted digital forensic techniques and procedures, digital forensic
personnel from Stroz Friedberg made bit-for-bit, verified forensic copies or images of:
the hard drive within the Compaq Presario desktop computer; the hard drive within the
eMachines desktop computer; the Maxtor external hard drive; the Seagate Hard Drive; and 173 of the 174
floppy disks.
The digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of each piece of
media, including the active user-accessible files, the deleted files, and the unallocated
space, which may contain deleted content. Because the forensic image created by
Plaintiff’s Expert is a forensic image file, Stroz Friedberg used a forensically-sound copy
method to copy the forensic image file on that drive to preservation media.

Investigation Steps
Stroz Friedberg conducted its analysis of the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia Media “to
identify only documents, data, fragments, and artifacts that reasonably appear[ed] to
be related to the authenticity of the [Work for Hire] attached to the
Amended Complaint and the [P]urported [E]mails described in the Amended
Complaint.”. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Stroz Friedberg
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg has followed the terms of the Protocol for all data found on the Ceglia
Media and any other data subject to the Protocol during its analysis, including the
procedures for privilege review and production set forth above and the maintenance of
a search log.

Some laboratories have a separate ‘viewing’ room to allow for visiting officers/prosecutors to view
their cases without causing distraction to the forensic analysts.
Ideally the office will have its own rest room facilities or there will be one situated in close
proximity.
In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage of non-evidential equipment like media
copiers, media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
The building or office selected should be large enough to expand if there is an anticipated increase
in demand for digital forensic investigation.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility.
Many existing digital forensics facilities have found it necessary to relocate or expand in a short
space of time due to exponential increases in workload. The information gathered during the
research phase will give a good idea of the likely need for future expansion. It is extremely
expensive to relocate or expand, so it may be beneficial to provide room for expansion in the initial
business plan.

Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should provide room for expansion in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.
Considerations about the physical integrity of the laboratory should it be necessary. Such a facility or its logical structure should include an additional security policy in place. More details on

Physical laboratory requirements

Once this location has been identified and the initial recruitment processes for
a digital forensics team are underway, it is important to consider the establishment of the physical condition of the staff that is to be employed to carry out the
different roles within the laboratory. The establishment of an achievable staff development program can support this. This must
commence with an induction to their new workplace. Initial documents should clearly illustrate their
role and responsibilities, their reporting manager and their senior manager. These initial documents
must identify any immediate training needs or desires to identify their new workplace or any
role and record arrangements that are agreed to
address this plan. Such arrangements may send staff on training courses or arranging for them to
address this plan. Such arrangements may send staff on training courses or arranging for them to
address this plan. For example, all Digital Forensic
Analysts will require externally certificated training to provide them with the

forensic analysts with the information to provide them with the better understanding of their career path and retain

them at the time of seizing digital devices. Alternately these staff
members will require specific forensic knowledge or experience in the initial
business plan.
Once this initial research has been conducted, it is vital that digital forensics analysts are fully trained and able to search for
the most appropriate place to locate digital forensic artifacts. Prosecutors and judges
should also be aware of the procedures that the police follow, in order to assure themselves that
the correct procedures have been adopted in individual cases they may be prosecuting or
adjudicating.
