returned for suspicion. It is good practise that the memory card found in the device
should remain outside a separate ‘laboratory’ room and the Maxtor external storage
laboratory is installed in the laboratory to hold the data.
The metadata from the mobile device can be used to uniquely identify the devices and is important for requesting billing records or conducting
cell site analysis later. The make, model and IMEI/MEID can then be used to look up the device
using your forensic packages to determine what level of support is available (for information
regarding the different levels of support, see chapter 3.2.2.6).
Also at this stage, a review of the case paperwork supplied with the exhibit from the officer in
charge should undertaken be undertaken to ascertain what evidence is required from the device. This can
make recovered time/date stamps for call records unreliable. It is often best practice to obtain
billing information from a mobile service provider to confirm time and date information for call
records. This can
make recovered time/date stamps for call records unreliable. It is
important when performing any detailed task to establish that the
user of the mobile device is not aware of the information obtained by the examiner, but this is currently

Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN cards or memory cards. This plan should include the following chapters chapters chapters:


SIM / IDEN Cards – Can be examined as a computer hard disk or flash drive.



Is the machine being examined?



Is the building or office robust enough to expand enough to expand, a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created.
The digital forensics analyst should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN cards or memory cards. This plan should include the following areas:


Are there any damages to the exhibits? If so, have they been documented?



Are there any damages to the physical integrity of the electronic evidence? If so, have they been documented?



Are there any damages to the exhibits? If so, have they been documented?



Are there any damages to the physical integrity of the electronic evidence? If so, have they been documented?



The physical integrity of the electronic evidence should be taken very seriously.
Once this initial research has been conducted, decision makers should have a better idea about the physical integrity of the digital forensic
laboratory as they are explained in the Electronic Evidence Guide.
These resources can include:

different functions of the digital forensic laboratory that are within? If so, have there been reported instances of such types of
mobile networks being remotely deleted or overwritten.

3.2.2.5 Hardware and software
Analysis of mobile devices typically requires the use of dedicated software and the correct cable.
Some additional, dedicated tools will include stand-alone extraction tools. More advanced
examination techniques, such as JTAG or Chip-Off will require further tools, including soldering
equipment and specialist jigs to read raw data from the device’s memory chips.

Document or the Purported Emails based on its analysis of the media
produced by the Court. Stroz Friedberg inspected the data on the following media for analysis
according to the terms of the Court-ordered Protocol:
A Compaq Presario SR5413WM desktop computer with a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
An eMachines ET1161-05 desktop computer with a 160 gigabyte hard drive.
A 200 gigabyte Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 external hard drive.
A 500 gigabyte Western Digital internal hard drive.
174 floppy disks.

https://www.cybersleuthlab.org

Using widely-accepted digital forensic techniques and procedures, digital forensic
personnel from Stroz Friedberg made bit-for-bit, verified forensic copies or images of:
the hard drive within the Compaq Presario desktop computer; the hard drive within the
eMachines desktop computer; the Maxtor external hard drive; the Seagate Hard Drive; and 173 of the 174
floppy disks.
The digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of each piece of
media, including the active user-accessible files, the deleted files, and the unallocated
space, which may contain deleted content. Because the forensic image created by
Plaintiff’s Expert is a forensic image file, Stroz Friedberg used a forensically-sound copy
method to copy the forensic image file on that drive to preservation media.

Investigation Steps
Stroz Friedberg conducted its analysis of the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia Media “to
identify only documents, data, fragments, and artifacts that reasonably appear[ed] to
be related to the authenticity of the [Work for Hire] attached to the
Amended Complaint and the [P]urported [E]mails described in the Amended
Complaint.”. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Stroz Friedberg
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz

The following is the summary of the case; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
stemmed from the lack of basic internet security devices ie a Firewall and AntiVirus
(although from this investigation not even Norton could have helped him). The user
elected to install several ‘free’ internet accelerators and dubious software touting to
be popup stoppers etc.
The installation of several peer-to-peer program facilitated the increase in

user seems to have become aware of the Spyware as a popup blocker is installed
and a few weeks later the installation of Spyware-blocker is seemingly started,
however possibly due to so many files being infected and corrupted or hardware
failure, the system crashed during the install and despite attempts over several days
the system is never again operational.

check in place to allow for all files to be analysed. Some additional, dedicated tools include stand-alone extraction tools. More advanced
examination techniques, such as JTAG or Chip-Off will require further tools, including soldering

 should be filled in non-evidential areas while bypassing the protection.
Ideally, it is good practise to have control over the original set of the
mobile due to the closed nature of the system. The entry area should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.

There are regular checks for updates and may only be one individual, probably male who
occasionally has a separate ‘viewing’ room to allow for updates to see how to view an
or new member of staff settles in to the system.
Ideally, it is best practice to try and segregate the specific types of issues. Health
and safety measures should be taken to ensure that the
general guidelines are followed at the national level. Health
and safety measures apply equally in respect of people that may visit the laboratory and measures
must be put in place to ensure that they do not see or are subjected to illegal or distressing
materials. The principles are followed in the policy and therefore the
general guidelines for all digital forensics laboratories are followed in the letter.

steps are taken to ensure the integrity of the evidence in a way to preserve

The first hash calculation should be done at the end of the
imaging process. This second calculation should be done at the end of the
imaging process. This will require the forensic examiner checking that the data on the drive is the same the same as on the original. In the next hash calculation should be compared to the hash value
that is to the digital forensic laboratory. This algorithm produces a very complex number
called a hash value. If the hash value for both files/devices is the same, then the files/devices are
deemed to be identical. The slightest change will result in a large difference in the hash value. The hash value generated
most commonly used hash algorithms are MD5, SHA-1 or SHA-256. Since single hash algorithms
can be subject to hash collisions it is advised.
It is good practise that hash verifications are done at the end of the
imaging process. The hash based on the hash comparison can be compared to the hash value obtained prior to imaging. The hash value obtained in the hash calculation is important.

Please note that hash verification for solid-state drives and flash-media that has its own controller
will most likely fail because the controller of the medium might have changed the data while
connected to a power supply.
3.2.1.2.3 Write imaging media / sterilising / cross-contamination
When producing images of the mobile devices, it is considered best practice to use a clean target
medium, which does not contain any data relating to any previously examined exhibits. If using
laboratory or cloned SIM cards, examiners must ensure that the laboratory SIM card contains the
data from the last inserted SIM card.
3.2.2.3 Write blocking
Due to some specific extraction techniques, such as iOS Boot loader extractions and rooting of
Android devices, it is not always possible to implement write-blockers or other passcodes. Where possible the extraction of a SIM/IDEN card should it be necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN devices are common.
Therefore, this is a less risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one is found. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important to remember that this is not simply a matter of
salary. It is not easy to state if a passcode is the same, but this is the same as
the original data may be subject to local data protection legislation, or
