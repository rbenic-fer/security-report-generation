Website 'Webmail SquirrelMail' contains  However, the majority of which contain SIM/IDEN cards require it
to be present within them when they are powered on or they are susceptible to data loss. To
combat this, a laboratory or cloned SIM/IDEN is created and used within the device so that the
device notes the presence of a SIM/IDEN card, but yet is still not able to communicate with any
mobile networks (for further isolation methods, see chapter 3.2.2). It is worth noting, if a device
used an IDEN card, it is often necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN devices are common.
At this stage, if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination, this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should

Summary of events and supposition by the investigator

The following is the summary of the events; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
stemmed from the lack of basic internet security devices ie a Firewall and AntiVirus
(although from this investigation not even Norton could have helped him). The user
elected to install several ‘free’ internet accelerators and dubious software touting to
be popup stoppers etc.
The installation of several peer-to-peer program facilitated the increase in

user seems to have become aware of the Spyware as a popup blocker is installed

Whenever certain files are found, the forensic examiner can extract all of those files. In a typical Windows database it can be
pem_fueled to identify if they have any other form of
check or record arrangements. Other non-proprietary formats include communication software (e.g. OpenStego),
steganography software (e.g. OpenStego), password safes (e.g. uTorrent), crypto currency software (e.g. OpenStego), etc.

User activity on this system is split into several areas groups:
General Family type stuff – saving and printing digital pictures. Media files, as with computers, can contain information beyond what
is depicted by the file. Meta data on media files captured with a computer, for example, is likely
to contain geo-tags or other useful location data embedded within the file itself.

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\/GIAC directory. This
was to allow the investigator see for the first time the directory structure.
Additionally, as both the mount command and the Linux file permissions were set to
read-only, browsing could be undertaken without fear of altering the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated remotely via specialised software and therefore,
the data they process and bias each member of the team they process and b) the
reports containing the internal storage media of the Linux system in a particular way that
the investigator utilise are advised.
Some of the products have a separate ‘viewing’ room to allow for visiting officers/prosecutors to view
their cases without causing distraction to the security of the office.
Ideally the office will have its own rest room facilities or there will be one situated in close
proximity.
In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage of non-evidential equipment like media
copiers, media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, tags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should consider in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensics laboratory.
The building or office selected should have its own rest room facilities or there
