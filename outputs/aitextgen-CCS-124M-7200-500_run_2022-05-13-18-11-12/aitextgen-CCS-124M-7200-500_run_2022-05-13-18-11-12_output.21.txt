available for forensic analysis. The initial and ongoing stream of forensic tools being used should be given for

laboratory. The work station was not able to be able to be easily due to difficulties
tamining forensic findings, but could potentially damage to data. The work station was not in close conjunction with any one of the
UK IT Security lawyers during the investigation phase. The work station had probably worked there for some time as
well as several of the forensic work related to the various methods of forensically acquiring digital data. The roles and functions that were needed for the identification and selection of these areas should be
undertaken before purchase to ensure the integrity of the original evidence.
