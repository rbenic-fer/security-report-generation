Log entry found: Firewall (Type: Firewall)  will quickly pop up in the background as a result of its auto-update.

Firefox will run auto-update again as well. This is exactly the first time it does this. On the first occasion SophosLabs identified a vulnerability that allowed it to be automatically updated on your computer. If your computer is still not compromised, Firefox will not automatically update it from a known vulnerability. If you are the administrator of Firefox, this method would allow you to update from a known exploit on a computer, making the situation more difficult for anti-virus engines.

Firefox also stores updates and updates. On Firefox, users need to manually update to patch their computers. On my machine it would have prevented this happening. It has been confirmed to work as quickly as it can, and has now been fixed, in order to avoid this happening again.

Firefox will also check that any unpatched version of the software you download is updated when you upgrade to the latest version of the OS X operating system. This is quite the method of updating a browser. If you haven’t already downloaded anything, go and ensure that it is updated to the latest version of the OS X operating system (as well as any upgrade to your computer).

Firefox will be able to update a certain version of the OS X operating system. These are the best known vulnerabilities used by many Apple and Microsoft users.

It’s only really possible that a virus will run within your environment that the current version of your computer is not affected by malware and you have not chosen to run auto-update from a known security vulnerability. But it would be interesting if Apple had not updated their security settings. It’s possible that Apple could use the best settings and the best practices for patching against this attack.

Firefox will be able to automatically update, update and update your computer automatically as soon as you upgrade to the latest version of OS X. Unfortunately, as a percentage, you will have to upgrade to Snow Leopard to upgrade to a fully patched version of OS X. On Apple’s own Mac-based anti-virus protection, it would be quite the opposite.

With Snow Leopard, it’s possible that they are using the trick of running automatic updates. After applying automatic updates, Apple will automatically update and update your PC with your OS X operating system, making it more difficult for anti-virus engines.

But if you are running an older version of OS X it would be possible that Apple have had not updated your Windows computer to ensure that updates are not automatically accessed. But that doesn’t seem to be 100% true. And it certainly seems to be more annoying when it comes to Apple users.

With enough software available to run automatically and update your PC with an updated version of OS X (update.6) you need to take a closer look at the software’s settings and roll back an update to the latest version. It will be possible that this will not be the last time you receive updates from a trusted company.

It’s certainly possible that Apple has chosen to upgrade to Snow Leopard to update its Mac version of OS X.   It’s even possible that the update will have been available for download and other users.  In other words, it would be a good idea to upgrade to Snow Leopard as part of their anti-virus product.

With so many new installations for Apple, it’s obvious that hackers have managed to exploit more of this Windows problem.  On a positive note, the patches released by Apple appear to be available for all 32-bit versions of the operating system.  It’s certainly very disappointing to see a number of people in the security community fall for such an attack – especially if it does take the security of your PC seriously.


W32/Dloadr-A was the first ever release of a “handling worm”.

In November 2008 W32/Dloadr-A released a worm (also known as Downadup-A).  However, this time it was back for a few hours, following the release of Windows XP and Internet Explorer.

The worm has received a lot of press reports, so the story is that in March 2008 it was spreading by automatically infecting removable disks (BK) using the W32/Dloadr-A file in a number of randomly-chosen processes.  The Autorun file was dropped onto the infected PC by the infected system by the virus’s self-inf shellcode (i.e. from the C: drive), and infected with W32/Dloadr-A.

It seems this W32/Dloadr-A is the last example of a string to be dropped to the infected PC as a “solution” – the name of the system file, and the language used for writing the malware.

By the way, W32/Dloadr-A was the last one of the four Trojans on the first W32/Dloadr malware attack.


We have been receiving quite some spam messages from Facebook users saying they have received a ‘from’ address.  I saw this on Facebook’s ‘from page’ and so it has taken a closer look at my account.

A colleague from Facebook explained why Facebook has not been able to deliver an official email to all of my Facebook friends – but the email was received this time via Facebook:

It looks like Facebook has chosen to take a ‘from’ address, which is what Facebook calls it.  It seems that Facebook has chosen not to email them via email to email addresses.

But this kind of social engineering trick is just as successful – indeed, it could lead to Facebook spamming, or even malicious code spreading quickly on a compromised computer.  Clearly Facebook’s email address was not the main reason for this campaign.

But there are several Facebook users who would find a login in this case.  For instance, they would click on the link to take an online survey, they are asked to print their personal information out of the curious:

I have received the email.
[from] Please send this letter to your friends via this link, the first time this email is from your Facebook account or phone number.

That was a scam.  No email messages, no text message, and nothing else.  We do not confirm any action by Facebook to email you via the link.

It is possible that Facebook might have decided that this has been not a genuine email, or that they had failed to deliver an email to their friends via the link.

It may, therefore, be possible that Facebook won’t ever do its best to contact Facebook to deliver the email.  But it’s pretty much possible that Facebook will have taken steps to stamp out these messages and block spam messages from spreading as far as possible.

It’s unlikely that Facebook will be able to stamp out spam messages from your Facebook friends as a safety precaution, but that is far from the case.

Update: This isn’t the first time Facebook has chosen to block spam messages from spreading via Facebook – a bit like this.  For instance, earlier this year it was Facebook’s fault, sending a message from a message about a ‘from’ address to spread rapidly via email.


The new version of Internet Explorer has a security flaw in Internet Explorer, meaning that all Internet Explorer users could potentially be at risk from this exploit.

There are several methods that are exploited in order to compromise Internet Explorer.

One is the use of WebDAV, by the way, known as ‘web remote web server’.

Another method, known by the BIE-A (also known as the Autorun.inf, is to use webpages hosted on a malicious domain’s server.

BIE-A, by default, is not a very popular web server, so it is possible that the people behind BIE-A are using some rather different method (e.g. a web page), but it does provide a whole host of security-related webpages – web page with web content hosted on a malicious domain’s server.

This method uses the concept that web servers are more secure against Internet-based attacks by using up-to-date browser exploits. This is a problem that is easy to deal with if you want web-based exploits to be used by an attacker who has the same knowledge of your online PC or Mac.

I am not saying about how BIE-A works in this case but I’m sure it will be interesting to see how fast it becomes.

There isn’t much truth on the Internet Explorer web server that has been so slow by the Internet Explorer community, but there are many.


SophosLabs has issued an advisory to users who have been affected by some of the following SQL injection attacks:

It may be the case that a malicious script was executed in the last few hours or so by the end of the morning and on Saturday the same day the attackers were having a bad weekend.

What may have been a little more sinister was that the website had been compromised, and that it was possible that some of the site’s more important users were affected by SQL injection attacks:

As I have mentioned previously, the SQL injection attacks
====================
Log entry found: Firewall (Type: Firewall) 
This may be an attempt to steal your PC (for example, a file attached to a computer, a video of a computer crash or a message on a website), or an attempt to steal your personal information or install malware onto your computer (for example, a link to an update from another version of your computer). 
The intention is to steal your PC or data, or install software or a flash player, or to steal your personal information or plant malware onto your computer (for example, a video of a car crash).  If the Trojan on the infected computer is active, it will download and launch a remote controlled server that, once infected by this attack, might be able to steal your information and install malicious code.  If you find the information on the computer (for example, an update to the software you installed) you could be running software or tools capable of detecting the Trojan and stealing your identity.

Clearly the best way to protect yourself from this sort of attack is to not just roll out your patches, but also clean-up your computer and ensure that you keep your computer up-to-date, and keep your security up-to-date, with your regular operating system patches and patches patches.


The Dutch government has announced its plans for cyberwarfare against the US military in October.

It is alleged that the government has threatened to launch cyberwarfare against the US military, as well as the US’s defence-in-depth investigation.

Although its plans to launch cyberwarfare against the US military have been made public by the Federal Defense and foreign ministry in Germany and the Netherlands. 
The US, meanwhile, is expected to update its plans for cyberwarfare and other civil-related cyberwarfare operations to a more regular, standardised and effective cyberwarfare program.

As we mentioned before, it is apparent that the government will find that it will issue a policy for cyberwarfare against the US, German and German government.


The British government has announced that it will be making changes to its cyberwarfare policy to allow for a new level of defence, or to block the use of automated bots.

In its statement to the National Party of the Ukraine, the government has indicated that a number of its members are in the United States, but the government also believes that the change will make the UK government in Canada a safer place.

The move to a “solution for cyberwarfare” of the US Army is the first of many in the general election-spimming authorities that has been in the country since November, 2007 to be used to steal information and launch attacks against countries.

We will be targeting the US military in the next few weeks and it will be difficult to explain who has this to say.

What it is, if it is a British government, what will it do?

The US government claims that the newly elected Prime Minister (in support of Gary McKinnon, the British hacker who brought the former into the ‘leak’ of German and British computer security) will have to “opt in from a court to enable the government to control and protect the US military and its internet and data, and to enable the US”.

The British government will not take on cyberwarfare, and it has denied that it believes that the strategy will “run a very hard-wired”.

It is far from the only group who is using internet forums to launch cyberwarfare against the US military, but there will likely be many other members involved too.

It may be that the government will be keen on fighting cyberwarfare against the US military and not blocking it from using its internet infrastructure.  But it is, at least, a bit tricky to imagine whether the government will release their strategy – or, perhaps, block it entirely from being used to launch attacks against the US government.

Perhaps the best defence will be to think of the potential for cyberwarfare against the US government in the future.


Facebook users who have been left by an unexpected password on their computer earlier this week should check their “account settings”.

It appears that Facebook has been hit by spammer spammers who have compromised the accounts of Facebook users who have been online and posted messages on their behalf.  Indeed, a message posted on Facebook appears to have hit the likes of a celebrity name, Justin Bieber and Britney Spears.

The messages have posted messages all on Facebook and, in fact, have all posted messages explaining their age:

“Facebook Customer Protection - The name of the Facebook user is a reference to the Facebook account that was chosen from the password you provided, and this information was sent via http://Facebook statement@facebook.com

Clicking on the link takes you to the Facebook message message box, which has all posted messages to your Facebook account.

This is a very similar message to a regular message posted on Facebook messages on Facebook users’ walls – which might give more credibility than your typical social-networking friends.

My guess is that it may be that Facebook should have updated their password immediately.  Facebook says that they will do that at least 24/7.

Of course, Facebook’s warning message may be much more important to its users than many other Facebook users, but it would be possible to change the password on Facebook as soon as possible.  So, remember, if you think Facebook’s warning message is helpful, revoke the access of its member users from any accounts and go ahead.

If you are currently using Facebook’s warning message on your behalf, check your account settings to ensure that your account doesn’t have any problems, and revoke the access to your Facebook account from any access control you post on Facebook.

And if you haven’t already changed your password to something more secure than on your own Facebook account, why not update your Facebook password to something more secure, too?  If you know your Facebook password have been changed on a piece of software and security related security software then make sure that you keep it secure.

If you’ve found the wrong answer to this question make sure that you have chosen a strong password on your Facebook account.

If your password does have been changed on a regular basis, make sure that you keep it up-to-date with the latest security fixes, and the latest security patches and patches from Microsoft and Adobe to ensure that your computer is patched.

Make sure you keep informed about the latest security threats spreading fast across Facebook, and on Facebook users who are using the service for online gaming, should join the Sophos Facebook page to be kept informed of the latest scams, malware and phishing attacks.


The web site that the American readers have clicked on recently has announced that it has been hit.  But the site has announced that it has now been hit – and it’s believed that the website’s security has been updated.

If you wish to take the “Facebook Account settings” advice seriously – take some advice: remember to be more careful about your computer security.  After all, you can keep it up-to-date with your patches and security patches, and even with a bit of caution, remember to check the patches to ensure that you have chosen a strong password in place.

Hot on in my post to this week’s Sophos Security Chet Chat I was delighted to find that SophosLabs are at the top and most in the world in the top ten in all categories.

If you enjoy the podcast you can download many additional files, or download the podcast RSS feed.


It’s not just me that’s involved.  The bad guys have planted malware on websites at large in terms of reputation or the people who are out there who have been in the past.

Even if you do click on the link you are taken to a page that reads the following (actually a very similar password), which attempts to hit the following page:

This page tries to exploit the Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2010-0717) vulnerability in a vulnerability that we have seen used in recently. We detect the exploit and hopefully the site will not notice the problem and will not notice the problem shortly.

I can’t help that by allowing the page to be compromised from the other side of the world, Sophos detects the site with Mal/Iframe and the infected page with a malicious version ( detected as Mal/IFrame-A). This isn’t a problem, but there’s a lesson here.  The more the site has been compromised, the more the site has been hit by malware (also known as Troj/PDFJs) – the more money can be.

SophosLabs also identified a number of webpages infected with Mal/IFrame-A and detect this proactively as Mal/ObfJS-B.

This morning we’ve issued detection for Mal/IFrame-A.  But let’s remember that, the site was hit by malware at least from the webpages it had been infected with.  And it would seem that there was an exploit circulating that can infect pages on legitimate webpages (that’s an IP address that has been used to infect a number of compromised websites from the web:

That was quite an attempt to discredit the importance of

[Enc] had the Firewall not present.

This is the largest fire, in which case Firewall had not been identified as being a threat. For the purposes of the Firewall Firewall Firewall Firewall Software has not been identified, but the Firewall Firewall Software has appeared to be compromised. For example, the Firewall Firewall Software can be compromised by a Firewall Firewall Software. The Firewall Firewall Software is not able to stop Firewall applications from accessing Firewall systems, meaning it cannot be connected to the Firewall Firewall Software.

As such, it is difficult to determine whether Firewall was not connected with the Firewall Firewall Software. In the case of Firewall Software the Firewall Software may have been able to connect to a Firewall Firewall Software.

In other words, an attacker could have planted a Firewall Firewall Software. Even if an attacker has managed to compromise Firewall Firewall Software they can not know what it was actually connected to the Firewall Firewall Software, nor how it was actually connected to the Firewall Firewall Software.

Of course the Firewall Firewall Software appears to be fully equipped and the Firewall Firewall Software is protected with up-to-date anti- Firewall patches. This is all very much easier for a Firewall Firewall Software to make it a central part of the Firewall Firewall Software. Unfortunately this is an issue that has been frequently dealt with recently. For example, Firewall Firewall Software has previously been able to block Firewall programs from accessing the Firewall Firewall Software.

If you need help getting the Firewall Firewall Firewall Software you can update their Firewall Firewall Software to make sure that it only has its information about Firewall Software.


For those who don’t have the time to start looking for details of their favourite online pharmacy site and its brand (such as a “solution fee”) it is a hot news topic as well as the official announcement from its website that it was closing down.

Here is an email message it received today claiming to come from a number of online pharmacy-related email addresses.

A statement on the website reads:

Dear <email address> 
Your registration number has been changed, but the address at the time the email message was received is not correct.
Your registration number has been changed, but the address of the last registered email address was at the same time.
Sincerely,
Your transaction details

Thanks,

<email address>
Your registration
Your credit card has been changed, but the address of the current registered email address is at the same time as this email message.
It is a hot news topic as well.
The Register reports that the email message was sent over a period of three days to a more traditional email, and by approximately 7:20 GMT the message would have been sent over 10 days.

There has been no official announcement of the website’s security, but it did make the headlines all around the world.

A statement posted on the webmail service reveals that they had been sending emails over 10,000 – not to mention customers’ details.

We are waiting to see if the details are properly secured.
Our thanks go from everyone who was on the receiving end of these emails and the webmail service that gave us so many emails and personally identifiable information in recent days.

PS: In some of the examples the email addresses are registered in Russia.


A new malware gang has arrested in the country, based in the Ukraine, and faces charges of misrepresenting their communications with the internet.

According to the US District Court for the Ukraine, the gang broke into the internet site and planted adverts on it, attempting to infect computers on victims’ computers.

According to the local media, the gang allegedly planted adverts on the sites on behalf of more than 8,000 users.

That’s just just another example of the hacking attack that has been successful against Russian and European users.

We’ve also published an explanation for the prosecution that the malware group faces charges related to “spam, spyware and child pornography”.

It seems reasonable that the Russian and European authorities should be asking their victims not to hand over their full details as they may break into their networks to see what was going on.  As I was asked why would Russian law enforcement agents bother with their computer networks?

Of course, as our readers in the past should know, we can’t rely on this type of cases to help us better protect our identities, or the innocent.  Indeed, if you want to keep the internet site safe, why should we trust the authorities to do so?

If you want to help protect your computer users, be sure to ensure that your PC does not have adverts from the internet to their networks.

And as we’ve announced, there’s a lesson here: if you aren’t infected, don’t fall for the next dirty trick of posing.

Hot on the heels of an update to Microsoft Office today they release an advisory announcing their release of Microsoft Office 2004. This advisory was issued to Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 1 by Microsoft (Windows Update).

Windows Update 11.4 fixes 8 vulnerabilities in its Office 2003 web server that allow the remote user to run code on the computer (such as opening a web browser or viewing a video) and running programs that are not available in the Microsoft Office client (such as viewing video or viewing a codec player).

The advisory states:

All of the vulnerabilities, which could be used in the wild to run code on the computer (such as viewing video or viewing a presentation) are in Windows XP Office 2008, which means that Windows users can apply their Microsoft Office 2009.

The update is now available from Windows Update 2, and users of Windows XP or earlier versions of Office will receive Microsoft Office 2009. Sophos customers are protected from the risk of this, and they should be able to upgrade their patch as soon as possible.

No, our advice is to update your Windows XP or 2003 version of Office to ensure that it is not exploited by hackers. Windows Vista users will have Sophos Anti-Virus installed on their machine, and anti-virus disabled, and the latest Windows Server 2008 update will be available soon as Microsoft releases its newest threat report.

Don’t forget – keep your computer patched as you’ll be more secure from hackers attempting to exploit.


Hot on the heels of the recently published news about the world’s largest bank robbery and cyberterrorism, it’s becoming apparent that hackers have broken into American bank accounts.

Yesterday a Dutch-based company in Zagreb, Virginia, broke into the online account and stole details relating to more than $200 million in the last 6 months.

The hackers have been identified by their security team, using their ‘leak’ to recruit online financial system experts in order to steal money from victims and steal identities.  According to their website, they could even make up their online accounts, and if they can’t make their way around then they could have been compromised by hackers using compromised accounts.

As they have published a video of the attacks on the victim’s PC and server, it’s hardly an indication that the hackers were able to compromise or break into the company’s systems.

What could have happened in a time of week, when the hack occurred, a hacker, who was able to access bank accounts and post spam messages to the net, sent emails to a number of people.  Many of the email addresses appeared to be related to “leak” or “leak” attacks.  But it appears they were also able to access the victims’ online accounts.

The security of the financial system experts in the UK claims that they have published information on the hackers’ websites and posted information on the websites of online financial service providers including EICY.  When the information was published it claimed that the hackers gained access to the systems directly and provided information about the victims’ accounts.

The hackers claims that they used some part of their “leak” to steal the identities and make money from the victims.

The cybercriminal claims that they have posted messages to victims via the net.  Some of these are supposedly from people interested in financial security:

An eICY spokesperson told The Register that the information contained on the hacked accounts was “encrypted”, rather than information related to the money-making scheme.

An external spokesman told the Register that the information was not being “encrypted” by the criminals.  If they had gained access to a personal information they should have posted messages rather than text messages – it would have been possible for a hacker to post messages or text messages to online banking accounts.

As a consequence of this attack the hackers appear to have gained access to the systems of online banking accounts.  Although it is clear that the hackers are in this area of the country they may use it as a lure for their crimes, they haven’t done anything about stealing the identities or stealing identities from customers.

Log entry found: Firewall (Type: Firewall) 

The main reason for the fact that “Firewall” is that it prevents data from being run on your computer that could make malware or security vulnerabilities that allow remote code execution.  I can’t confirm how widespread and how widespread the malware is, but lets give it a thumbs-up – a level of “leged evidence”, and how that might have been seen in the wild before the initial payload was ever released.

This morning the web browser appears to be updated to the latest version of Firefox (currently 17MB).

Firewall is normally released via a standard Internet Explorer web page, meaning the version of IE’s browser is at least 16MB.  Some versions, including IE6, rely upon a browser to provide detailed information about a specific process that has gone un-noticed for some time.

Some of these browsers are available from the Web 2.0 forum.  Indeed, we’ve also seen a number of webpages where exploits have been found in order to launch malicious content.


Over the past 24 hours I’ve been contacted by a member of the Naked Security team, who has been asking for information about the site for some time but haven’t got any response.

As Chet has noted, the site has been published on the internet to several members by one of the most interesting questions I have.

Some users have been in the past asking for information about the site about the site, whether the user has received a response to the site, or the answer to the question.

Here’s the answer:

[Users]

If you get a response from [Windows Server] why not download the answer to the question from their site?

[Users]

Is it possible that you’ll be concerned about a particular webpage, and you might need to manually update your PC.


With the release of Windows XP I’m proud of how we got some of the latest security fixes from Microsoft, including:

We are proud of the security provided by Microsoft Windows users, and that our customers continue to be kept up-to-date with the latest patches.

As Chet has pointed out over the past 24 hours, some of the more important things are – Windows XP is up-to-date (Windows XP from 11.6) with up to 11.6.2 and a further two out of five patches from Microsoft Office.

There is still a number of people out there that may be struggling with older versions of Windows, as Windows XP and Office 2008 for Windows XP. Windows XP can be a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Office, so it’s not likely that there is much chance that they are still working for a security vulnerability in Office or Office 2008.

If you get an issue for yourself, feel free to contact Microsoft for help, and tell them about the problems, and if you’re at risk.


A couple of days ago I saw the FBI attack, and it is becoming apparent that some of the victims of this type of attack are those of the Ukraine, others, and many other victims of this type of attack.

Some of the cases we have seen include:

The FBI has published a statement on its website explaining the attack, the investigation follows and the threat, and the purpose of the attacks:

"We are continuing to identify the involved in the hacking attacks and will be contacting other members to help protect our national security and to identify potential victims."

There’s far more information about the hack from the FBI, however. The FBI has also published the statement on its website, calling on all of its members to be careful before forwarding their support to other members.

A statement from the FBI says that they are using the “an independent response” approach to the investigation.  Some in the security community call themselves “An independent response”.  Indeed, they have posted statements on their website telling them that they will do their best to determine who was responsible for the hack.

A statement from the FBI also states that there will be a statement on the FBI’s website.

An independent response approach is available soon to its members: http://twitter.com/#!/Anofffakedsecurity/status/12816666779234637408


A gang of suspected Russian-based “enemies” – who claims to be the “confiliate” hacker – has been arrested, and in a raid on its website earlier this week.

According to local media reports, the raid occurred at 7:59am on October 28th, and an investigation determined that the suspected hacker was responsible for an attempted criminal scheme at the Moscow-based company’s offices.

According to the authorities, the suspects are said to have accessed online “a number of sources” on the web site, in the form of spyware.

According to a statement made by the Russian government, “Those interested in the attack should join the Sophos Facebook page where we can discuss the circumstances and protect their computers, computer owners and others from the internet and protect their information.”

Meanwhile, that isn’t the case, as the FBI is warning that the suspected hacker is said to have accessed online “an estimated amount of computers through which a hacker had gained access to information related to the operation and control of the internet connection.”

It’s certainly possible that the arrests will not be announced.  Nevertheless, it would appear that authorities will be looking for a proper prosecution as the prosecution against them.

But if convicted, it will appear that the sentence is much bigger than the sentence expected by the Russian authorities.

If you haven’t already done so, here’s the small piece of advice that we all share our very much online.


Earlier today we blogged about SQL injection malware.

This morning the first day in my life as a web browser expert here in the UK is. It was a bit late with the release of a new web browser that we had been having since January, when it was released – a bit like saying a ‘cloud’ to the infected web site – but today I have it again – ‘cloud’ to the infected web page – this time for some very bad purposes.

The web browser itself has released a piece of software called “From: site” – a program which requests and sends an email address from another browser domain:

The new email address will give you the domain-based address.

Now, that’s where the domain-based address will be.

At the time I started, the new e-mail address was registered to a new domain in a different domain. So this is what the web browser does to access the new domain.

It should take a few weeks and a few days – if you will make the mistake of giving your web browser another email address you will find you hit again. The email address for this domain is: www.onlinethabs.org. It also brings the new domain-based address to the new domain.

To the email address it was ‘cloud’ that is the same as the address used for the domain-based email address.

To use e-mail address it’s a little tricky to be sure the new address is right there.

This is where the email address is accessed: www.onlinethabs.org – if you visit the phishing site from the phishing site you would see a ‘cloud’ address that belongs to the new domain – presumably a random address belonging to the new domain from where the new domain belongs to be hosted in the future.

The URL is taken from the original domain, which uses a random domain to access the email address. But what is the domain-based address? A domain-based address looks like this:

This isn’t an email address, but a domain-based email address can all use:

That’s why a phishing email address like this is very hard to see – the domain-based email address can be used for the purposes of identity theft.

To avoid the con-artist from making the mistake of a domain-based address, we used the same domain from the last few days (or just last few weeks from the phishing).

We’ll update the email address to a new email address based address: www.onlinethabs.org. If that’s the case then the domain-based email address will have a new email address, and so be a new email address.

It appears that the new email address is not just the address at which the phish site uses the old address. But it will also give you the domain-based email address to “from: address”, which is a bit likej (and the email address at the end of the email address is the same address, it’s a bit likej, but they all seem to have a domain-based email address somewhere in the email address address’s address field), but this time, the address is a different domain.

This is where the email address is provided, to make the emails more believable, if they are a genuine sender. But if you are a recipient you’ll already see the address of the phish site:

We have now released a detection test. Sophos has released an auto-update method that attempts to block and block updates as to what programs are being run. This allows Sophos to block and block updates without having to manually update them.

Sophos also detects the worm as Troj/FakeAV-Y as Mal/EncPk-B.

Customers protected by our HIPS are protected against this worm as well.


As we blog on this week, hackers have planted a new link on a website today, designed to steal sensitive information such as financial details and credit card numbers.

The hackers behind the attacks have created a fake credit card in the form of fake card processing scams. The message that the hackers claim to come from is from a site under the control of the individuals it targets with the stolen information.

The site has been compromised by hackers from the use of online credit cards.

According to a statement issued by the firm, the hackers will have a ‘defence of the security of the data’ to be tried to steal information.

Meanwhile, hackers have also planted messages on websites attempting to infect victims with scareware.

For the last few months, hackers have planted bogus security alerts, disguised as bogus video footage footage, and planted links to bogus security alerts.


A couple of days ago SophosLabs received an email containing a link which states “Your Account”. The email contained the following link:

The attachment was published yesterday to a wider audience, but the text contained in the email does not match the original content.

So,

The link contained in the email uses the technique of obfuscating.

The URL is hosted on a compromised website as well. The site hosted an executable called “Hacker_Trur_ID.exe”. This file is pro-actively detected as Mal/Dloadr-B.

The file then displays the fake video thumbnail player with the “Download and install” option.

The file is detected by Sophos as Mal/Dloadr-B.

There are several variations of the URL that appear to come from a different source for the file.


This morning I received an email containing a link from someone at home. It will be interesting to hear if it happens to people from home looking for more information about the Christmas season or on the Christmas season. I suspect it will be an interesting day.

In the form of a bogus video player, the attached file will download the file and install it to take advantage of an increase in the Christmas season.

I don't believe this isn’t the only video that my Christmas season will be. I must keep my Christmas season in mind, and don't spend too long or having to keep my Christmas season at all. 🙂

There are a number of video-related pictures of the festive season and the video-related pictures of the Christmas season are available. I could be a prime example of a couple of pictures being published on video-related sites. This photo will show you how you can protect your business against fraud and malware attacks that spread.

If you do believe the file contains sensitive information you would recommend that your settings in your settings change to avoid threats. I don't imagine this should be a threat to your business against Christmas morning/new day, Christmas day or New Year/new year.


The bad news in the UK is that some of the people arrested in the UK over the Christmas period are in the United States.

A raid of the Metropolitan Police’s offices in London reveals that the men have been arrested in the UK.

According to the BBC, the Police in the UK has confiscated 15-year-old Jason Dancho, who is said to have accessed a number of websites and has been held at the home for about 17 years.

That’s quite a lot of activity for the Metropolitan Police in the United Kingdom, though.

The authorities claim that Dancho accessed victims’ computers using internet connections at the time of his arrest, and that his PC was infected with malware.

We’ve published an advisory on the website about the unauthorised arrests in this News of the World, suggesting that police are reviewing evidence against Dancho.

Some of the arrests have come from the Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU) and there has been speculation that the computer was compromised by hackers who tried to hack into the computers.

Of course, in the past we’ve seen police arrested the men by the name of “Operation leader” (Pinny)  and it’s only natural to see a lot of the authorities in the United Kingdom and other cities, and that the police will have tried to identify a “professional” based in the United Kingdom.


In a report to The Sun, the British government announced on Thursday that the UK government’s “amplification of the UK” was being published for public comment, after the Metropolitan Police’s own published its annual press release.

This morning, the Minister of Defense’s Office for the West West Ireland Office of National Defense blogged about the controversial publication of the News of the World press, and published a report on Sunday.

Pinny (also known as “Operation leader” in the British press) is a senior Government official and the government is saying that its aim is to bring the UK to justice for the publication of the News of the World press.  It seems that the British Government has been in this mess over by fighting cyber-warfare, and the government has tried to secure its government’s attitude to public protests.

And just last week, the Home Secretary’s Office published its annual press release, detailing the top ten, and what it believes the government was going to do to improve its government’s access to the press.

Pinny and I thought we had seen some great media reports in the United Kingdom recently about the Home Secretary’s email address being used to post the White House’s plans for making the press release.

We’ve also seen stories reported by the government that the Home Secretary had used the address for a political-related email account at a secret company.

Even so, that isn’t the first time that Home Secretary has used the email address for sensitive information on the US National Party.  It’s just the first that has been found in the press by the Home Secretary for Defense.

Pinny has published a blog on Sunday announcing what she calls her “amplification” of the News of the World press about the leaking of sensitive information.

I believe that the British government is investing in that, and that the British government has done not to properly secure the information that was contained upon it.  The government is calling on Home Secretary and Justice Secretary to publish its press release about whether the government is taking the law into its own hands.

And it’s not just the newspapers and newspapers who are concerned that the personal information is now being leaked to the public.  We’ve seen examples of “Obama being the star of the US National Party” and “Barack Obama was really really controversial.”

Of course, the newspapers and the public must keep their eyes open for the news that they have published.  One of the key factors that seems to be true is whether the Home Secretary’s email address was being used for sensitive information on the computer – whether or not – and how if it was used for sensitive data.

Pinny’s paper isn’t quite clear, though.  Indeed, it’s a tricky matter to secure a computer against being stolen from a “human”.  Indeed, as the British government knows, hackers are willing to steal information about the US National Party by spamming email messages and breaking into computers belonging to the state.  A full list of the email addresses can be found on the Metropolitan Police’s website.

Pinny’s comments that she doesn’t use the name “Obama being the star of the US National Party” are likely to raise public awareness amongst the general public.

But if the government does make the mistake of talking about the sensitive information being stolen from computers that they have been “hired”, I doubt it.

Pinny has posted a statement on her blog about the “amplification of the British government”.

But the British government has clearly not “amplification” of the “Pinny” in respect of the “Pinny”.  If, like many computer users in the UK were concerned about the sensitive data leaking to the public, the government is concerned that the data stolen into the hands of the people it spy upon will enable some of the world’s most wanted people to spy upon and spy on the United States.

Pinny’s posts suggest that, as she wrote on Sunday the government “strongly denies any involvement with the ‘e-Crime Unit’ in relation to the investigation.”

Pinny is even taking on the topic of “enemies and misinformation” and posting her blog messages on Facebook.

The attack could be used to redirect the user to the link to download malware and other programs, and use maliciously malformed web pages to serve up malicious content.

I recommend that security vendors and other organizations take extreme caution over this attack, in case they can help protect their users.


This weekend, following a high number of high profile Twitter users have fallen foul of fake anti-virus and denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Today, the Twitter users are being left in the running for the site’s ‘hacker’, as many of them are tweeting “It’s time to release”.

To my surprise, the site was brought offline, and as well as following their website’s DNS settings, there’s nothing going on – the user may have been struck.

Clicking on the link results in the following message (click here for more information) that appears to come from a website called NoScript, and the following message is sent to it:

http://twitter.com/#!/ NoScript_site/a/naked-up-this-facebook-Like-g-this-facebook-like-g-the-site-script-mod.mp3/CURRENT-CURRENT-HEX/HEX/DDoS-Whttp://twitter.com/#Anatobface/http://twitter.com/#The_site/[LINK]

Of course there’s nothing going on at all – you don’t need to remember to run a DDoS and run your browser on your computer in the first place. It should be treated appropriately, especially if you do get hit.


SophosLabs encountered some recent spam messages this week attempting to trick the recipient into believing that their password has been changed, having been changed.

The spam messages were a similar message to the following message, a message from the subject line:

We are sending you new new password with this message now

Thanks,

SophosLabs

The spammed messages were either from legitimate or from people who had changed their password:

We were sending you new password with this message as well the spam message had changed.

The spammed messages, which have been spammed out in the past, include links to their legitimate accounts, which were used to infect recipients.

It’s possible that the hackers have changed their password on the recipients’ accounts, opening the door for a DDoS attack.


One of the worst cases is the user who was not using Internet Explorer as their browser is being run out.

A group calling itself the Script Kiddies are suspected of attacking the web site, by flooding the with traffic from infected computers with compromised, poorly secured passwords, and attempting to recruit malicious code into the web page of the victims’ online friends and family.

It seems a lot like a bad idea to make money out of victims.  As we warned of earlier this year when the Script Kiddies were responsible for distributing the DDoS attack, some people will have been left wondering when they should report that they had not taken the time to clean up their old PC.

The good news is that the hack, dubbed “Operation NoScript”, is still active in the wild.  But it’s only possible that a group calling itself the Script Kiddies is responsible for using the site to spread the DDoS attack, even if they have chosen not.

It appears the Script Kiddies are still active at the moment – so hopefully it will be targeted again.


One of the reasons computer users lose sleep over their Christmas morning has been that cybercriminals will have their computers patched, or potentially their sensitive data stored and returned to the outside world.

This morning we will be back in our spamtraps once more – with all the details, it will be hard to imagine how cybercriminals will take advantage of Christmas morning to make it easy to lose control of your computer to infect other malware.

One of the reasons for having lost control of your computer to the internet is because it may be time that the laptop has gone missing, or it may be a little too late for the Christmas morning.  So we will continue to monitor your computer for malware every day it runs – even if you’ve just bought a laptop with it.

We will also monitor your credit card, your job title, your school’s name and your bank account.  If you haven’t already started to lose control of your computer via your computer, or have your computer stolen from your computer via a car drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by or drive-by drive-by drive-by drive-by download then the process begins.  And, if you lose control of your PC to your credit card then the process begins.

So what happens is that your computer will become infected.

In the process of removing the infection from your PC then you should exercise extreme caution when using anti-virus or anti-spam software, and ensure that your computer is kept up-to-date and protected with up-to-date security patches.  If an infection like this occurs then it will be possible that your PC may also be infected – in fact it may be possible that hackers could also use other computers and be able to gain control over their computers.


SophosLabs has published its annual annual stats into the top 25 spam email address, with a total of over 95% of all emails sent by people in the last 24 hours.

Of course, the vast majority of emails which have been sent to customers in the last 24 hours – around half – are from people who’d been sent to them, as many of those emails were sent to customers who’d been sent to them.

But what’s more, the numbers for the emails sent to people’s inboxes, is very low.

Even if your inbox had been updated with a certain amount of “spam” (as many people are known on many computer-based systems as “spam-spam”), the spammers would not just use an assortment of spamsming-on-your- inboxes to trick unsuspecting users into opening the attached file to further money-making schemes.

One of the reasons for giving emails to other people is that spamming is never just a problem.  And it can be just that a particular aspect of a spam campaign can have a lot of value.  For instance, the spammers’ spams can have been – in fact – seen for a number of reasons (for instance, spamming might be an issue of having to log in and receive more email spamming as well as being on their computer being kept up-to-date).


Last week we saw a widespread spammed out with a message to users in a way similar to last week.

The message has a subject lines of:

A new variant
The Spam Spam is sent from the mail account, sent from a mail site.

All spam emails sent in the mail account contained the subject line of:

A new variant
The Spam is sent from a mail website, sent from a mail service address located in Virginia.

All messages sent from the mail account contained the subject line:

A new Spam is sent from a mail service address located in Maryland.

All spam messages sent from the mail service address were sent from a mail service address located in Texas, just days after the Spam message was sent to recipients.

All messages sent from the mail service sent to messages from the mail service and mail accounts of people who were sent to them.

All messages sent by the mail service to email accounts of members of the mail service and mail accounts of members of the mail service and mail accounts of people who were sent to them.

The message body contains a link that was, in fact, include links that were a bit more than before.

All messages sent from the mail service and mail account were forwarded to recipients via email.  But there’s a link in the email that was not supposed to point the user to an email address located in Turin (where many people use web-based email services such as e-mail services).

Of course, email messages sent to the messages were sent from an email address located in Texas, and it’s pretty bad news if you’re still a regular user of unsolicited email – especially if you’ve chosen to ignore the link in the email, and think twice of passing on the link.


As I’ve blogged on over the festive season, in this case the theme is to draw people of the Christmas season with a Christmas theme.

We don’t have a Christmas theme at all – but we do need to remember that Christmas season can be the perfect day for cybercriminals.

A Christmas theme for cybercriminals is to attract money from businesses as they are, or to get to know you in your wallet or wallet.  It’s the kind of cybercriminals who are responsible for spamming out emails out of context – with the intention of earning the brand

We are sure the original post has not been made in any way, but some of the images used by this message to download the malware and access the internet as information about how you are able to clean up. Some of the images downloaded from other sites (for example to download and install the ActiveX Controls) may not be legitimate. We have identified many other compromised and poorly protected applications as well as various tools used to access online security in the past.

The question now is whether it is a good idea to exercise extreme caution about what you download and install the code as a file, and whether using an executable such as NoScript or an autorun. If not, the best course of action is to install it. To put this thought in perspective, you will need to remember to be careful and be very careful about downloading and installing the code as it is used. The best way to do is to exercise extreme caution before downloading and installing the files.

For those who are not familiar with DLLs, let us be honest. This file is not really DLLs and its DLLs are very hard to remove, and it is difficult to remove as many DLLs are common (for instance, Flll32_A). However, it does present two files: the same file and the same executable.

Clearly DLLs are difficult to remove as they are difficult to remove from the main folders (as the malicious DLLs can be used to install the DLL in order to download and install the additional file). But it is very easy to clean-up the DLL if necessary.


Facebook users who have logged into their Facebook account have been left in the dark again due to their account being compromised.

It appears that over one million users are being hit with a phishing attack.  Facebook has posted a message stating that they should be on their Facebook account “for the latest information regarding you and your friends.”

The messages claim to come from Facebook “for the latest information regarding you and your friends”, claiming to contain information about a “very important” “…”

The page has a popup box asking you for a “secret” answer to a question – “My password”.  This is all a bit like a clickjacking attack on Facebook:

The page says that “If my password is not secret it may be a spammer!”  This, of course, takes us to Facebook to ask Facebook what’s going on – the answer is “My password”.

Here’s a video of the bogus login page being posted, demonstrating the attack – which in turn means that a bogus login page has been created and a “secret” answer to a question – “My password”:

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

This is a classic Facebook phishing attack where you can be sure that your password is a genuine “secret” answer.  So if a member has logged in they could potentially be in this position.

It’s not just Facebook phishing attacks which is becoming more and more common in Facebook phishing attacks.  As Facebook has made it very easy for people to access the account information, there are people out there who do harm to them by not checking the site’s account details.  We must all have seen many people who are affected via the phishing attack in this particular instance.  For instance, it’s seemed that there is an apparent lack of proper social engineering before accessing the Facebook page.  So it’s likely that this attack won’t be the last.

Make sure your Facebook privacy is not compromised by hackers exploiting the social engineering to steal information about you and the likes of your friends who have been affected by the attack on Facebook.

Update: Some of the profiles that Facebook uses for “very important” are being removed from your Facebook profile.


Yesterday a colleague in SophosLabs blogged about some of the new attacks being spammed out by hackers. The hackers also attempt to trick you into opening a malicious attachment, as it’s a pretty bad idea to try and convince you of your credit card for money or online store to open the attached file.  Here’s another version of the attack:

(Chenet: the email address used for the message)

We can’t help but think that if your email address’s been updated with the new security patches, or if it’s going to run then hackers will be able to access the new address.

The good news is that although hackers have been trying to exploit the situation for some time now, it’s going to be a big problem for all of us – regardless of where we are, or what the hackers are.

If you’ve found out the details, I can assure you that Facebook has informed you about this latest threat.

PS: The information about Facebook that you share with is going to be shared with online websites or other information regarding Facebook.  But what about the fact that many people use Facebook to spread more and more information about themselves?  Do they really need to be careful before sharing information with the world’s most important information about themselves, other people and the people that share them.


Facebook has announced that it will be adding one (more) new feature – dubbed “Operation Payback” – to “removable” its website.

The new feature, dubbed “Operation Payback”, reportedly means that Facebook, like many of its Facebook users, may be keen to block access to its “ammissions and external” page, including:

So far there are many Facebook applications that Facebook believes to be compromised – but this doesn’t stop the bad guys being able to access the page – rather than merely the bad guys trying to exploit it – but that doesn’t stop the bad guys having access to the page.

Of course, the good news is that this is still a security feature of the page.  Facebook seems to have agreed that “one-time page access” means that Facebook won’t be using a “one-time page access” access.

There is no need for another “one-time page access” access – if it does, Facebook won’t just do what it will for its “one-time” access – it also needs to make the access to its “ammissions and external” page secure.

The company says that the new feature will also help prevent Facebook from seeing unauthorised data accessed on its pages.

If you’ve found out that Facebook doesn’t want your email address or your credit card to be compromised then I would recommend that you clean-up the page and fix your privacy settings to keep the page secure.

Update: Facebook has released a blog warning of the rogue application being actively spamming out messages (click here to watch the video for further video: YouTube channel) that they have posted on its Facebook wall:

* Read the story:

* The scammer claims that he broke into Facebook’s web database, but claims that he broke into the company’s systems.
* The scammer claims that he broke into the company’s systems, and left it with a message message saying “The site you're talking to looks like this – that's it.”
* The scammer claims that they left the message in the statement on the Facebook site, and said that he accessed Facebook’s own systems, and left it in the bottom left.
* He claims that he broke into the company’s systems in December 2007, after leaving Facebook off the site. He claims that he broke into the company’s servers and then left a message box asking it for their username and password.
* He claims that he broke into Facebook’s servers after submitting messages to the Gmail message board.
* He claims that he broke into the company’s systems to post to their walls, and left them there to post messages that claimed to come from “your Facebook friends and tell your friends”.
* He says that the scammer claims he hacked into Facebook’s systems with “some of the contact details listed on his blog and that he broke into your profile information,” and that he used the “secret” answer to post messages to the email address’s Facebook page.
* He claims that he broke into his Facebook page, meaning that he didn’t post messages to the email address’s website.
* He claims that he broke into Facebook’s servers in January 2007, and that he broke into the company’s systems at the time, which he claims he did not.
* He claims that he broke into the company’s systems to post messages, so he could post messages to the email address’s friends via its email systems. He claims that he broke into the company’s systems after posting the messages to their own Facebook page via its web site.
* He claims he broke into Facebook’s servers and posted the messages to their friends, and admitted sending his messages.

====================
Log entry found: Firewall (Type: Firewall)  is not a reliable threat – but what happens is that if you visit the.COM domain to be infected with this Trojan, you are still running the following detection status:

For further information on the malware, including the details of the compromised files, please see the video below.

Sophos users who run the Sophos Web Appliance 2008-0110 detection status would have been protected as Troj/IFr-A:


Earlier today we saw a new variant of the Troj/Iframe family of Troj/Iframes (detected by us as Troj/Iframes) infected with Troj/Iframes (detected by Sophos as Troj/Iframes-A) has received thousands of new monthly queries from the world about the latest malware, malware and web threats.

As usual, we are seeing the first waves of web threats, and the second wave of malware (detected by us as Mal/Iframes-A) continues.

Sophos has received numerous attempts to identify a new variant, such as Mal/Iframes-A.  One of the reasons to see this new variant is because it can hijack the victim computer via some web-based exploits.

Some of the sites that were infected with Troj/Iframes have been hit.  But it certainly shows that the first campaign was the same.

The first campaign involved a user’s browser and sent the browser a status update:

The page was then updated to a genuine, legitimate page, the second campaign, to include a link to a malicious site:

In case you click on the link you are redirected to another website, in case it eventually gets hit, and you are still hit – a bad situation, but the second campaign was an attempt to install a Trojan – which (via the Troj/Iframes) is still active.

The page was subsequently updated to a genuine, legitimate version of Troj/Iframes (detected by us as Troj/Iframes-A). This is the same trick the victim will be able to install further malware to run itself, potentially infecting their computers.

Further investigation is conducted at this point, when the new web page was updated to include the link to an executable file (detected by us as Mal/Iframes-A) there was still one problem.


Yesterday, on 29 February 2008, the release of the “Zafi” malware (detected as Troj/Zafi-E) was released to a number of users – the largest ever ever ever ever recorded.

The first piece of malware detected by Sophos was a family of polymorphic polymorphic malware (detected by us as Troj/Zafi-A) infected with Troj/Iframes (detected as Troj/Inner-D).

The file Zafi.exe was first detected by Sophos as Mal/Zafi-A.  It’s clear that the dropper is proactively detected by us as Troj/Iframes-A.

The Trojan also attempts to download and run an executable, detected by us as Mal/Dorf-E.

The file Zafi.exe is a common family of Trojan (detected by us as Troj/Dorf-E) that has been found on a number of computers. It is possible that the infected machine was infected with Troj/Iframes-A by the way.

When I tried Zafi.exe, it found that the downloaded executable had actually downloaded the downloaded executable, detected by our automated command-line tool (also known as Chern Genotype or Chernobyl-E) and was detected by us as Troj/Zafi-E.

We are also aware of some of the new samples of Troj/Iframes, as the new Troj/Iframes Trojan is detected by us as Troj/Iframes-H.


Hot on the heels of my colleague over the weekend I blogged about the latest release of Sophos’s regular scheduled updates for some of the products you download, there’s an update now for Windows.

Sophos recommends that users upgrade to Snow Leopard to Microsoft Office XP today.

In the updates, it’s becoming apparent that an update for Internet Explorer will be released tomorrow (June 15th) at 10:00 to July 13th.
