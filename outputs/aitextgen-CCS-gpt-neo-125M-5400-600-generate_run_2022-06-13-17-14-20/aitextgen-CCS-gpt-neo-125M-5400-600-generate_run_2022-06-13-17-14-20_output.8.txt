File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  a vulnerability:

By sending the message, we are the victim and we will be able to detect it, as this is the very message that we see every day. The response to this question will be ‘Free Software from Microsoft’. If not, then our analysis will detect it. For the rest of the world, our protection may have been used to detect malware on our systems. In the case of this worm, that is the correct response.

We are happy to inform everyone of the issue. The response will be to have all processes open and the details are available to the public. If you are not a victim of this worm, please wait. It will be interesting to investigate, take the answer to this question please receive the answer, answer the question to the question.

Update: We are currently asking the question to be answered by Microsoft. This is the most important answer to the question.

Update: We are looking forward to the next few weeks with the official answer.

Update 2: The question for the question was a bit strange. We will be able to deliver the answer here.

Update 3: The answer to the question is ‘Free Software from Microsoft’. The answer to the question is ‘Free Software from Microsoft’.

Update 4: The answer to the question was a bit strange and we will be able to answer this question correctly. We will be able to answer it.

Update 5: The answer to the question is ‘Free Software from Microsoft’. The answer to the question is ‘Free Software from Microsoft’.

Update 5: The question for the question was the same as last month’s most controversial spam campaign. It was a bit of a ‘leak’ in that particular spam campaign. And it was nothing like a ‘leak’ in that particular spam campaign, the link to that email site hosted in Russia.

Update 5: The question was quite familiar to the subject line and was probably the best place to go to the spammer’s database.

Update 7: The answer to the question is ‘Free Software from Microsoft’.

Update 6: A new answer to the question was:

Free Software from Microsoft will be able to answer the question in the following email address:

Thanks,
<email address>

All SophosLabs analysts will be interested in this one too

Update 5: The question to the question is a bit of a ‘leak’ but the answer to that question is ‘Free Software from Microsoft’. The answer is this question is this question should be answered by Microsoft.

Update 5: The question is now ‘Free Software from Microsoft’. The answer to the question is the answer to the question. It is possible that the answer to the question is ‘Free Software from Microsoft’.

Update 7: A number of the spammer’s email address was listed, presumably from an automated message. The answer to the question was ‘Free Software from Microsoft’.

Update 5: The question, “Free Software from Microsoft”, was again related to this message in the email address. And it wasn’t one of the spammer’s email addresses but the message body was quite similar to that of a previous spam campaign.

Update 7: A random number has been posted on the subject line. It is expected that the sender address listed in the message would not be valid and the message body would not have been a valid email address.

Update 5: The answer to this question was this question:

Free Software from Microsoft http://tinyurl.com

Update 6: The question for the question, “Free Software from Microsoft”, was “Free Software from Microsoft” and this time a random number (or in the case of a particular spammer) had been created.

All SophosLabs analysts will be interested in getting our users and other members of the general public to contact us via sophosblog@sophos.com


A gang in the United States has been accused of hacking into the network’s networks, using poorly-protected Windows computers to break into the networks of a number of cybercriminal.

The FBI, who investigated the case, announced on October 7 that hackers had managed to break into the networks of US government and financial institutions by infecting themselves with spyware, fake anti-virus, and money-making scams.

The authorities are said that in an article reported by the Wall Street Journal on October 7, hackers used malware to break into the computers of online financial institutions such as financial institutions, and make money.

Although the arrests have been denied, the hackers’ criminal activities are said to have exposed more than 1 million online customers, and made them at risk.

The Federal Court for the United States in London heard the story and announced on October 7th that a hacker could have broken into the computers of members of the “Anabank” group.

In addition to being named as a “important”, the prosecution also heard the names of two people accused of hacking into the computer network – Daniel M. J. Lynn, and Daniel M. Frost.

It appears that the two people accused of the hacking are related to an ongoing US presidential battle which hit the world’s leading anti-virus company, US Defense.

It appears that the two of these hackers – M. J. Lynn and Frost – stole details related to US presidential politics.

It’s possible that the hackers are also concerned that the US presidential race would have been in the news in the USA, or that the US Government’s support was not in place at all.

The first evidence claimed to have originated from the US President’s offices, but that the hackers had hacked into the computers of other US political parties.

Of course, some journalists and newspapers had been in the news headlines about the hack, but it seemed to me that some might find the case too serious.

One of the most important things to remember was that the suspected hackers of stealing sensitive information from the networks in the US were not in the US.

What’s worse – the hackers have claimed that the hacked PCs of US political parties were not in the US and that the hacking was done intentionally.  But they also claimed that the hack happened in Russia.

So, we believe that the hackers’ attempts to break into US military networks to break into US government networks is incorrect.

Of course, it is possible that if the hackers were using spyware to hack into the networks of the United States, or they were using poorly-protected Windows computers in the USA, hacking into US government networks is still very hard.

Regular readers of the Naked Security RSS feed will recall that we have been contacted by a number of members who have recently contacted our team via email.

I would recommend that users of Windows XP SP3 and older versions of Windows 7 SP2, Windows 7 SP3, and Windows 7 SP4, choose a non-Windows PC rather than an infected computer.

Update 6: We have received an email saying “Updated”. It appears to be an issue for those concerned about security.

Update 6: We have received a response from our support team:

[*] The attached file is now detected as Troj/FakeAV-E.

This isn’t the first time we have seen the malicious files in our database that cybercriminals have tried to infect computers. It seems to suggest that the files that were attached to a server that was subsequently infected by malware would have been compromised by malware.


Sophos has published its annual “Patch Tuesday” – a good time to remind those of you who don’t need to be a virus researcher.

The vulnerability has been patched in Windows XP SP3 SP4 SP3 SP4 SP3 SP3 SP1 SP2 SP1 SP3 SP2 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP3 SP2 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP7 SP1 SP2 SP8 SP4 SP6 SP5 SP8 SP2 SP8 SP4 SP2 SP6 SP4 SP9 SP3 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP9 SP1 SP9 SP1 SP7 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP5 SP1 SP1 SP2 SP5 SP3 SP1 SP4 SP0 SP4 SP3 SP4 SP4 SP8 SP8 SP1 SP6 SP4 SP4 SP6 SP4 SP1 SP3 SP5 SP1 SP5 SP4 SP4 SP8 SP2 SP8 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP3 SP5 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP7 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP5 SP1 SP3 SP6 SP4 SP5 SP3 SP8 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP8 SP1 SP4 SP4 SP5 SP4 SP3 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP4 SP1 SP5 SP8 SP4 SP2 SP4 SP4 SP3 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP9 SP1 SP2 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP3 SP4
====================
File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  this. If you did find this mistake it is possible to run an update from Microsoft to patch this vulnerability. If not then the patch is available. Please update to this Adobe Flash [CVE-1846].

There is some effort in the industry to have better proactive detection of a PDF file than to exploit the vulnerabilities. Sophos also have provided a guidance for configuring the software to ensure that a patch is not only available, but can also be installed, and to ensure that updates are not rushed out of the box. This is certainly a good recommendation.

We have blogged yesterday about the annual Pwn2own data release, and the recent outbreak of the Microsoft Office product, in the form of a worldwide patch for two-factor authentication (2FA).

The issue is, however, which often means that an email message has a direct link to a particular website.

Pressing an email message via MS-DOS is just one of the reasons why Microsoft Office is having problems protection from Internet Explorer as many malware emails and webpages.  Microsoft Office is not the only web service provider that supports Pdating, and a lot of that use HTTP POST requests, with multiple opt-ins.

If you use MS-DOS from Microsoft you can change your settings on MS-DOS from the “[Windows NT]” folder.  So if the system upgrade to MS-DOS doesn’t use an opt-in facility for email services, this problem could be caused by the malware infection of your system upgrade.

This morning we saw a number of email messages, all intended to be notifications from Microsoft in MS-DOS – we detect the attached file as a malware, the malware is proactively detected as Mal/Morto-A.   Clearly this was simply an attempt to generate some of the “infection” of the software, but clearly it should have been opened for analysis, and should have been seen when attempting to log into MS-DOS.  It would have been the mistake of a system upgrade having a copy of the files attached.

Pressing this issue and investigating the computer for an additional two days, it is very hard to resist the importance of properly securing your system – but we do have a good reason to use a free-to-update service such as an email provider to implement two-factor authentication.

For more information about the MS-DOS security problems can visit the website of MS-DOS.


For those of you who are running an older OS X product like Adobe Flash, Adobe Acrobat Reader and Reader 9 have been released on their website as Microsoft’s critical vulnerability Tuesday.

This month Adobe Flash is not one of the largest and most exploited vulnerabilities in the world in the past – we are seeing a widespread drop in the number of downloads a day in SophosLabs of 3GB.

Whether Adobe is making a decision to release Flash updates or not, be sure to check the Adobe Flash version of Adobe Reader and Reader 9.1 and Adobe Acrobat Reader for the first time. The vulnerability can be abused in the way the Java exploit code handles the vulnerabilities.

Of course, if you’re running a older OS X product you can always run Adobe Reader (7.8) before applying the update to Adobe Flash and running the current version of Adobe Acrobat Reader for Windows and Mac.

Update: Adobe’s release is now available for download as soon as we are able to install Adobe Flash into the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader and Reader 9.6.6 for Windows and Mac, for the Windows and Mac version.


Greetings to our users. If you’ve been following our blog, please read our blog for information.

There are some goodies I don’t want to share in the office. It’s one of the things we can do to improve our product’s security.


I thought it would be pretty good to update my blog over the festive morning. I did a check to see if some of my users had fallen for the internet at a survey website. The results would be the same as those we do a regular update to update my blog over Christmas morning.

In fact, in the last few days, I have been spending over 10,000 dollars on upgrades. The purpose is to improve the quality of my blog as it was, in this case, for those customers who have been reading my blog for almost 24 hours. But what I don’t have to say is, of course, that we haven’t really checked your computer with the latest update.

To do that, I have contacted many of the Naked Security team as my support team will be on their toes (as soon as the end of Christmas morning). One of the reasons for this is when someone else has visited my blog.

Now I’m off for lunch from my desk. The day before I am off at a meeting with an air ticket in the office:

I don’t know what happened, but I know if they’ve figured this out. My colleague in SophosLabs is a frequent contributor to the SophosLabs blog and if you enjoy his posts you might be too keen to hand over the details.

I don’t know what happened, but I know that cybercriminals are exploiting the information of its victims to post messages to their accounts. One such message, it’s me getting my news from the office:

The body of the messages appear to be from a young woman called Jessica Hill in her new city of Springfield. Next day the city will have a new look and the new look and the new look of the city will be in place.

The messages all seem to be from a young woman called Jessica Hill – her boyfriend and a colleague in her new town, although I guess the people at the City’s hospital are out now. So, in an ideal world, it would appear to be another man, perhaps in the city’s city who is going to be arrested.

I guess it would be better that an automated phone-infecting device would be used to send messages to somebody else’s address. The police will not know what happened, but it would be better to report the identity theft and the theft of your computer. If you do make a mistake and report the identity theft, remember to a police officer or a cops in the city where you want to get the information.

A closer examination on the original Facebook page reveals that the police claim that the phone-infecting was “identified through a computer and was a key role in the identity theft and identity theft of the people that made the phone calls, including their names and phone numbers.”

The police are saying that the alleged stolen property and related records were available for “over the period of the phone-infecting” from a number outside of the city’s city.

I think if you are a Facebook user – if you wish to ensure that your computer isn’t compromised, a “victim” or cybercriminal is already able to steal and commit identity theft – but that doesn’t mean it’s possible that there’s been an actual problem. If the details are, then they could have been stolen and stolen from people.

It’s a real problem, of course, that computer users are not necessarily being careful. And it’s true that hackers are using the mobile phone service service to steal information about themselves and their friends. This sort of problem is very low on the levels of the fraudsters who use the mobile phone service to steal money.

I think it’s just the kind of behavior that the Facebook users are interested in – where the hackers do not get hold of your computer.

So, the advice here is to keep your computer patched, updated and patched up-to-date, and keep your anti-virus updated. It’s also possible that, if you lose your mobile phone, or lose or lose your laptop, your online banking online banking might be at risk if the information is being held securely. (The only way to report this, is to get it.)

And if you lose your iPhone or iPad then you could be at risk of losing access to it. This kind of trick is much more sophisticated, of course, and we all know it – it’s bad news for everyone and it’s perfectly possible that it will be lost for one.

By the way, although it’s possible that cybercriminals are using more traditional methods of tricking users into believing the information is genuine – they have been using it as part of a scam to trick unsuspecting users into opening the attached file to potentially steal information about themselves and family members.


In a new spam campaign I have been monitoring a lot of websites in just one of several countries around the world, and so it would appear like if an individual or individual of those interested was in one of their websites then it would be a bad idea.

If you fell for this email, think twice before you click on a link in the email, as this could be of the form of a scam on one of the webpages it is on then the email messages.

And, if you fall for a scam like this go to many others – the more people

File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  a malicious payload but instead it contains a malicious downloader file.

Mal/Iframe-F is always detected as Mal/Iframe-F.


The news of the first malware attack on Facebook in the last 12 hours, by the likes of Adam and Mark Zuckerberg, is nothing new. It was only just the first time that the German website of the German computer company has been hit by cybercriminals.

To me, the problem was of course not just about the security of its web-based applications.

Facebook was hit with a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) in June of 2008, and the website of the German computer company were compromised by the hackers.

The attacks have been dubbed “Operation B”, and German computer users were left in the lurch as a whole.

Of course, it is very difficult to identify the link of the DDoS attack and its source, but it seems likely that the hackers are trying to point out more flaws in Facebook’s DNS-based filtering.

Of course, it’s possible that hackers have used the DDoS to hijack the computer’s DNS servers as well – if they did manage to compromise the website they could have planted more malware on their website and have struck many others with the result of the attack.

We would be very nervous that Facebook did not block the attack against its servers until February – but that’s going to be very serious.

There is no indication of the website being hit – a statement posted on the website suggests that it was protected with the appropriate filtering to prevent this attack happening again.

We have, however, taken some extreme measures to protect our website against the attack and will update the Facebook page to see which browsers are using the correct passwords.

Make sure that you keep your wits about you, and make sure that you keep up-to-date with the latest patches.

One of the interesting of the ‘news’ we have is that it seems we are seeing something strange today with some of the following (on multiple occasions) in the last week.

What’s particularly interesting is that in the past few weeks we have been seeing more malware in our spam feeds.

We’re now seeing a huge amount of new spam emails in the last few days.  For example, just last week we received a message that says that the user has been added to the ‘C’.

So, I thought that the email was an attempt at obfuscating the message so I was not able to make a difference on a new subject.


SophosLabs has received a number of new malware messages in our spam traps this week. This time we have received a new one in our labs.

First we receive messages like this:

File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  such a vulnerability as that a malicious payload is required.

It was announced by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office, who today published its annual report into the risk of malware.

The report is designed to help people identify and pursue cybercriminals in a responsible way – to make the case of their victims appropriately and stop them being put in their own hands.

The first two papers are expected to be delivered in March, 2010.

No personal details are lost, but it is clear that the report will help raise the profile of members of the public, and encourage people to keep their own computers security up-to-date.

If you haven’t already downloaded an update to the report, you can download the full version of the report via yourself.


Many people have been having a negative interest in online gaming scams, and so the threat of scams being brought to our attention is high and a number are growing.

With more and more users in the world over the Christmas period there is a new challenge.

With over one million users a new way to choose the better security of your computer you need to properly secure your computer with patches and anti-virus, but it is very difficult to do anything wrong.

I am looking forward to being the first person to have tried to log into my account to buy a Viagra laptop in the last day.


The spam messages I’ve seen in our spam traps today come from me.

Sophos detects the email spam messages in a number of different email spams.  Most of these spams are from a small company, as many people believe that spam is a good way to spamming out messages.

It may not be a nice idea.  For the most part, you can block the spam messages from all of the sender mail servers, but that doesn’t mean that those spamming lists are still present.

Of course, if you would like to block a mail site you must take the following steps:

File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  any ‘critical’


For those of you who are curious, the purpose of the attack, and what the purpose of the attack, is clear, though the first thing you encounter in the last few days, is the site’s source code.

We all know that attackers sometimes use obfuscated code (e.g. SQL injection techniques used in the CAST script) to construct web page scripts (e.g. webpages) but the more they work it has changed. We see lots of attacks in the last 2 months.

The question mark was ‘ why should the hackers bother to deliver?‘ and how can hackers have tried to make money?

And now, if you know a thing, then the answer is simple: it isn’t really there – you’d have to trust that someone else had accessed a page somewhere else to make it a legitimate page?

So what’s going to be done now is for you to clean up your browser’s content. And what’s going to be done?

I would like to have a go at sophosbloggers.


I think we need to have a bit of fun and geeks for the latest Adobe Flash and Adobe Reader updates, to convince you of their latest security fixes.

This week I’ll be sending out a greeting to the Adobe lovers, suggesting that they can’t wait a month to deliver a monthly bundle of patches.

Fraser Howard, the head of product and marketing at Adobe, is our technical support team at the Adobe offices to discuss all the latest fixes. You can also subscribe to them via their blog feed below.

All of Adobe’s vulnerabilities are in the latest PDF, PDF, and the Flash patches.


In a new spam campaign, I’ve received several emails in the past, seemingly from the firm of a “solution product” offering “Free tickets”. It has been the subject line for many users’ inboxes.

However, there’s a message in the email that they have received.  The body of the email looks similar to the following:

The email is quite legitimate, but I admit I won’t install you today, but the message is that I have chosen to ignore the parcel and receive this mail at some time. I know the sender’s address is not correct, but that they will post the message, hopefully make the message clearer.

The email itself is of a very obvious attachment, but the text does not contain the following:

Subject line:

Dear

Message body:
Good day to offer you with a daily parcel. I am the parcel from your address to this address.
We will send it today to your address at 1:00 (7-8-8-10), one of your other tickets (of course). You can send it to our address at 10:00 (7-10), one of the largest upgrades in our federal store in New York. Please let us know.

Sincerely to us in your address
Good day to offer us a daily parcel. We will send you back as soon as you have paid a monthly bundle (eg. 50,000).
Please let us know
Good day to offer us a daily parcel. We will send you back as soon as we have paid a monthly bundle.
We will update your address to this address.
We will update your address to this address for later, as this has been given a temporary suspend access. Please let us know if you are eligible.
Good day to offer you a daily parcel. You're entitled to receive a daily parcel (eg. 50,000) or a daily email (eg. 7 or 5,000,000) from your address.

Thank you.
The official email, which has a brand new filename, looks like this:

Good day,

File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  the details of the Cute-based attack as we have seen previously.

So, as we have now published the details of the latest attack, we will be able to deliver a better picture of the malware than usual.

There is a lot of talk about some of the ‘rooter’ and the ‘keyer’. It is the same as last week’s: ‘Anonymous’, ‘Anonymous2’, ‘Anonymous3’, ‘Anonymous2’, ‘Anonymous4’.

It is a bit of an oxymoron to discuss the infamous zero day vulnerability that made the headlines in January.

The topic was discussed earlier today and the focus of some media was a little more relevant.

It is not easy to believe the details of these vulnerabilities on the blog and I cannot tell you that a quick look at the source has found no evidence of that being compromised by anyone else. So if you are in the labs then you will have to look at their website and roll back the patches.

While we are waiting to roll out the patches for Adobe’s Flash Player 10.0 they do not provide a patch for this vulnerability they would recommend that Adobe patch released by Adobe to protect against this issue for Adobe Reader 10.5.2, or for its Acrobat Reader Reader 8.0.2.

To stay on top of what Adobe is doing, check out Adobe’s patches to learn about the security vulnerabilities that have been found in Flash Player.

Update Adobe has released a patch for this vulnerability as well as a fix for the problem and will also be available as an update to Adobe Reader 7.0.2 and Adobe Reader 9.1.2 to patch the flaw.


For those who haven’t heard of the malware authors the world would have been broken in this morning by a virus that attempts to spread itself via the “rooter” system.

Of course, most people would have been surprised and disappointed at the end of the month by the spread of the malware, as Troj/Iframe-F did not spread the payload to the user’s computer but it was possible that the original infected file was created via another infected file on the infected computer, in the last few days or so.

Some of the most interesting of these detections in particular came from Troj/Iframe-F.

The first thought of the morning was to come as the news was quiet, and the site was indeed clean.  On Saturday, the site was offline and I was able to access some of the data on the site.  The site has now been updated, but it did not seem to be carrying any further malicious content (detected as Mal/Iframe-F).

Sophos products detect the Mal/Iframe-F infection as Mal/Iframe-F.

The second thought was the site was broken into from a server at the back end of last week to a number of compromised websites. The first thought was “This is a virus in progress and you cannot do anything with your computer,” as the site was subsequently compromised. It was therefore not reported on the site and in its most commonly used for infected and malicious purposes, we could see the site’s website and any malicious content being referenced.

Another thought was a web page that was infected with Mal/Iframe-F. It was the result of a script that attempts to run on the infected computer with an infected computer, and then attempts to load and load a program and install a DLL. This DLL then writes the executable DLL to the infected computer, and a DLL and requests that the program and DLL it download will be executed, and in its name the program and DLL will be executed. When the program is executed, it sets the user’s “user and user interface password” to point to a file and then when the “user” password is entered from the “user account” to run it. This is a routine trick that is used to trigger the virus.

This has been another big effort at malware authors, having the subject line “Windows Media Hype”: “Good news…

We have found a malware authors with malicious intentions. This morning, we do not know the true purpose of the message, but we know the true purpose of the message.

If you look for more information about the malware authors you might want to check the  email addresses and the site in question.

Update: As you’ve already seen, the site has been down for quite some time.  The site appears to be back since August 28st 2008.


As we continue to release new malware, there are several interesting questions around it.

One is ‘How are we going to do that?’ This is one of the questions I have discussed over the years, including the question ‘Where are we?’

We are currently seeing a number of attempts to access websites that contain URLs that were not found. The site has been compromised and has been compromised.

Some of these are attempts to direct users to compromised sites via the web browser in order to infect them.

This morning, while reading the blog, I saw that a number of people are posting messages and the webpages I am currently visiting that are being published to various visitors.

It appears that the website has been compromised, and its DNS records were updated recently, allowing it to post to our spam pages and other popular spam.

A further investigation reveals that many of the people I have clicked on were posting links to a file called a spam page called a spam message.

What’s curious to me is how many of them are running Firefox, or how many are actually running Java?

This is obviously quite a bit of a problem.

Firefox 8, which Sophos has a number of Troj/JSRedir-R and has more information about, is currently being offered as a free download for those visiting. It may be a bit like the end of the month, however.

If you are a user of Firefox, please install Firefox’s new browser.  So, if you wish to install Firefox’s update, and install it as soon as possible, you should install the update and install Firefox’s latest anti-virus and security updates.

Update: Some users are seeing that a number of people are being redirected to a malicious site that was not previously blocked by Sophos.  So please do be careful folks.

Update: If you’ve downloaded the update, visit it now and see if it contains the link of a legitimate Firefox page, or if it was not before.


This week, we are back in full: the usual rules apply. But we can’t tell you this week when the last few days have been busy, there are still some great people out there, and it is not just people that can post spam.

As soon as we release malware, it appears that a very low number of malware authors have started to steal information from unsuspecting users through other malware authors’ websites.

And so the spam problem has been much bigger than we were expecting.  Here is the problem:

* Malicious content can be used in targeted attacks.

* A number of web-based threats are discussed.

* Some malware authors have used other products or services to steal information via web-based services like Google. The latest security in our proactive proactive report (also known as the SANS Threat Report) reveals that a number of compromised websites are infected with the malware – many of which are serving up a phishing scam.

* Malicious hackers’ webpages can be used to steal information from users of the “web” web site.

* There was another aspect in malware:

* Malicious activity is being used in targeted attacks.

* The latest attempts to steal data via search engine results.

* Malicious activity is being used in targeted attacks.

* The latest attempts to steal information via search engine results.

* The latest attempts to steal information via search engine results.

* The latest attempts to steal information via search engine results.

* The most interesting is to visit a website containing the last four months, last date and last week, IP address, and web-based browser and plugins.

* Malicious activity are being used to steal information via search engine results.

* Malicious activity is being used for web-based threats.

* The last 12 months, last month, and last week are all hosted on domain name associated with domains associated with.com and.inf.  I would have expected Google to have taken the bad news in mind if they believed that a website was responsible for the malicious attacks, or had been compromised.

* Malicious activity is being attempted against the.com and.inf site but it appears to be related to.inf.

* Malicious activity is being attempts to compromise the.com web site, and is being used in targeted attacks.

* The URL associated with the site is associated with the.com web-based malware campaigns.

* Malicious activity is being used to compromise the.com web-based malware attack.

* Malicious activity is being used to compromise

File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  a response message saying:

Pressing a browser window, which often includes the message:

"HKEY A Pressing the browser window, and I guess this might be a trick to get it through!

It appears to be more than you were thinking before, and for those of you reading this blog, thanks to the TK-22 who have brought me [LINK]

But it isn’t.

According to the blog, the user’s browser has a vulnerability (CVE-2009-054) which could allow hackers to steal the user’s browser.  Sophos has released an advisory to protect against this problem shortly (29 October).

The Firefox web page for the browser allows the remote hacker to install rootcode on the user’s computer.

To be more careful about Firefox’s security, check the page for information about vulnerabilities and avoid allowing unauthorised programs or scripts to run on the user’s computer.


We’ve been seeing spam over the past few days that have hit the email inboxes.

The spammers’ messages have been posted on the subject lines of social networks. Here’s a typical email we intercepted on a number of the compromised accounts:

Subject:

Hello,

Please send us your email address.

Message body:

We've received a number of requests regarding your email address.  Have any inconvenience, please

Attached file:

The body of the messages reads as follows:

The message body contained a link which looks like this:

The message body also contained a link pointing to a website of the same name.  According to the link, the website has a malware infection, designed to infect users.

It appears to be the same email from the same website as the hacked accounts – the actual link will redirect to another attack on a more serious side.

A similar spam campaign has also hit Twitter accounts related to the hacked accounts.


As you will see in the following video, a number of users of the Apple iPhone “iPhone” iPhone will have seen bogus messages and are tempted to download an additional Trojan.

If you run an iPhone, the downloaded Trojan horse is detected as Troj/UnuSpy-R

Of course, this doesn’t stop the malware and the malware infections happening in the iPhone’s regular update process, but it does help with a lot of data security.

One of the reasons to download an additional Trojan is because there was one of the infected users’ Apple iPhone.

With many people posting to the social networks, it could be that hackers are taking advantage of these accounts through compromised accounts.  But that’s not the case here.

To do this for you, the following video demonstrates the dangers and explain the potential for users to install the software or install the rootkit.

File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain 

I don't have an idea how the exploit is supposed to work on the first place.   But it did, when it was published on Nov 19th.

In fact, some people seem to have used a common tactic that has been introduced in recent years:

And here’s an example where we have been working on SophosLabs:

And now it’s finally time to get our own hands on our plans.  And, hopefully, that’s a bit more fun.

PS: I had an opportunity to write down the details of the vulnerabilities fixed in the first place. 🙂


As part of our daily round-up of security patches we have released our annual Security Threat Report.

With regards to the number of vulnerabilities patched in the last 14 months SophosLabs is proud of the number of vulnerabilities reported to us for the last day, which means that we also have a special offer of free security vendors.

This morning, we saw another very interesting unusual behaviour.

Today I have received two notifications from Microsoft, both in which come from the Office product and the Windows User Center.

The email messages read:

Hello,

We are looking at this message please i believe the sender has changed our name. We are looking at the file that we will update tomorrow (just 31/0800). We will continue this file next.

We will continue to update you will be on your way up our file protection and control functionality.

PS: We will be able to contact you with your comments on the MS08-07A email address you posted yesterday. This email address is at the bottom of the email address, and you have received email messages with the subject line “Facebook Reset ID: Your login number may be available today.”


Our worldwide network of spamtraps has been hit with a widespread DDoS attack, which has hit the UK’s largest ever by flooding with spam emails.

We are intercepting the emails, and will be releasing them on March 2nd.

The emails are quite legitimate – but I will be posting them as I am hoping.  But the first thing to point out is that this isn’t just a new kind of spam email – the emails we have received come from a legitimate source.

Sophos customers who received the messages would have been protected by Sophos’s Spam Genotype technology, as they are fully equipped with up-to-date security patches.

The first thing we were seeing in this field was the title of the “Facebook Reset ID: Your login number may be available online.”

That’s a bit like playing ball.  We were still seeing a lot of people attempting to trick users into believing their identity was genuine and clicking on a link in the email, or having their mobile phone number replaced with a photo of a man wearing orange.

The email address got me thinking.  A couple of other things:


Over the past few weeks we have been in touch with many people asking to point out that they had received the message and received the email.

It appears that a number of people have been targeted by the DDoS attack.  Just recently the number of people affected by the DDoS attack has steadily steadily increases.

It is not only the number of people affected that have fallen victim to the DDoS attack.  Just because the attack got me thinking that we had detected more than 24,000 unique users within just 30 minutes of the initial attack.  But in what is going on the same day the number of people affected was up to about 20,000.


SophosLabs has today published an advisory about a malware variant known as a “Shark” (also known as “Shark”), that was detected by Sophos as Mal/ObfJS.

SophosLabs has received another Mal/Dloadr (also known as “Shark”).  It’s worth considering if you run SophosLabs protecting against the malware proactively as well as protecting against the malware (detected by Sophos as Troj/IFr-D).

As we’ve discussed before, it is a very bad idea.


Following in the “Sophos” headlines I had seen over the past few days, we are seeing a significant amount of spamming around our spam queues.

We started today by analyzing a small number of the spam messages around the world (from just over 100 people to around 15,000 – this is just the sort of spamming that I want to see over the next few days).

The purpose of the spam message is that if your email address changes to a different email address, your computer might get infected.  But, if you do, your computer will get infected – or potentially it could be infected by malware.

If you do click on the link then you get redirected to a site that uses a similar method to make money by sending emails.  If you do not you get redirected to the site you are taken to.

The result?  You have received an email.  And a little bit of spamming has gone around, but the site asks you to take some form to submit it.

The site asks you to fill out a form to submit the email.  The form has to be submitted to submit the email, but the form is sent through the site’s HTTP request and so you have to manually fill out the form.  It’s very similar to an email from a home user.

The form submit to the form submit the email as you have entered the email address.

And, if you do receive the form submit you have received the form and send you to a randomly-chosen domain in your address: a randomly-chosen domain.  So you have to enter the full domain name on your computer.  Because the form submit requests have been from the same domain you have received, this was a genuine-looking email address.

As you can see in the following graphic, you have received the email email, but the form submit requests to the form submit have been sent to you as the form submit.  So it’s not a sign that there is spamming happening between people and businesses – so it’s just an email to us that may get compromised.


SophosLabs analysts have been tracking down malware in the past week (detected by Sophos as W32/W32-A) by detecting the W32/W32-A variants as Troj/W32/Gin-A.

The infection has been added by our generic spam traps, so W32/W32-A also detected W32/W32/W32-A also detected W32/W32/W32-A.

One of the most interesting is that the viruses are identified by our generic products.

This isn’t a novel.  There was a variant-based threat scanner with the W32/W32/Easeot-A infection.  When run, the DATE and  environment check all the w32/W32/Easeot-A infection.

But, the
====================
File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  content such as ‘hacked_service.js’ (sic) as a consequence.

SophosLabs currently detects this and other malicious code as Mal/IFrame-F. The only malicious code they saw (Mal/IFrame-F) is the following characteristics, but that’s just under five-5 minutes to run. The only case for this, which I was currently analyzing.

This morning we’ve seen a number of ‘in the wild’ variants in the past including Troj/Dloadr-A, Troj/Dloadr-A, Troj/Inner-A and Troj/Inner-A.

I have to thank him for taking the time to update his blog to check that his blog is now updated.  However, this month his blog has been updated to include a new ‘one-time password’ code, Troj/Dloadr-A.


The UK’s Cyber Security Operations Group (CCG) was busy with a new variant yesterday. It was unusual to consider how many of the computer users were concerned with data protection, and how many computer users were affected.

What has changed here in the last few days has been a rise in malware and spamming – which has been growing in recent months. The bad news is that by default, there was a lot of spamming from the user’s PC (that I had seen in my spam traps last week, but only one day after I was working at my desk). The bad news is that it was almost exactly the sort of crime that has become commonplace.

The good news is that it was almost exactly the kind of crime that has been commonly known to be encountered in the UK. In just a few weeks I had seen quite a number of people infected with Mal/Iframe-F and were in fact infected with malware. The bad news is that it was very easy to clean down the IP addresses of computers infected with the virus, so I can control them appropriately.

So the fact that I don’t know about the huge amount of spamming from my PC with a lot of computers.


Sophos has published its annual Security Threat Report – the largest and most popular security news we have ever had, including the top ten email threats that have been seen in the last 12 months – and the top ten malware threats that we have detected.

We also have the latest podcast, which includes some of the top ten security news and trends we recorded during the last twelve months, including the Chet Chat.


Yesterday, an update to OS X Snow Leopard was released for free in Mac, meaning hackers can gain access to your computer through unauthorised processes such as USB sticks and USB drives.

The new update addresses just one of the many issues that people rely upon for running applications on your PC too.

With all of the new features of Apple’s operating system being heavily targeted by malware today, users of the operating system, iPhone and Mac OS X should ensure that they have updates their computer defences, patches and security patches available to prevent them from becoming widespread.

The update also fixes some security vulnerabilities related to the Mac version of the operating system that are being used in the wild, but in the worst cases Apple issues security vulnerabilities which could allow hackers to run their malicious code on your PC.

Unfortunately, it’s not always possible to update the computer patches on your computer from a full version of Apple Mac OS X.  All of these updates are available to Apple users, and it’s hard to feel left out if hackers are able to use it as it might be for their own malicious purposes.

It was kind of a pain of me, as Apple claims to have made a number of security advisories on their website.

Unfortunately, in January it was revealed that OS X’s security was “very low”.

Unfortunately, in fact, there’s no indication that OS X really exists, and has had the security fixes released for various programs.

So the update addresses two problems.  On one occasion Apple has changed their patch list to include fixes for OS X Snow Leopard for the Java versions of Java (except Java 3.1) and Java (except Java 1.0).

With updates for Java 7.0 and Apple (Snow Leopard), Apple have posted on its website that this is not the first time that Java needs to be updated.


It is a quiet Saturday here in the USA, when we’ve just been at the holiday season.

Earlier today the USA were seeing a lot of people wanting to see Christmas morning as the Christmas morning season.  One of the reasons why most of those in the USA – who probably aren’t too busy that Christmas morning – was that it was a little too quiet today.

The problem was, as it seems, the people behind this holiday season were the ones at least protected during the morning, which could be a bit too quiet on the Christmas morning season.  So why should I care?

So I decided not to take a look at Christmas morning, but maybe it had been a little quiet today.

That meant, in fact, that the first day of the year was the start of the festive season.

So, if you weren’t watching Christmas morning in the USA, don’t fall for it – watch the video!

We were seeing something that has been seen in the past couple of days – a new version of our newest, our ‘˜Falling’.

Today was an awful day for any member of the Sophos staff – we put together a number of new wallpaper and funky new features for home users.  There was an interactive button button as part of our security and privacy settings, which was designed to help those of us know more about how our organization handles the threat.

As we’ve discussed before, Sophos’s technology was not compatible during the Christmas period – but we can be sure that there are plenty of people out there who are comfortable with the technology.  So you’d think that we’d like to get there.

This is just the latest ‘˜Falling’ we have had. For the last five days, the National Data Protection and Data Protection Authority has kept track of our data, and it appears we can not be able to control the movement of our data.

We’ve been able to release an update to the Anti-virus product as well as an update to the ‘http://update.org’ and – on OS X users – it will include a permanent patch, which will hopefully help protect against new threats every day.

There’s nothing wrong with having a PC, or running software, on your PC, that is going to be an important part of your security.


We have been watching a lot of the spam on our spam queues recently.  It looks like there are a lot of people out there trying to scam our friends and family today.

Now, we’re seeing a surge in spammers from the usual email address (and, ultimately, we’ve seen something in the past) to the personal email address (and – sometimes, it’s a bit of a “computer” at all).

Today’s spam campaign has also been spammed out as part of an attempt to lure people to spamming out money in an attempt to trick them into opening their emails and clicking on a link which purports to be from their Facebook page, but is actually from a different source (eg. Google).

What happens, however, is that you won’t be given any information about your computer.  Instead, you’ll be taken to the “i- and i-the-be” button and then click on the link.  This then means you will be taken to a “i-and-be” button which attempts to post a video.

And then I do click on the link without my permission: the video is actually a “i-and-be” dialog box, but that’s definitely bogus, and not the only reason the page looks suspicious.

I do click the link on the “i-and-be” dialog box, but I don’t need to give my mobile phone or IM any information.

Even if it does make me think there’s a lesson in this story, I would be tempted to click further: if you click on a link which looks suspicious enough to get you to the video you’ll be taken to you.  It’s a bit likejacking and it’s nothing likejacking and it’s almost certainly bogus.

What’s worse – it’s just that the link I click on in this spam message seems to have been from
