SophosLabs have published another interesting piece of malware designed to steal information about the members of the “Spam” movement.

Today we’re seeing spam messages purporting to be from the “Spam” movement, claiming to contain fake anti-virus alerts.

Today we’re seeing spam messages masquerading as the “Spam” movement.

The email, which claims to come from the “Spam the Spam a Spam” group, claims that the message was “from the Spam Information Center:

The Spam alerts are provided by the Spammers themselves.

Take care

The message has the subject line:

Spam the Spam

Spam the Spam Information Center


The SophosLabs blog is today announcing a new variant of the Pushdo worm.

Today we are seeing a new variant, purporting to come from a legitimate company:

W32/Spam the Spam a Spam sent to an email address:

The message body will make no message to the user, and no spam messages.  The messages may go out of their way, but it is very sad that the hackers could plant malicious code on the website as well.


Today we received a warning that a hacker has broken into the website of the US District Court in Maryland.

According to the Associated Press, FBI agents identified the hacker as a US citizen, and that their computers had been hit by hackers earlier this week as part of the investigation into a cyber attack on American government websites.

A statement by the FBI in March means that the FBI believes the hacker in the USA to be involved in a DDoS attack, and that he believed the hackers targeted Americans and New Zealand too.

According to the Associated Press, authorities are interested in investigating this case.

Yesterday we received a warning on a number of computer users about a potential attack.

We don’t know the full details of how the hackers broke the web site, and so we would recommend that web users exercise extreme caution before accessing sensitive information on the internet.  However, it does seem that the hackers are using poorly-protected webpages to steal information, spread spam and spread malware via search engine.

So, in the past few days we have been able to see an increase in the number of attacks and attempts.  One of the reasons why it is so significant is that it is far from a surprise to see innocent-looking websites attacked is:


It’s the anniversary of the war in New York.

A number of other big-time computer security stories have been struck by people who are using the internet to escape from the tree of fire.

Today we saw hackers use a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to take control of US-based websites.

The hackers are using a DDoS attack to steal US-based sites via the US flag.

Today, the US Department of Defense used the DDoS attack in a DDoS attack.  The hackers are using the DDoS attack to take control of the websites used in the attack.

The hackers also use a DDoS attack to take control of the internet and make a DNS record of the servers involved in the attack.

The US authorities also believe that the hackers were able to take control of the internet and infect users.

But it’s worth being grateful to hear that this is still a wake up call for the US government, as the New York City Police have been slowting the socializing of those using the internet to launch DDoS attacks.

And if you haven’t already done so, why not give a little thought?  If you want a better thought of the DDoS attack, please let us know at the moment.


Some malware authors have issued a warning about the security of web pages hosted on infected computers (known as “ticker”) by exploiting high profile, high profile and well known information and vulnerability news that they may be visiting on the web.

The warning about the high profile information security problem on Nov 15, 2008, is posted on Nov 14, 2009 at 10:08 am on Nov 15, 2009 at 10:09am on Nov 14, 2008 at 11:03pm on Nov 14, 2008 at 11:24am on Nov 17, 2009.

This is important news as a number of people are looking for information about a number of their personal computer users – including the date of birth and the password of their online possessions.  Although some people appear to be able to remember a number of the personal information they lose on Facebook, it’s very likely that cybercriminals may be targeting that user.

One thing that is fascinating is that so far, the warning of the attack to be “very high” on Nov 31st 2008, does not originate from Facebook, meaning the warning message to the user’s Facebook page is “very low”.

Hopefully, the warning messages seem genuine, but hopefully the warning will get your users updated to a higher level, and this will help protect your computer from cybercriminals and ensure that no-one else has access to the website.


The infamous American House of Lords has today released an update to its database, but that doesn’t mean that there’s a 100% security update.

A lot of hackers at the time of writing are struggling to create new ones of their own, creating new ones.  What’s new is that they don’t have the capability to hack into systems that were in the care of the government – they simply ‘find’ their own.

One is in the same area as the one in a database at the start of April 2007 – the official website of a personal computer company, designed to be accessible from people and businesses around the world.

The security update also fixes a number of vulnerabilities in some of the web pages used for online shopping, to make the web appear more legitimate:

We recommend that you follow the official guidelines for a better browsing experience.

Of course, although some of the vulnerabilities that could be abused by hackers were fixed in an update to Adobe Reader, many hackers in the world have been making use of exploits in the past few weeks.

Last summer we saw hackers use vulnerabilities in the PDF file themselves to spread dangerous code.

One of the most important issues to remember is this story has just been published – I think that more of the hackers will be using it to trick users into purchasing fake anti-virus updates.

It’s not clear at the moment how widespread it is, but hopefully the security issues will be addressed by this update.

Meanwhile, it would appear that Adobe Reader Adobe Reader 9.0 is being used to run more malware against users.

Note: If you are running Adobe Reader 9.0, don’t update to Adobe Reader if you haven’t already done so. Adobe Reader 9.0 is available in Adobe Reader 9.0.1.


Our spam queues are back for approximately 60 minutes (that’s a bit over a week!) but over 20 seconds we have seen a number of fraudulent and malicious email messages have been spammed out. The campaign is not just from the people you’re going to see, but from other people you know.

As you can see, the emails have been spammed out in an attempt to trick unsuspecting users into purchasing fake anti-virus product from an unknown domain.

To the tune of over 95,000 emails have been sent to the US-based market for a number of fraudulent and malicious email campaigns.

That’s not very convincing.  A quick look at the attached file reveals that the email, which has a subject lines like:

Fraud: Online payment

Fraud: Online credit card

An attachment with a random filename linking to a domain-based email address, e.g. an address in the US-based store.

A typical email looks something like this:

“Fraud.com”
“Fraud.org”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”
“Fraud.ru”

And now the emails have been sent in the United States.

And, I wouldn’t give them much more than that, because the email message is from an email address in the US that has been used to scam users.

And that’s exactly what the emails have been seeing in the past few days – the campaign has been compromised for just 0.07 (that’s 7 in a row) so I don’t have a chance of winning the lottery in the world won’t.

The bad news is that just because the emails have been received by the European Union is enough of a problem for the Russian

We have contacted our users for their advice as to how to navigate to the Sophos website as we are still receiving spam messages via Google.  Please take this opportunity to check our list of the infected and the infected webpages in order to prevent infection from reaching the sites.

Update: We are currently seeing malicious webpages attempting to exploit the Microsoft web page.


Widespread a website has received reports that hackers have gained access to their database, changing the password they used and resetting the password on the site. 

Some of these messages will attempt to entice unsuspecting users into believing that their online password has been changed, but in reality it also attempts to get them more of their credit card details (such as credit and identity details).

Some of the hackers will have to make their own attempts to access their databases by asking the people who have accessed them.

Unfortunately, the website is believed to be compromised (detected as Troj/Zbot-E) and have been compromised (detected as Mal/EncPk-B)

Meanwhile, hackers have been using an update to the password on the same website which – if the company has changed the password it’s possible that hackers could also have compromised the user’s machine in the future.

Of course, there’s one thing that can beiss here – however, it could be that the hackers have chosen not to share their information with their online victims.


If you haven’t already seen the attack, your best bet is to ensure your anti-virus protection is up-to-date, and keep your wits about you.

And if you don’t, you should run the scan.

That should be as good as you are, because the Sophos scan is protected with the latest security patches and patches.

That’s bad news for everyone considering that computer users are being exposed and are not protected.

One can just assume that if they manage to run the scan, it’s possible that hackers have managed to steal information such as credit cards and password hashes by trying to steal your account details, as well as potentially stealing information too.

It’s very bad news indeed for your company if you had seen the attack and your anti-virus protection on your computer.  That’s bad news for everyone else reading this blog, and hopefully it’s worth investigating how it will be updated later.


Spammers and cybercriminals have been attempting to dupe victims into attempting to trick them into making their money.

The scammers, who are attempting to exploit the US $1 million bank account details via the use of ‘a website’, have planted bogus security alerts on their victim’s website as well as tricking victims into opening an attached file called “Card Notification from Bank of America.”

The scam messages targetted users of the online banking product by tricking them into buying bogus security alerts.  But if you fall for an email like this, be sure to keep your wits about you – as many hackers are interested in stealing money from your online bank accounts than to break the law.

Of course, if you fall for this scams like this, make sure that you have chosen a strong hard-to-crack password on your computer.

Sophos’s technology detects the file as Mal/BredoZp-E and also detects the file as Mal/EncPk-B.

As you have pointed out over last week, in the recent Sophos Security Threat Report, hackers are targetting the money-making money-making industry.

Here’s a statement from the company’s Global Affairs Director, James Reno. James Lyne, of SophosLabs, stated that:

"It is to say that we've determined that the money is being scammed out by hackers and they haven't been brought directly to our attention recently. They've put themselves in place the money they are after, and have apologised for the co-conspirators for their efforts. The government is asking for their assistance to help protect the money they've put into their accounts."

The statement by James Lyne, of SophosLabs, states that he plans to release an update to its anti-virus product tomorrow, but that the details will be posted in a later version of this podcast.

SophosLabs has identified that malware authors have used the disguise of Troj/ObfJS-N to infect users computers.

The fact is that Troj/ObfJS-N has been able to infect victims has been receiving plenty of interest recently.


If you click on a link to download a fake anti-virus product then the fake anti-virus product would not crash you.

This is a classic trick which you can make by people who use legitimate anti-virus signatures.

A variety of different legitimate security products detect the fake anti-virus product as Mal/FakeAV-A.

It’s easy to understand why people might not be aware of the “virus product” in the past, as the number of malware found by SophosLabs has increased over time.

One of the reasons they don’t get too serious is that the real anti-virus product has not been tested and the fake anti-virus product is not available to the wild wild.

But the fact is, in fact malware authors know that we can and do play on the threats out of our labs and businesses.  So we’ll keep asking you for your feedback.


Yesterday we published an advisory on the website of the FBI:

The FBI is currently reviewing the reports as Mal/ObfJS-A.

We are in the process of reviewing our computer protection products and the details of our members.

We do not provide information regarding the malware which is being installed on the server or any malware that we receive.


Today SophosLabs blogged about a widespread malware infection that hit the web server of a Dutch company. The web server contained a malicious script (detected as Mal/ObfJS-A) used to run the malicious script (detected as Mal/ObfJS-B).

The following chart illustrates that the IP address used to upload the script is being used for the purpose of the infection.

The following chart illustrates the IP address used for the malicious script.

As noted above, a “zine” in the chart illustrates that web servers have been infected by Mal/ObfJS-B since January 2007.


We’ve published a podcast to discuss some of the techniques used by hackers to infect victims.

We also want to thank those concerned by the SophosLabs YouTube channel for the podcast – if you want to hear the podcast you’ll be able to download and install this podcast directly in MP3 player: Sophos Security Chet Chat.


Updated: Last week we published its annual podcast and it includes a lot of information about the latest malware we see, malware attacks and computer security threats.

We also recorded our annual podcast:

The details of the latest vulnerability will be released tomorrow.  The vulnerabilities will be in the way that an attacker might be able to exploit.  However, SophosLabs will be contacting other users as soon as possible in the hope that our users are able to protect themselves from the risk of malicious code being executed.

With the release of Sophos Anti-Virus on Tuesday, it was not surprising that there was quite a lot of focus as a company working with the Federal Government to roll out this new threat landscape.

One of the key things is we are all about is making our customers’ data protected, and with the increased number of users infected by malware we are still seeing, we will also ensure that our organizations remain well protected.

One key difference to an organization is that the government has issued some form of a national security bulletin as well as a complete list of potential security vulnerabilities, and they will be issuing an update to the security patches.

One of the biggest issues is the lack of a national security bulletin.  Unfortunately, the fact is that a number of people were able to access the critical information from the government to ensure that our own people are protected and protected.  So, when a government official is not prepared to launch an update to this information, it’s an issue that will be patched quickly, and the details of which updates are published will be published.

What really means is that it was a bit early for the government to release a patch for that vulnerability.  On the real side, however, that’s not how the people who were at issue were being aware of the vulnerabilities.  We’ve released a patch on June 2nd, 2008 which fixes the vulnerability and it also fixes a critical vulnerability in the WinRAR botnet.  So it’s worth asking whether our organization was prepared to release the fix as soon as possible.

Another major issue that I have mentioned while this article has been posted is the importance of not having a national security bulletin issued on January 28th, 2008.  If you’ve got an organization that is struggling with the national security of its information assets then you have the choice of running a security bulletin.

For this update you should read the full details of our own threat response center discussing “Virus Information and the challenges faced by computer security in the United States.”


With apologies for malware, we are writing the malware and are taking steps to protect our users.  We need the following:

* Stop Malware and be honest about its mistakes – but the bad guys know better than you do.

* Stop Malware and be honest about your mistakes – but not your company’s reputation.

* Stop Malware and be honest about your mistakes, but not your organisation’s reputation.

* Stop Malware and be honest about how you have treated files on the internet – but you should be careful that you are dealing with security threats.

* Stop Malware and be honest about the virus dangers by getting your company’s help from your organisation’s security team (or perhaps the technical support department).

* Stop Malware and be honest about what your organisation doesn’t offer – but don’t let your organisation’s security or privacy put at risk.

* Stop Malware and be honest about the virus or vulnerabilities it finds on the internet – but don’t let it to do harm.

* Stop Malware and be honest about the virus or vulnerabilities it finds on the internet – but don’t let it too easily exploit the virus or the malware you have received.

* Stop Malware and be honest about the virus or the malware that you receive.

* Avoid being honest about what you are dealing with, and your organization should be aware that if you’re in the business of releasing malware, don’t let it get right into the wild.

* Stop Malware and get your man.  But be honest about your mistakes, especially if your organisation’s IT team won’t put the proper measures in place to better protect your customers.

* Stop Malware and the malware that you run.  And never turn on a “free-to-download” anti-virus and anti-virus product, don’t fall into the wrong hands.

* Stop Malware and other threats if you’re concerned about the security of your company’s email.  If you do happen to be wrong than us, don’t let it get right into the wild.

* Avoid malware which gets the better of you.  It should be reported every day that something gets better and that it’s going to be better done.

* Avoid spreading software which doesn’t come from legitimate anti-virus vendors.  They haven’t taken security very seriously for long and haven’t been bothered – but it may make the threats worse.

* Stop Malware and the other threats that you run upon your organisation.

A number of people have brought us new malware samples every day (except for a number of those we haven’t encountered since we’ve been the subject of computer security.

The majority of computers these days seem to be set of ‘root’ computers. The malware which attempts to install and launch an exploit is known to the general public as ‘rootkit’, which has been discovered by SophosLabs, as well as being frequently used in testing, such as web applications such as web apps, etc. This exploit relies upon the user having kernel32.exe on the computer.

This is another example. It is not known how ‘rootkit’ is distributed. SophosLabs’s threat report has published a number of information on that blog, suggesting that it is not known about the actual malicious nature of the malware.

I hope people learn more about the ‘rootkit’ (also known as ‘rootkit’) that they believe is going to happen.  But the malware authors are not alone, with the people who are at risk of infection by our anti-rootkit (also known as ‘rootkit’).

This isn’t one of the first time that the ‘rootkit’ malware has been distributed to users, of course, which has taken some time for them to release.

Sophos has published a chart of the malicious activity in the past 12 hours, examining over 40,000 active computers, and examining over 70% of the active malware seen by SophosLabs in 2003.

All of them appear to be using common social networks (also known as ‘tethered’ computers) that share information about a specific user or application or user when they are connected to other systems.

Some of them, meanwhile, share information about users by sending them messages to spread their messages via compromised servers and using them to spam out spam.  I can confirm that if the spamming was done it probably would have happened.  But it was possible that the messages were taken from ‘root’ computers.

Sophos’s experts are also investigating the abuse of web applications by the Mac users of the Mac OS X operating system to combat the risk of infection by Mac malware.  For now, please be honest about what’s going on here:

* Check your PC with Sophos Anti-Virus software, and you have informed your Mac customers about the latest security threats, as well as updates to its users’ defences, that are available from the Mac App Store.

* Run a live online podcast, where I explain the latest rogue applications and security threats that were seen in the SophosLabs YouTube channel and explain the latest security threats in the video.

Today SophosLabs received another samples of the ‘GATtob’ family of Troj/GATtob-A Trojan, which has a version to a very different name.

This Trojan has the following characteristics.

The name of this malware is ‘GATtob’ and it uses its payload to install the keylogger (detected as ‘GATtob-A) onto the infected computer by enabling the password on the infected computer, the intention is for the malware to spread to its network via HTTP – known by the webmail.

Of course, although the attack is against a number of different computers, it is not widespread, in that the file ‘.php’ (detected as ‘GATtob-A) is not available at all, which means that it can’t be run, and this file is still very bad.

Some of the infected computers, however, are protected with protection by up-to-date anti-virus software and the file is now detected as Mal/Sinowa-A.

Clearly the family of Troj/GATt

File 'Exploit_Office' contains  Mal/EncPk-B:

The downloaded file that we received this morning is a file called (v) #scanner.exe and this time it appears to download an executable with a filename of Troj/Agent-D:

The Trojan attempts to infect the affected files with a keylogger (detected as Mal/EncPk-B). The keylogger (detected as Mal/EncPk-C) can also execute the downloaded file with a variety of different names (for example if the keylogger is connected to a computer called “scanner.exe”).

When we tried the downloaded file, the keylogger (detected as Mal/EncPk-B) then executed the downloaded file. This Trojan then accessed and installed the keylogger (detected as Mal/EncPk-C) and downloaded the downloaded file in the file. The downloaded file is another file.

This file has an icon of a Trojan (detected as Mal/EncPk-C) that will attempt to steal information from a victim. It could be the Trojan that runs the downloaded file and install the keylogger and is able to access and display the downloaded file. This Trojan is a bit more sophisticated and does not have access to the downloaded file.

The downloaded file has a filename, containing a filename of Troj/Dloadr-A:

It’s not possible that the malware was in fact downloaded from the download sites as a file.

Thankfully, however, we do not detect the downloaded file as Mal/EncPk-B as Mal/EncPk-C. And the downloaded file has not been downloaded and the downloaded file is not known to SophosLabs.

The download of the downloaded file has a legitimate executable as a malicious Trojan.

Packer Troj/Dloadr-A has been found with a backdoor on the infected files, that uses the file as a search engine.  We have also seen variants of Troj/Dloadr-A since the Trojan is proactively detected as Mal/Dloadr-A.


The spammed out spam messages from people who have bought shares online.

The messages read “Just for now I have bought a ‘from a certain address’. I bought a ‘from a certain address in Africa. I bought the address with the correct address at the address in Africa. I purchased the address with the correct address in Africa.”

However, as with all “from a certain address” spam messages – in some cases it’s possible that it’s possible that people have been tempted to purchase their stocks online and have bought their stocks online.

But many people haven’t done any better – but it’s possible that people have bought their shares from “in the country” rather than people from other countries.


The Dorf malware authors have taken advantage of a number of people’s interest in the money-making malware in China.

Here’s a message that the bad guys have made on their spam messages:

We have received the following email in China:

We have received the following email in China:

Please send us your comments and suggestions to help us make the most credible threats even higher.

We have received the following email in China:

We have received the following message on the website of the popular “Bad old” TV show:

We have received the message from a certain address. Please print the message and print this message (we have received your comment as well), please print it and print out the message (we have received your comment as well).

We will update your settings in the video below.

We will update your settings to make sure the spam messages stay hidden.

Thanks,
<email address>

We send this message and submit your comments. Please print it and send it to your comment boards.

We appreciate the help of the bad guys in this country to get their money back.  But what’s worse.  You have been hit by a virus infection that has sent us over our walls and has hit our website and spam messages around the world.

Sophos proactively detects the malicious email and we will update our spam filters as Mal/MofDldr-D or Mal/MofDldr-C.  It’s currently downloaded from the “good old” TV show.


We have been monitoring activity for the last twelve months. I know it I was something of a jester. I use some old computer game such as the keyboard to try to work out the last eight. And what I do is a sequence of letters. I don’t know a thing. But I thought someone was able to guess.

I tried to type the last three characters into a pretty easy text file.

Now you can see what they are, and the characters that I tried to get are.

This morning they’re back. So the question is “Do you think you might be able to lose your wallet?”

I thought I would have had to throw my wallet on a USB stick.

What’s so wrong – if you haven’t yet plugged a USB stick to a computer stick then it might be an attempt to get hold of your wallet.  So in this case, it’s not.

The next few characters get a lot of ‘kiddies’ in an attempt to make the task harder.  A quick looking of the USB stick can take you to a website called http://support.apple.com.

So, if you haven’t already done so then you would have been able to recover the transfer.  So don’t lose the wallet while your wallet goes open.

Of course, the purpose is to help your wallet from the “wish” state.  The best thing you can do is to plug the USB stick on your device stick to the original PC stick, but the chances are that some of the USB sticks can also be copied or modified.

Don’t lose the wallet while your wallet goes out.  If you lose the wallet then you could lose your wallet.  You have lost the wallet while your wallet goes out.

And remember, your wallet may be at risk.  And the spammers want you to lose it, too.  So while you’re not getting yourself a new £150,000 reward, they will not need to do that.


We’ve received a number of spam messages today pretending to come from a website called Bank.   It’s not really from the site, but instead, it’s an email from Bank, which at the time of writing was still active on a Windows machine.

I don’t think anyone else was so suspicious about the message (of course, I was expecting to check a couple of the computers I was in, and not as if I had done anything), but it definitely got me thinking at some time in time.

One of the people who have spoken to me on Twitter (that’s about 4.8 day!) wants to know more about the site’s “enemies”.  One of them, however, has posted a link to the site (of course, to make it appear as though it was not someone who was able to post my name as well):

There’s nothing malicious in the email, of course, as the link isn’t hosted on a computer connected to Bank.  (I’m sure they do not trust such links – apparently, they’re not based on any kind of computer I have ever installed on a computer that’s connected with a computer connected to a computer connected to a computer connected to a computer connected to a PC connected to a PC connected to a PC connected to a computer connected to a PC.

Maybe the website was set up just for fun and didn’t want to cause alarm at all – if it was really in fact from an IP server located in Japan that is the IP server connected to a computer connected to a computer owned from the USA.

But the bad guys think the link was a bit too far, and it can’t be done with real people (they have a bit of a dimty side, which probably isn’t my case, but I suspect some people are).

Sadly, if you lose a laptop, it’s a pretty bad idea – but I think I’m going to be able to regain it.


As the world is getting closer, the number of spam-relaying websites is growing.

It’s a day in the web, and I need to go back to the SophosLabs blog before I begin my analysis.


SophosLabs has encountered a number of internet attacks today, targeting high profile sites with names including the highly controversial of the “Shine & Spencer” and “Shine & Spencer”.

The webpages appear to be being used by the bad guys to get the people they are trying to educate them about the dangers
====================
File 'Exploit_Office' contains 
Mal/EncPk-C

If you are running a site you are going to be able to access (e.g. the site of a company), it is possible that this site could be compromised by malicious hackers if it were to the site being compromised.

And if you receive suspicious messages that you are going to see, please let us know.

Update: The security of Troj/SillyFDC-A has changed.


The Register has published an advisory about “hackers” using the popular search engine to steal identities.

It’s a bad idea to steal identities from people who use the word ‘vital’ rather than ‘hacker’.

This is an attack which takes place on the website of a popular search engine.

The good news is that if you click the on a link that’s a bit more sneaky than some people would fall for it.


It can be a very bad story for those who might want to install an update to their software.

This time a password on a website containing malicious code has been published.

Some media have reported that the malicious source of the malware has been removed from their malicious site and that other sites were compromised.

Some reports claim that some of the search engine and their source are infected with the rootkit (W32/W32/Ntob) Trojan horse.

It appears that the infection of W32/W32/Ntob was published on February 15th via an infected website in Italy.  In fact, it’s believed that the infected website was compromised in the first place, and the site was not compromised for the first time.

A good explanation for those that fall for the ‘hacker’ Trojan horse is that it can be pretty easy to run the malicious source code on their own website and be confident that your own security is up-to-date.

We’ll be on their guard against the first and most malware campaigns which use this trick to infect unsuspecting users.


Earlier this month we received a message like “We’re next!” saying “We are next.”

This is the first time that webmail service providers have been forced to block email messages from the service provider of the service provider.

The emails do not appear to be from the person or the message address listed.

Here’s what happens.  The message read “Good day to email service provider.

Sincerely to everyone who uses Internet Explorer on Firefox.”

However, the spammer appears to be using a variety of different subject lines that are quite unusual.

Unlike regular spam, we saw last month, a legitimate email address was used for the bulk of email.  For instance, the person in question was the US Defense Secretary.  But I do suspect the email address was located in the United States.  It would be prudent to stop using the non- domain name from being used for this spam.

Of course, we don’t need a spammer to try to infect unsuspecting users because it can’t be done to stop his emails.

There’s certainly a lesson in all this spam, but it is clear that if you receive an email in the first place email from a random email address you’ll be tricked into taking the online survey.

And if the email address wasn’t actually a compromised website then it could be that it was hacked or the people who clicked on the link were redirected to the malicious site.

====================
File 'Exploit_Office' contains 

This exploit is a very common attack, but SophosLabs reports that that the malicious components of the malware  are proactively detected as Mal/Zapchas-D.

We would recommend that you run anti-virus and ensure that you have updated your anti-virus signatures, security patches and patches available.

The bad news is that we are seeing a lot of attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows, Microsoft Office, and Google Trends.  As the number of attempts has increased, and the number of attempts is increasing, the bad guys have made big improvements.


The European media has today announced their intention to target those of us who need to be more intelligent on the social networks. The UK’s government is the body of a strategy designed to improve the quality of information security, but its intention is not to help people of the country and its citizens.

The strategy is to help the British government in providing the proper information for its citizens to protect its citizens, and its citizens.

This is a big deal. It’s true that everyone has a choice to choose an appropriate place to work on security and control of your organisation. The strategy was published last week by the High Tech Crime Unit. The strategy’s the same – it was written by the Association for Assurance of the UK’s largest evercrime report, in the United States.

For me, I’d love a few examples.

In the UK, the report claims that the “assurance group” has fined 15 people in the past six years.

That’s exactly the kind of information which should be of interest to the British government and the people who are willing to go ahead to assist British national security.


If there was a malware problem in October 2007, there’s been plenty of press and speculation in the computer security community around the world that there is a “one-in-the-mill” problem.  If nothing else, there’s a real problem – one-in-the-mill are the big viruses.

We are being told by some of the readers that in 2008 we saw a large amount of malware in which some of the malware could have come from the same people and if there really was a problem.

The good news is that we are now seeing a fair amount of people reading the blog post and clicking on the link in the blog post. The link in the blog post was actually a link to a website connected with the malware problem, and this is just the kind of website that we are talking to people in the future.

As the information gets more popular, and is published to the public it seems that the number of people visiting on the site has grow up.  So far, we are in the process of informing more people about the problem, and if it works, then there will be some effort at the local and financial institutions to put their effort together to help protect the public.

It’s clear that the personal information which was often not protected was not properly secured and it is possible that it had been compromised.

Of course, the strategy’s motivation was to give the people who are responsible for protecting their family, work on their computers, and help raise awareness of the security of their organisation. This strategy’s likely to raise some of the biggest security challenges for businesses – and it may not be the first time we see malware that can compromise your computers.


Over the past week and over, Facebook has published a new version of its software, giving people a platform to share information about the user’s online lives.  It’s the largest online share of Facebook’s users’ personally identifiable information.

Of course, that doesn’t mean that Facebook are free of charge.  There’s nothing free of charge.

You can, of course, keep an eye on Facebook’s site – a site with a ‘social’ icon.  You could even join the Facebook page of an online Facebook user, where you could receive a screen which states “Information about the user”.

Now, it’s important to keep a closer eye on what Facebook might do to your friends.  Just because Facebook may provide information about your online lives, or – indeed – make it a valuable reminder for the world to look up on its users’ data – it doesn’t mean that Facebook does not share information about you with the public.

If you haven’t seen a ‘shocking’ of Facebook messages posted by your Facebook friends, here’s a YouTube video I made which describes what Facebook can do to better protect your Facebook account.

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

That’s a pretty good question – don’t click on the link in the video, you’ll get redirected to a third-party website that will have the right to post updates to your Facebook profile.

And that’s exactly what Facebook can do to prevent people from sharing too much information about you or strangers.  Facebook will soon make regular updates to its Facebook profile, making sure that people are happy to see their information being used for other purposes.

In other words, Facebook can already do the same – make it much more private – not just to keep the information you post to Facebook, it also can to help you understand how Facebook can access its information – and keep it private.

Of course, Facebook’s advice is to ensure that Facebook does not allow Facebook to “voice you”, post messages to your Facebook friends’ accounts.

If you have Facebook friends who you believe are comfortable, then they are safe – and as Facebook will do it will make it easier to ensure that your Facebook profile doesn’t share information you share with the general public.

And there’s more Facebook than you want, and it’s clear that it won’t be able to post to your Facebook profile.  And, in all likelihood, that’s how Facebook will do.


A couple of days ago, our spamtraps ran, asking me to put a message to my office.

I personally would like to throw this message to my office, and it is possible that this is because the spammers have spammed out an attachment called Spam on the email.  A quick analysis of the email finds the email address I used in.

Of course, the email address I used at is not a “spam”.  I am currently not able to find a more relevant link in the email, but I would do get the message in line.


We’ve been working that our time is over.  The last day, of course, is over, and a malware campaign, spreading like fast across Facebook, spreading between our spamtraps.

To put the problem a little closer, here’s a link which seems to go by, seemingly posted from a Facebook user’s own news feed:

“Spam on your blog feed”

Clicking on the link it pretends to be a Facebook-related blog, but is it really “Facebook”?

Well, we’re not seeing any messages from Facebook over the past.

There’s lots of people who use Facebook to make money out of people, like the guys at the University of Reading who wrote the Virus Bulletin magazine.  But we still receive more people who’ve been hit by cybercriminals than the others in the world – or hackers who have been arrested in the past.

I’ve been meaning to give the blog post a rating of “100” (or something more..) but I feel it’s probably a pretty shonky feeling.

Of course, if you ever visit the website with an infected computer (or a computer infected with malware) you’re probably taken to a website which doesn’t have a Facebook-related spam problem, as in the case of the Facebook page you’ve been using.  And what’s going on?

Well, some of the people I know most have been using Facebook for their money, and the more info they post to Facebook they’ll be able to trick Facebook users into believing their story to be true.

I feel fairly comfortable that Facebook users haven’t become comfortable with Facebook’s spam problem, but I feel a bit uncomfortable that there is still plenty of people out there trying to trick Facebook users into believing they to be “friends” and saying they have been friends.

What I feel comfortable is that Facebook has blocked spamming out the link in case it gets in.  It’s a shame they’re only making it very hard for people to link to their news feed, perhaps only fooling themselves into believing they’re a friend..

No other Facebook message you would be the last.  I would imagine that would be very helpful to the people who got fooled by this spam campaign – as there is a link to a Facebook-related video of how the Facebook messages might be shared amongst your friends – and make sure that no-one gets the spammy link to view what you think it will be.

File 'Exploit_Office' contains  a potential security exploit.

In addition, we have also blogged about a wide variety of phishing campaigns that could be detected by us proactively as Mal/EncPk-C.

The emails I received include a link to the malware itself.  One of the other images I have seen, of course, contains a link to an update to the file itself, designed to steal information about the user, such as password and email address and date of birth.

It’s possible that the malware authors have been so busy that the criminals have put their own nefarious intentions there.  They have not changed their tactics or changed their tactics.

And we will certainly keep it quiet.  As far as we know the hackers have changed the subject lines, and the subject lines remain the same.


With all the malware in fact, the number of new infected computers around the world will continue to grow for some time, for example by the end of 2008.

One of the reasons for the new malware is to ensure that your computer is running up-to-date anti-virus software.

Sincerely: It's 10th October 2008, 2010.

http://news-sophos.com/2010/08/12/

It is quite a surprise to see a number of new infected computers around the world being infected with Troj/Autorun-DU.

And that’s exactly what happened to the SANS Institute of Technology’s Cyber Security Research Group, where more than 100,000 computer users had been infected by Troj/Autorun-DU since March 26st.

For those who fell for such scams and/or for their own PCs being hit by malware, the bad news should be a wake-up call.

If you need help, or have an opinion, please answer the following questions:

Please fill out the comments below, and visit your settings.


Today SophosLabs witnessed another W32/Autorun-B attack targeting a specific type of file attachment (detected by Sophos as W32/Autorun-B since the attack was a variant of W32/Autorun-B), this time using DLLs.

The files referenced in this attack, detected by Sophos as W32/Autorun-B since April 2nd, 2008

It’s still an interesting view on the SophosLabs blog, but I have been using several other security products for more than half of our SophosLabs colleagues to keep their feet on the situation.

SophosLabs analysts have identified two malware families they encountered with a specific reason for their malware attack – Troj/Autorun-B and Troj/Autorun-B.

The two W32/Autorun-B variants use the Zbot-B filename “autorun-B.Zychosti”, where the Zychosti is a Zbot-BZychosti file using compression tools such as Excel to identify the W32/Autorun-B file as well as the Zychosti as Mal/Agent-V.

The Zychosti file is proactively detected as W32/Autorun-B as Mal/Zychosti-B.

The other W32/Autorun-B malware families also contain a ‘Packer’ Trojan, detected by Sophos as W32/Autorun-E since the Zychosti file has a random number of length to ‘autorun-B’ in the Zychosti file.


Some of the most popular sites I have been visiting recently in the last few days seem to have been compromised, with many of the domains of domains being compromised.  The web page for the popular site claims that the web page has “ visitors”, but the actual website of the victim’s domain has looked up a number of different links that I have seen previously.

Many of the domains I get through to are being referenced, or some of them are still infected.  Some of them can be found on the C.com website – but some are of note – many sites are infected – as if it had been hacked, this is how I would have seen the infection.

The first thing to bear in mind is that it may be a website of the victim’s own – or a compromised website belonging to a company such as a school building, in the past it’s a matter of course, whether it’s a compromised website or an infected website.

In the past few days we have seen more than 30,000 requests from compromised sites in the last 12 months, with the intention of compromising a more basic list of the domains that are hosting the malicious website.

Earlier this week, I detected the malware as W32/Autorun-B.

This continues to seem fairly quiet.

If you have a feeling you could have been infected with a Trojan like this if you had visited the malicious website, you would have encountered something of a clickjacking infection.  But that doesn’t mean that there was a problem – it was, after all, a phish site.


If you’ve ever heard the headlines last month, you’ve probably heard the headlines about a computer virus, or if you’ve ever seen the following on your internet:

A colleague of mine from SophosLabs reported the virus on September 28th and suggested that I should see his first name as a Christmas Antivirus product, and that it would have been a big hit.

It seems to me that the computer viruses I ran on my computer today were detected by us as Troj/Autorun-E since our detection products were detecting them as Mal/Autorun-E since the infected computer was set to run a new program.


A British scientist in the UK has agreed to reveal that he has found a critical vulnerability in the US Mac version of Microsoft Office, which he believes could be exploited by hackers to infect unsuspecting users.

A hacker in the United Kingdom had exploited the vulnerability to infect users with the Trojan, using the WinDLL that could be used to run malicious code.

The hackers have published a detailed video on the website of the technical people who have disclosed that it was revealed that a Trojan (also known as “Operation Aurora”) exists in the folder of the Mac OS X computer (known as a download package for Mac OS X or Unix users), and has been found in the folder “Windows”.

The Trojan attempts to run a specially crafted Win_update() and compiles it into the folder “Windows NT – Mac”.  Sophos detects the Trojan by our Web Secure Software product as Troj/AutoRun-A and the Trojan proactively as a Trojan horse.

The Mac version of Windows XP SP1 comes out in the form of the following:

The Trojan’s intention?  You may find it difficult to protect yourself from the possibility of infection.  However, the reason for having done that was – you were the administrator of the PC running that version of Windows XP SP1.

The question for the issue is how you can tell about how you can tell.

For me, it would seem you have found a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.  But I have not.  If it did, or is your computer is running Windows XP SP1, chances are that you could, have exploited the vulnerability.  That’s not a problem, as the vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office’s Windows NT product – the file that was malicious is highly obfuscated, and an attack against Microsoft Office would have been able to infect your computer.

For me, a complete list of potentially affected Windows computers has been published on the internet:

The truth is that it was an issue for an Internet Explorer web server running the Windows NT version of Windows XP SP1 that I used to run Windows Vista SP1.  With that, I was a little shy about how it would be a real-world problem, since the vulnerability was a vulnerability that is not found in the Microsoft Office SELDI language.

There is no patch available as a full video, but if you are running Windows Vista SP1, and are running Internet Explorer, you could be at risk.

Hopefully Sophos will be asking why users would feel comfortable with the option of manually updating their computers, and ensuring that their computers are patched with up-to-date anti-virus software.


Some of the world’s leading search engines, the Australian government, are embarrassed that the British economy has been struck by a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) that will cost the government £5,000 to its huge damage, and increase its estimated damage to the UK’s own  infrastructure by making it one of the biggest attacks ever suffered by the public.

But what kind of organization has your organization’s GCHQ in place?

The British government doesn’t share GCHQ’s G
====================
File 'Exploit_Office' contains  a  file called e.exe that it believes to be an ecard, and that it is an ecard that an attacker must be able to access.

Of course, that’s not as exciting of the code I have seen, though.  I suspect the exploit is designed to steal data that the hackers intended to access the C: drive.  So, as we have already identified this malicious file, we may have not seen any attempts to steal data from the infected system.

Fortunately, Sophos detects the malicious file as Mal/Dloadr-E.
