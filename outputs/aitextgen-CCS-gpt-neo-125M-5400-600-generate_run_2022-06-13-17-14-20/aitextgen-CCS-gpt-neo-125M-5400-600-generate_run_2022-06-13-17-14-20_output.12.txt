In my regular email this morning I’ve been receiving calls from “Facebook friend”, telling me that my computer had been sent to a friend’s new address.

I received emails from “Facebook friend” asking me questions about my password.

Hmm. I did get notifications from “Facebook friend” asking me for a password, but I do not get messages from the person’s friends.  If this message was sent to my friends I would be very nervous about what else I would do for them, and the answer would be ‘[I] had not received your password.”

I was contacted by my friend’s account immediately and asked him about the password on the phone.  According to the link he received was one of many things that could have been compromised, but I failed to make the password to him.  The answer?  Your password.

Well what did he do, but it really was a attempt to make me a little too much of a security risk.  Well, I tried to make the password something of a story, and it seemed like an attempt by hackers to spam me out.  My friend did receive the password for me before entering my password.  He has changed his password to something that I would have difficulty typing out the password.  This time he has changed my password and made the password guess something like a picture.  This guy has changed my password to something that I have changed with the password he has received.  A lot of people have changed the password of his friend’s account and tried to visit the password store from their friend’s own website.

The password store I used to set up the password, but it was easy.  So what else was it that I do to make my password better?  Would I not make it too difficult for the password store to do it?

Yes, I need a password store to be able to access my password, so that I never entered my password in any other way, but there was no such assurance I had taken the password.  But this isn’t what I have chosen from.

So, I went on a further look at the password store in the settings, and it’s what I do to prevent this.

Here is the password store for the password store.  I have changed the password password to something more secure than “password store”, but that really doesn’t mean that there was any need to set up a password store.

As part of my password store I now log into a new password store.  My password store allows me to log into password store and get your password store to my password store.  A good solution would be for me to use password vault to store password store.

A former colleague of mine has posted a message on his blog about “Sophos Anti-Virus”. His blog post posted on Nov 8th that he blogged about the topic.

Sophos has published the advisory on Nov 9th, and it seems that we have received a lot of attempts by people concerned about malware/spamware/spamware infections.

The first thing you need to know is the nature of the message – the ‘Sophos Anti-Virus product’. The first thing you see is the message which asks you to buy some Viagra (also known as a ‘decent’), and when the message claims that you have ‘ paid the fee (your account name, your passport, your passport, or some part of your job) it then attempts to download more malware and/or gain access to a website hosted in Russia. This is why you have paid the fee (your password, your passport and your job), and so you have paid the fee (your job, or the amount of money, and whether you have paid the fee), so you have paid the fee.

To that you don’t need to get your credit card details back (as it seems that he’s a bit lazy for a couple of people to have been in the past), he seems to agree that it is “very serious” that his Facebook account has been compromised:

“There is no denying that Facebook is not a traditional ‘Facebook’ website, but is more popular than ever before in the country of Russia.

If you have been hit by a spammer, don’t fall for a scam. You should never fall for a scam like this. Even if you’re a Facebook user, remember to be very careful that your online privacy is not compromised.


A hacker in the US has been arrested in connection with the Anonymous/Anonymous/Anonymous/iPad/tamies/mcr/mcr/kait/kait/sab/kait/pr/kait/gRKLKGJGK.

The US authorities claim that the hacker believed that “the US Army, US Secret Service, US Air Force, US Air Force, US Air Force, US Air Force, US Air Force, US Air Force, Department of Defense, US Air Force, US Air Force, Department of Defense and the Department of Defense were involved in the attack against the US Department of Defense.”

According to a statement by the loosely-knit US authorities, the hacker believed that “the FBI believed that the US Department of Defense (and other American authorities) believed that the US Army and US Air Force were involved in the attack against US Air Force and US Air Force in the attack against US Air Force and US Air Force in January of this year”.

Clearly the Anonymous/Anonymous/Anonymous/Anonymous/iPad/pr/Kait/iJGKGKJGKJGKGKJGKGJGKGKJGKGKGKUKGKFJGKIYUKGKNKWNV

A statement from the loosely-knit US authorities says that the hacker was concerned about the “Secux� and “Secux”, and that the FBI believes that the investigation is “completely and firmly”.

Meanwhile, the US authorities claim that the hacker’s computer system, which it believes includes a botnet, was infected with a Trojan (also known as Zeus) on December 2nd 2008.

It is alleged that Anonymous and their “anonymous” co-ordinates planted on infected computers for a number of different purposes.

Of course, Anonymous and the rest of the world’s media partners seem to be taking note that this attack is not just on “Anonymous”, it also has been used to “try and get a lot of trouble over the internet.”

There is no denying that Anonymous/Anonymous are responsible for it.  Indeed, in the past few months we have seen other attempts by hackers to exploit, either to spread dangerous code or to break into internet accounts.


When I joined SophosLabs last week the focus of a discussion on security in our Vancouver offices was on “key and control”.

I spent a lot of time with our UK team on the UK’s government – what we do is make sure that our teams have the security they need – and what they are able to do to make sure we are protected.

To help me understand the latest developments and implement what is going on in SophosLabs.


Last week I wrote a story about how the Mac OS X malware author created some new fake anti-virus product.

We started looking back at the details of some of the different malware samples I’ve analysed, but I don’t know what it was.

The first file I came across in Mac OS X was Troj/FakeAV-A.  Troj/FakeAV-A is a Trojan that installs itself into an application that downloads and saves the fake anti-virus product and it then launches it to run on a Windows computer.

While running the new freebie ‘Free Software’ Mac anti-virus product we detected something very similar – this time a new program (detected as OSX/FakeAV-A) and this time it was downloaded to an removable drive and dropped the OS X source code (detected as OSX/FakeAV-A) and so we took a closer look at this functionality.

When I started the downloaded file, it was the following (detected as OSX/FakeAV-A). When it hit, it ran a command prompt and then tried to download and run it. This is an example of the file downloading.exe and then download.exe (detected as OSX/FakeAV-A).

If I tried it on Windows, I was immediately suspicious of that downloaded software. It was possible that the file download.exe was the source of the downloaded malware and contained random file download.exe, and even more so, it was quite difficult.

When the file download.exe was downloaded, and I clicked on a particular file that was detected as OSX/FakeAV-A, it was detected as OSX/FakeAV-E.

As soon as I tried to download and run a program from the download screen I was immediately suspicious of such file download. The downloader didn’t include a file download.exe, and in fact it was downloading from a third party download folder, but in the case of OSX/FakeAV-A, it was not.

So what’s to say about this file download.  There’s nothing like as much of a shame in this particular case.

It’s possible that if you download or run the.rar program from the download screen, it will install a “get” version of Flash player program, and that one is a bit of pirated and malicious software.


If your company’s information security isn’t being properly properly held, but it can be better held off on a higher priority level as the company’s Information Security and Data Protection Act (ITPA) will come into effect.

The Information Technology and Data Protection Act, of course, allows companies to protect data from identity theft, but it does also mean that companies should be able to control if, what, and what data is used.

An organization should “insulate and maintain” information that is accessed, and that it is “encouraged by the staff and partners of the company (and everyone else in the world) and that it does not take the law very seriously.

With this in mind, it would appear that all of this would be at risk if the information you grab from is in an unencrypted state of trust.

The Act doesn’t apply to companies in your company – the law does apply to companies who do not have their customers’ information confidential.


Sophos has published an article today talking about what was a ‘leak�’ of attacks, which was

It will be interesting to see how a company can take more care of people around the world. One question for all of our users is this: why are we so concerned that we haven't yet learnt anything from the past? Is there a lesson in being sure your organization hasn't received an email from someone else?

Sophos has received a number of queries from its customers who would like to know more:

The UK’s Metropolitan Police, in the United States, has issued a warning which states: “This is a case study in London. The UK’s Metropolitan Police will not disclose the details of the case or that the affected individual or individual were the victims of the computer crime.”

It’s unclear to me whether there was a real issue there at the Metropolitan Police’s offices, or it seems to be an issue that should be treated carefully.

The British police are also making minor threats to its computers, and its operations, and if they do respond to them, there’s an explanation to believe the case and not delay its investigation.

Meanwhile, at the same time as we receive reports that we have received tens of thousands of pounds of pounds of pounds (such as a number of staff), there’s still to be a full investigation into the investigation.

We can confirm that the warning has been issued on October 14th, 2008, which means that users of the Police’s Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU) are affected as they wish.

We do not believe the alleged cybercriminals are interested in defacing our computers and we will keep our users informed if necessary.

We could certainly hope that the investigation will be successful if the Police Central e-Crime Unit sees fit. If this investigation follows, the Police will be interested in helping to protect its customers and their £-rated customer.

We will also be asking for some general information about the Police Central e-Crime Unit.


Earlier this week we saw a wave of mass-spam malware that I wrote about today, targeting government sites. The emails contained some of the subject lines “An invoice to the US Secret Service”, and tried to trick users into opening the attached file attachment to a Trojan horse.

In this latest spam email I saw the message body “An invoice to the US Secret Service” and an attachment called “An invoice to the US Secret Service.”

The attached file will not work, and the Trojan horse will be detected as Troj/Auntyspy-A. The file however contains a Trojan horse that can be used to infect victims with the Mal/EncPk-A Trojan horse.


A British police investigation into the Metropolitan Police’s investigation has determined that a gang, under the Computer Misuse Act, stole personal information relating to the Police in order to steal online evidence that the Police were not using any computer hacking group.

According to the Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU) it was determined that the information contained confidential information relating to a member of the “Police”, and was used to commit offences under the Computer Misuse Act.

Police in London, in London, arrested six men who allegedly used the stolen information, and five women who, according to the Daily Mail, used the information to steal the £10,000 stolen from the Police’s offices in London to assist in the offences.

According to The Daily Mail, Metropolitan Police Officers also found evidence that some of the victims had been in the London office between the ages of 23 and 22, and had accessed websites belonging to the Police, where the investigation found evidence that it had stolen £4,000 in January of 2010 from a suspected fraudster.

This was claimed by a newspaper newspaper:

"The Police Central e-Crime Unit has arrested three men in connection with the theft of data relating to the Police, and the Police Central e-Crime Unit and the London Police Central e-Crime Unit. The three men are said to have taken over the Police Central e-Crime Unit, in London, and arrested four men in connection with the theft.

Two of them, aged 23 and 21, are said to have engaged in illegal activities related to the theft of personal information relating to the Police.

Clearly, the Police Central e-Crime Unit has contacted police in many cases asking for personal information relating to members of the “Police”, including names, dates of birth and passport numbers.

The investigation has identified five individuals who have been arrested in connection with the hack.

According to the Daily Mail, the four men are said to have been connected to the “Anupgrade” (ACQ) and “Aupgrade” (ATQ) attacks in London.

The three men, aged 31-21, are said to have joined the Metropolitan Police’s “Anupgrade” operations.

One of them, who has been arrested in the UK, is said to have “liked a person” from the Metropolitan Police’s offices in London.

According to a statement posted on the Metropolitan Police’s website, the Metropolitan Police’s website says that the men’ names, phone numbers, and bank account details were stolen via a hack – dubbed “Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation ‘Operation’ on the computers used in the attacks.

Clearly, we are looking to improve our systems to ensure our systems are kept up-to-date. It would be very unfortunate for the criminals to do more to convince victims to change their security and privacy settings.


On Thursday, May 28th, 2008, SophosLabs received an email from someone else’s email address, and sent an attached Trojan horse.

A member of the victim’s family is also a member of the family (who have since registered to be an Apple Mac user), and is a member of the public (who have received a “.cc email address from the same company.”), in case the email address was not correct.

But on May 28th, 2008 it was not. The email address got attached to the message. But in the background it was an attached Trojan horse that the Trojan horse was after. And on May 28th, it was not!

The email address got attached to the message as well as the mail address. This is where the Trojan horse’s email address was given, and the recipient address was also spoofed. But in that case, the Trojan horse was the link. And if you were not expecting that, the Trojan horse now got attached to the email address.

So, by May 28th, the Trojan horse was not just a threat. It was a very bad idea at first, and we will continue to have a closer look at our adversaries’ plans and tricks that we have been seeing on our customers’ computer systems.

The Trojan horse has been removed from the internet, but this time it has been detected by our analysts as Mal/Dloadr-C.

The Trojan horse was spotted by our analysts on May 28th. It appears that the Trojan horse was designed to infect victims with a Trojan horse called Troj/Unif-P and it was not mentioned before, or until now, because the Trojan horse was not detected before.

But it looks as though the Trojan horse was just the kind of malware Trojan horse was the main threat, in its intention to steal the information they wanted to spy upon.


The death
====================

The site also contains a link, however the page was a compromised website containing a malicious script that was proactively detected as Mal/ObfJS-C. The script contained the file “Spam mail/spam.php” and contained the malicious JavaScript file:

The malicious script also contained two files (Troj/Dloadr-C and Troj/Dloadr-D) the files have been detected as Mal/Dloadr-D. The first file contained a malicious script detected as Mal/EncPk-C.

The second file contained the relevant files, W32/Spam-B and W32/Spam-B. The malicious script detected as Mal/Dloadr-C will point to the malicious site and its malicious DNS records. This is a bit of an overkill of some sites.

The bad news is that the DNS records of the hacked site are not necessarily associated with a malicious script. So if the sites was compromised, it would have been safe to clean up any malicious webpages using this method.


Following recent malware attacks against web-based services including the likes of the New York Times, the Internet Storm Center (ISC) and others, the website has been hit with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

Yesterday a high number of people were posting links to a malicious website and the website has been hit with the DDoS attack (this one was published in October 2008, and others are at risk).

According to a report in the Daily Mail newspaper, the attack was brought in response to the “redding” of “the servers” – something that could have been used by the hackers to steal the database of potential customers.

According to an advisory issued by the authorities, the website is believed to have been struck with the DDoS attack.

According to the BBC, the attack also targeted other websites.  The first one was a domain registered for a number of high-profile web sites, and the website was hit.  The other two were “Greetings the DDoS attack” and the “Anonymous attack”.

The DDoS attack struck up the website with “red disabling” and prevented it from being used by the hackers to direct traffic to the site.  These will have struck up the website’s DNS records for a number of months, and provided some level of protection for the authorities as to the investigation.

The first part of the attack was a site run by the hackers, which is believed to have hosted the “Anonymous attack”.  According to a statement issued by the website’s IT team, “The attack resulted in the DNS records of all the compromised sites in our database [there was] that the sites are being used for the attack, potentially through automated bots and over the last four months.”


It is a bad news if it can be that cybercriminals have planted a malicious file on your computer.

The first thing to say about the growing popularity of Mal/ObfJS-C is that it is becoming increasingly common for hackers to use DDoS attacks to infect websites.

A quick look at the following video, made by a Sophos technical engineer:

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

The second day of the attack is a little less dramatic, but perhaps more serious about the many people who fall victim to DDoS attacks.  The number of people affected is increasing by the number of infected computers.

As an example, the number of computers affected by the DDoS attack was up to 80,000.

This shows that cybercriminals are targeting the number of computers infected by Troj/DDoS – in the last 48 hours, a total of which it was 1.5 million.  So, if you think you can imagine how vast could it be, think again – the number of computers infected by Troj/DDoS is exactly 1.5 million – it might have dropped to around 8% of all.

What happens if you are hit by DDoS attacks (for the past 24 hours, or by the use of your computer for your online bank accounts), is to take the necessary steps to ensure that your computer has up-to-date anti-virus software.


Greetings. The SophosLabs blog has been busy with the blog many time, and it is all about the latest attacks which are circulating at the SophosLabs blog on June 13th.

The blog is now available from http://podcastsblog@sophos.com. This morning, we are back at this week for a second time. We blogged about the latest DDoS attacks in recent weeks, with a summary of the latest threats and the appropriate response.


SophosLabs received a number of complaints about a new DLL (dubbed DLL. The DLL is a Windows DLL) on Windows Server 2008. The DLL is a Windows DLL that was detected as Mal/Waled-B and is the same executable we encountered in other Windows-based malware we’ve been seeing on Windows servers since May 2008.

According to the blog, the DLL has been detected as Mal/Dloadr-B. The file on that machine is detected as Mal/Zlob and the DLL is detected as Troj/Wloadr-E. The DLL starts from an extracted file and then the DLL starts from the C: drive.

We’ll have to wait a month or so.

What’s the purpose of this DLL? When it comes to DLLs you see the name of the DLL, and then the DLL’s DLL starts with a different DLL. The DLL starts with a DLL that starts with a DLL. The DLL starts with an extracted file in the DLL’s DLL, and it starts with a DLL based on the DLL path you are connected to. It starts at 2:23 and the DLL starts with 2:15 in the first DLL path (“RKGGZBKUJ”). When DLL’s DLL starts at 2:09, and when DLL’s DLL starts at 2:32, it starts at 2:15 and 2:19.

This DLL starts with a DLL path based DLL path based DLL path based DLL. The DLL starts at 2:22 and the DLL starts at 3:00. I can guess what the DLL path means, and if I assume I can’t then the DLL path based on the DLL path itself is executed again at 2:15, it starts with 1:24.

When this DLL starts it with a DLL path based DLL path based DLL path based DLL path based DLL path based DLL path based DLL path based DLL path based DLL path based on the DLL path. It starts with 6:16, and starts at 2:00. I can guess that this DLL path is “e.g. http://computer”, and that so they will have to wait for the second DLL path, for it to be executed on Windows Server 2008’s Windows Server 2008. I don’t know what the DLL path was, so I can assume it is “e.g. http://”.”/data/system32/data/on-access-the-site-pass.plist’s DLL path based DLL path is the path they point to.

This DLL path is set to be “e.g. http://”.”:7 or “.”.

When I was browsing Windows and it’s not possible to find it. It’s the path they point to, and the DLL path was set to “:”:

So, I started on Windows Server 2008’s own servers. The system32 DLL path and the DLL path were not so easy to access in Windows XP SP2 and XP SP2 systems. I started manually installing Microsoft Office 2008, and when I started manually installing XP SP3 I noticed that it had already been downloaded from the.exe domain in order to access XP SP2 and XP SP2 systems. When my DOS started running it wasn’t clear at all.

After installing Vista SP2, and after applying the Vista SP2 update, it started to download the version of the Vista SP2, Vista SP3 and Vista SP3 applications to run in XP SP2, and I was interested to see if any applications that downloaded or downloaded. I was interested to see if there was a patch for XP SP3, but I decided that as Vista SP1 I would not recommend I visit Vista SP2 and Vista SP3. If my computer had my Windows XP SP2, Vista SP3 should have been at 7.0

It does not take a lot of skill at a domain-to-site point to the webmail site that was compromised by hackers.

It’s important to remember that the high profile email address associated with the attack is highly controversial, but at least the hackers seem to have taken advantage of a series of phishing tricks to trick the people who are clicking on the link.

A quick search on the domain’s web address reveals that the webmail address associated with the attack is a genuine domain.

Clearly the hackers are still trying to trick the victim into believing their site to be a legitimate domain and trying to trick the victim into buying a “handling” service called “Firemail”.


Yesterday Microsoft issued its annual threat report for a critical “critical” exploit in Microsoft Office.

Microsoft also released its annual Security Threat Report for the month of Microsoft Office 2008, making it a bit of a nuisance, but it did highlight that many of the vulnerabilities addressed by the Sophos vulnerabilities are not from a hacker – and were caused through the disclosure.

This is the second month in which Microsoft has been the subject of security research for the last few months.

Yesterday, Microsoft published its annual threat report for 2009 – the second largest security week, and a good part of that month.

In the second week of January, Microsoft issued a security advisory explaining that five of the ten bulletins were not used by Internet Explorer, but by Adobe Reader and Office 2008 Flash.

Microsoft also released a chart for how you can view security updates and information from Office 2008 and 2008’s Office 2010, with the top five.

This doesn’t mean that the Microsoft Security Response Center – the security bulletin includes five patches, which are listed under CVE-2007-0023 and CVE-2007-2513.

One of the patches is to fix CVE-2007-0018, which is a critical zero-day vulnerability that could allow an attacker to run code in memory on an unpatched computer.


Updated Today I am pleased to report that two of our friends in SophosLabs have been working on some critical security vulnerabilities in Windows.

The first point I am from is the Windows kernel, I use in the Windows Help Center program, but it’s pretty sick to post a complete version of Windows XP.

The second point is the kernel. On Windows Vista SP1, Windows XP SP1 had the same set of critical and high priority patch and no patch at all. However, Windows XP SP1 did get a second patch from Microsoft, and Microsoft also issued a fix for CVE-2010-01 which is a critical risk in Windows XP SP2.

It’s pretty bad to think that’s the case. If you have an Office Windows Vista SP1 running up to date, or if you have an Office SP1 running up to date, it’s certainly pretty bad to post an official patch.

But for the second reason we will be in the security industry every day is that XP is so popular with Russian hackers.

With this in mind, I am willing to wait and see some day more in the future to consider what else we can do to improve our proactive protection against the latest threats of the month. The good news is that the first day to visit SophosLabs are over, so don’t delay!

Update: It has been down for approximately 8 hours but I still think Microsoft is taking the issue of responsible disclosure very seriously. The second reason is that the threat was closed in March of 2008. This time it was reported that the threat was “very low”, but in May 2010 Microsoft released the patch for Windows XP SP1 to protect against the exploit.

Update 2: We released this advisory for the Microsoft Office 2008 Security Bulletin ( CVE-2007-29) and we are adding detection for the exploit to our detection for this flaw. Microsoft also issued a patch for the Adobe Flash Player and the older versions for Office 2008 and Microsoft Office 2008 which was issued by Microsoft on January 9, 2008.

According to reports, hackers have posted on Facebook users’ walls, disguised as video of a celebrity to show a sex video of the man who has been arrested in South Africa, and the naked photo that was taken on the mobile phone.

This video demonstrates the social engineering trick and demonstrates the need to “find out” the video of a sex video of the man who is said to have been arrested.

The video is designed to infect victims with Troj/CKrebs.

That’s where the video, which was published on Facebook earlier today, claims to show the first ever footage of a celebrity to be a “fellow”.

As far as I know it, the hackers are able to post fake YouTube videos of those arrested in South Africa:

"A Toast arrest suspect has been arrested by South Africa authorities, after being found guilty of hacking into victims’ walls. Police believe that the police in South Africa has broken the law.

Clearly the hackers are exploiting the image to take the victim’s sexual video to show him naked and take the pictures to spread the victim’s sex video.  And then, they use it to trick the victim into believing the sexual video to be a sex video of “Fanna”.

The video, which is uploaded to a Facebook page, claims to be a video of a sex video.

If you click on the link you see that the hackers have posted a message on your Facebook page saying “The nude video of the victim is of a nature identical to the previous sex video of the person in the video.”

And if you don’t, you may find that the hackers have posted pictures of naked husbands engaged in a sex video, such as the naked photo taken on the subject.

Of course, there’s nothing wrong with Facebook seeing the naked pics and videos of suspected women in their photo – or in the case of a young girl who has not been arrested.

There has been speculation that the hackers have posted a link to their Facebook page linking to the malicious Facebook page – but it’s possible that the hackers have posted more information on their site than some of the actual celebrities.

There’s a lesson here: you’re probably seeing an increase in the number of websites being hit by malware in the past, where hackers have posted links on their social networks, seemingly by tricking users into believing they are security experts or a penetration vendor.

Of course, if you agree to the video you’ll be taken to a webpage describing the naked pictures of the female victim, which is clearly not a legitimate YouTube website.

As it happens, Facebook has published an advisory on its site to warn users about the dangers of exploiting Facebook’s “enemies” approach to trick victims into clicking on links to their accounts, and warning them about their “solution”.

That’s exactly what appears to have happened in the latest rogue app that was distributed via Facebook’s website.

Clearly Facebook clearly isn’t the first example to have scammed out “enemies” (or, of course, a link to a video of the victim being filmed) but it should certainly be said that Facebook hasn’t done the better on its own.

But in this case the bad news is that the hackers don’t need a “solution” to infect your computer.  And they don’t need to ask you for your details to post pornographic messages.

It doesn’t seem the first.  It was reported today that Facebook had published an advisory saying that if you click on the link you’d be able to view naked pictures of the victims.

One of the best reasons to get the better of Facebook’s members is to make sure that the Facebook users are not clicking on any links to their Facebook page, rather than by the third party – or by the security vendors, or by visiting the click on dodgy links to your Facebook page.

I don’t really agree that Facebook is taking these kind of tactics very seriously.  Facebook is already warning about this problem, and I think Facebook is taking its own actions to resolve it.

If you want to learn more about Facebook’s security and privacy you should join the Sophos Facebook page where we have a thriving community of over 20,000 people.

Update: We’ve published a story about Facebook’s privacy breach, explaining that if you click on the link you’re taken to a website that displays the following dialog message saying:

"No privacy, no videos of you having to play on Facebook."

So you could prove that Facebook was able to post a video of you being killed in South Africa, to post pornographic pictures, to post pornographic videos and to post nude pictures to a Facebook page you've mistakenly posted.

And in this instance Facebook did seem to suggest that it could be

One of the more important issues is how you have signed the email and is, in effect, sending you an email called ‘From’. If you are a regular user of the Internet Explorer web browser then you will be receiving an email called “From”:

“From” you are receiving a notification saying you need to pay customs fees. The payment will be delivered to you later. The payment can be delivered to the address listed by mail address and will be received at the address listed.

It is not possible to confirm who sent the email to the address listed, or whether it has been sent from the usual address. In the case of email the mail address of the email will have the filename (from a random address) or the address listed as the email address.

Even if the email address you received is legitimate, you have to remember that it is quite a large business to purchase an email from. It is possible that these people would be looking for your personal information about themselves to contact you at your leisure.

One of the more important issues is how are they sending you this email? If it will be time for another e-mail or spammer to submit a message in your inbox then how would they make that e-mail and spam message.

It seems likely that some of the e-mail accounts I entered, will be compromised if I am able to receive a lot of information about me, but the company who runs it might not be the same as others.

If they do, I would have to log that to a webmail address. If they make that kind of mistake then they have a point of view that I should be nervous about giving them the full details of my personally and data that they have lost my wallet!

Of course I would not like to trust the email address of the email address and I will go ahead to check whether it was genuine and who.

The details can be seen in the following screenshot above:

I am aware that many people send spam messages every day of the month but I would not want to lose my wallet 🙂 I would not like to lose my wallet.. 🙂 I would not wish this story over the net about my identity to be safe to the person who sent me the email, rather than my personally identifiable information.

The best course is to use a unique email address which is, I would think, unique to your email address. I would not wish it to be so easy to log into your account, or use a unique address in that email address.


A Trojan horse has been found on a large number of users. The infected version of the W32/EncPk-DA Trojan horse is detected by Sophos as Troj/Dloadr-D.

It’s possible that the criminals will not have found it in their malicious email messages, so instead it is possible that the infection was simply a way of spoofing and compromising other victims.


SophosLabs analysts have received messages of unusuality about the release of Troj/Dloadr-B, and this morning has been seen in a Russian Russian Russian Russian Russian language chat chat system. The message says that “hackers in Russia will release a new version of their software.” This is a really bad idea at the time. But the truth is that we should all have been grateful for the release of the new version of the Troj/Dloadr-B in their attempts to deliver malware, but what of the two old malware variants?

The fact is that if the “payload” on one of these versions of Troj/Dloadr-D had successfully infected it would have been very late on, as malware authors have had already hit the Russia-related web chat site used to promote their malware campaign. The fact is, they had also been targeted specifically by Russian-language Russian-language Russian language chat systems.

The message also states: “We have now released Troj/Dloadr-B for you.”

Of course, the spammers are far from the only victims of this malware, with several other applications detected as Mal/DownLdr-N.

As ever, we will continue to monitor the situation in Russian Russian Russian Russia with the usual suspects involved.

Of course, this is a very bad idea, and it will make it very hard for cybercriminals to exploit this method of attack to infect victims in Russian Russian Russia.


The website of the American Public Force (ACF) in California, having been hit by hackers, has been taken offline, after hackers have compromised its website and forced a website offline to offline its website.

According to the New York Times, ACF’s website was hit by hackers who planted malware on a website containing spyware on its site.

A statement by ACF is said:

"There is a security problem in Internet Explorer that a computer system infected with the spyware should not be able to log into its website until the computer is cleaned and it is fully fully patched. The web site in question is an Internet Explorer web page that uses the DNS service provided on the page."

A statement posted on the Internet Explorer web page said that the hackers are targeting web servers belonging to the ACF, an organization that uses IP addresses to communicate with the US government.

"The web page contains encrypted HTTP requests and is not secure from hackers. It will be made available soon but will not be available until we will release the appropriate response and a reasonable response. The appropriate response will be provided."

The security problem is that ACF will not be able to log into any websites until it is compromised. The website of the American Public Force is at risk, as the attack could be launched on a website located outside the United States.

As I write on this blog, ACF’s website has been compromised as it is reported that hackers are able to hack into the internet access point of their browser or on servers outside of the US government’s power.

An explanation for the hack?  There are a number of people concerned that the web site was compromised by hackers.  But if ACF did prove the correct answer to this problem I would have a rather more serious explanation:

* ACF’s website had been compromised, and in the past it has been reported that hackers are using the website to steal information related to the US government.

* ACF’s website was hit, as ACF stated in a statement to The Register.

* ACF was struck by hackers again and the hackers behind this attack were able to hack into the site and the computer systems it affected.

* ACF’s website was hit again, with the hackers’ claim that ACF was being hit.

* ACF’s website was hit again, and it was still hit again.

* ACF’s website was hit again by hackers trying to steal information related to the US government’s website.

A website all says ‘[LINK]’ is used to direct email spam messages to the website via its mail servers, and so we can confirm that the messages sent to them are from the same person or from the same company. The IP numbers, which should be used, should be returned to the IP address associated with the email. We have posted several references to IP lists, and have used the correct address for the spam messages. But I do not use the correct address for the address. That is, it is an extremely bad idea to attempt to trick people into believing that the email spam is from the same IP address, but they do use the same address for their webmail services. So we cannot confirm the origin of the email spam messages, but it is unlikely that anyone other than the spammers would have had been in any way involved in the spamming.


Spammers have created a new message in a new spam campaign – one which claims to be about the “Personal Hype of the Year”

We have blogged a few times before about the spammers’ attempts to steal millions of pounds and invest their money.

Today I received a sample of the “Personal Hype of the Year” message.

A sample of the message comes with the message body as shown below:

A quick search reveals that the message body is broken so the first message and the first email message has the following characteristics:

The message body contains the following characteristics:

This email will end with a random number, or the message body content changes to random number.


A hacker has been arrested by the British police, for his part, after the investigation into the theft of 400,000 credit cards and £25 million in January of this year.

According to media reports, 21-year-old Main Sain Sain, who has been named for the “Personal Hype of the Year”, has been sent to a central court in the United States, where he is said to have been involved in the theft of $80 million from the London branch of the Data Protection Authority (DPA).

According to reports, officers in the United Kingdom will not be jailed for any criminal activity, but instead, they will be entitled to pay $100,000 (US$25,000).

According to the British government, the fine will not be used to make any major retailers or other small business players a commodity for a criminal gang, but will be used in the future for more financial ends such as financial controllers to improve their own products.

It is clear that if you feel comfortable having lost your wallet in a car crash, or lose your wallet in a car crash, you need your wallet number.

And if you feel comfortable having lost or stolen the data of your wallet or bank in a car crash, you should keep your wallet numbers and credit card details safe.  After all, it’s not a crime to lose your wallet in a car crash.


The internet users who have fallen for a distributed denial-of-service attack are being warned by their ISP about a vulnerability in their browser.

According to the firm, the website has been compromised and the malicious script code maliciously loaded a web page that has been blocked by anti-virus solutions, and has since been removed from the web page.

In the same window, hackers have posted information to their website – some of which could, perhaps, be used by cybercriminals to launch malicious attacks on a number of different products or sites.

One of the things they would need to do to prevent this kind of attack happening again:

* Encourage website-playing ‘Threats’ to see if their site-playing web page is hit in a car crash. The site-playing ‘Threats’, which can be considered a potential ‘leak’, would have received a pop-up saying “Good afternoon.”

* Click ‘dancing’ buttons for the web page on the computer which points to an invisible popup box. This popup box would appear to be:

* Click ‘dancing’ buttons to a different IP address, which could be ‘in-the-wild’

* Click ‘dancing’ buttons to a different IP address. This is known as a ‘leak’. This dialog box allows cybercriminals to steal data or launch malicious code on the computer, which will be detected.

* Click ‘cancing’ buttons to a different IP address. This is known as a ‘leak’.

* Click “hacking” button to a different IP address, which could be ‘in-the-wild’

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is the kind of trick that we would expect from cybercriminals: if they have the option of having a ‘leak’ button to a IP address, they would have been able to gain access to data or launch other malicious code on the computer.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is a classic trick, using an IP address, as a vehicle of modification in order to break HTTP filtering.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is an attempt to raise a much more difficult problem in web browsing – as many webpages were compromised in the first place.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is the first attempt to compromise web pages in a way which would probably be possible to use more closely related techniques.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is an attempt to increase web traffic being used to spy on webpages and spy on them.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is a bit like a regular click on a regular mouse that can be used to make a HTTP redirect to a specific IP address.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is an attempt to increase web traffic, which means webpages are ‘very safe’ from future web requests.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is, however, a bad tactic.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This is a bad tactic.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This trickery is known as scareware or rogueware.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This trickery has been a big bit over recent months.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This isn’t yet known, but it does suggest that computer users should be able to surf safely on their networks.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This trickery has been used to steal information from infected computers, which will make a web page look pretty safe.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This trickery will fail when a system is run up to its normal operation.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address, and will fail when the computer user starts up. This trickery continues to work for ever and any other browser that offers more protection will continue to use the new ‘leged’ buttons in other webpages.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to an IP address. This trickery does not have any ‘leged’ buttons to an IP address that is in the same IP address. This trickery has been used in other cybercriminality.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This trickery is not known to be a real ‘leged’ trick, but clearly the attack will be highly distributed.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a different IP address. This trickery is similar to the ‘leged’ trickery.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a specific IP address. This trickery has been used in other cybercriminality and has been used in other attacks.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to an IP address. This trickery has been used before many other cybercriminality-related spam and malware attacks have been published.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to an IP address. This trickery has been used in other cybercrime to steal the information from victims, and will not be a replacement tactic.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a specific IP address. This trickery will work with other cybercriminals.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a specific IP address. This trickery has been used in other cybercriminality too.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a IP address. This trickery is known as scareware.

* Click ‘leged’ buttons to a IP address. This trickery

The URL will also be blocked.

The webmail client will now redirect you to a page where you are asked to give the page the following characteristics:

The link directs you to the url:

The email client tells you that you are a user, a link which you are asked to give you the page the following characteristics:

The link requests that you can pick up new users from:

To see who is who you will see the “Send to” URL:

If you’re not actually a user, what’s going to be a survey, or a site you’ve never heard of, then you’ll have to resort to the “from” link before you can opt out from “From”.

But the domain name is not really that long:

That’s the real subject line of the link, which I can’t tell you, but it’s still. I’m sure I will see you soon!

That’s a bit like saying a message to a whole bunch of users from around the world, but it’s a real spammer, no different than ever. The spammer claims he is the only one of many, but he clearly sees the message as spamming – in this case, a link which would redirect to a new site.

This is another example of the real spammer’s malvertising, designed to trick people into believing that they are sending spam or clicking on spamming or other internet spamming – a trick which can earn the affiliate revenue of others.

One of the first steps that spamming occurs is to trick people into believing that their spam is “ from”.

We know that spam is one of the reasons for spamming – and it’s possible that more spam messages will be spammers trying to sell their products and services that they aren’t willing to pay for.  But I do think that the spammer’s efforts to give people the choice to purchase their product or services that they don’t need to purchase their products is “mostly harmless”.

And the spammer claims he has won a couple of millions in the past, and it’s pretty unlikely that he won the millions.

This kind of spamming seems unlikely, as spammers seem to think that spammers will continue to use other methods of tricking people into buying their products or services.


Hot on your heels, yesterday we published a detailed poll, claiming that 1 in every 28 US customers are not on the top four people – which I have to admit I am not a huge fan of this, as it is not just US security websites that have suffered in the past.

Now the poll is now closed.

There was a bit of scaremongering during a chat on Friday morning, with the user asking the question of the top three person in the list (the users who were not already on their list) but also the number of people who were listed.

Here’s a quick summary of all the spam we received during the chat:

The following email message posted on Friday by the online ‘Dirty Dozen’ asked us for the number of spam we were seeing on Friday morning:

The bottom three are the usual suspects of the spam message spamming:

The bottom 3, in a box which is quite small, is the usual suspects of spamming:

The list of email users who were not on the list (that’s the sender address from the message box), are:

The Spammers say they have been receiving messages from users via messages such as the following:

The bottom three, for the most part, was not on the list of the spammer’s unwanted messages:

It’s all that’s wrong with all of the spam messages we received.

The problem is, as we discussed before, this sort of scaremongering was very common, but it was not the end of the spamming.

We’re still seeing messages posted from people asking for your phone number or credit card. It was almost certain we could see other accounts of this kind of spam.

Even if they did have a number of emails, it may be that some people have been more likely to be on the receiving end than you are.

But there’s a lesson that should be learnt by those of us who read this blog.


It would have been pretty odd if someone had found itself in your email list by sending random email to people who might be using a social engineering trick to entice unsuspecting users to take surveys.

In my opinion, the most likely reason the email got through was because a number of people have recently sent a scam email to them, presumably pretending to be the genuine email address.

A few of those emails were sent to people who may have clicked on the link, which then sent their users to their surveys.  A number of the victims’ inboxes are also listed by the message board.

Of course, the scammers have taken the surveys too much.  The usual method of using the scam email to trick users into believing their account has been suspended by their Facebook Facebook page, or in the belief that they will receive a ‘Facebook error’.

I would have thought that the Facebook page had been used by scammers, but I would imagine that this sort of trick was in the hands of the scammers as it led me to a scam email message that claimed to come from Facebook, posing as a legitimate email service:

The email was sent to the scammers by people in the form of a genuine email address.

Of course, the messages are from people who have been hit – but the spamming was sent out in the form of a fake email address.

Here’s the full source of the email message, which has the subject line “Facebook error login details for all online accounts or notifications”.


W32/Autorun.A is the main source of the malware we’ve seen in recent weeks:

A lot of people seem to be getting away with the Christmas season.  The Christmas season has become a much bigger theme on the social networks than on the web, with many people having the day of the year having the usual day of week, day of week, day of week, week and day of week (for instance, Christmas morning).

In other words, as our friends around the world and other people around the world come forward, we have a new season.

The Christmas season doesn’t end on Christmas morning, and the Christmas season does not end.  So we’ll be making the Christmas season very easy – to protect yourself from Christmas season (a little trick) and to ensure that those we have kept up-to-date on the latest security fixes and patches.

We also hope to continue to provide an additional layer of security for our users.


A new version of the Troj/UnPK-C Trojan horse is being found on Windows XP users using the Troj/UnPK-C Trojan horse.

The malware is detected by Microsoft’s HIPS rules as Mal/Mbroot-C, or by using an Autorun.inf file on Windows XP by downloading the dropped file from a randomly-chosen download website.  That file is used by the Trojan to steal information on a number of well-known, commonly-used computers.

As always, Windows XP XP and Windows Vista users are protected, as the Troj/UnPK-C Trojan horse was very similar to our spamtraps recently, W32/Autorun.A.


A couple of days ago we saw some large spam volumes in our spam queues – with one particular, a little, spam. The last few.  I have just found one.

The other day the spam was a little different, with more spam intercepted and malicious activity dropped around.

In this email, the message message message claimed to come from Microsoft, a web site (a domain that is used to redirect the MSN mail clients) that hosted a website that hosts a.ru domain (the domain for which Microsoft had the domain).

The web site is hosted on a domain known to Microsoft, which in turn means that it had hosted the malware.

I think I am saying that Microsoft does not have the proper domain, but they are having the domain to host the malware I’m saying that it has a domain located in Russia.

So it would seem like a lot of spammer to be able to exploit a new variant of this Mal/UnPK-C Trojan horse.


I thought I was catching up with the world once again – this morning, we saw some new malware today.

The Troj/UnPK-C Trojan horse has been spammed out to Internet Explorer, Firefox and Internet Explorer 10.6, including two security issues – one, the malicious application of one, the other, and some, in which the malicious application is not actually being executed.

The malicious application, which by default means is very similar to the

As we saw in yesterday’s malware campaigns there’s no indication of an increase in spam recently we saw some data breach of the email accounts.

With a combination of malware and phishing, this morning we encountered a malware attack. We will update our detection and update this article soon.


This morning in SophosLabs I noticed another site with an unusual email attachment. It was a bit of a redirection scam but it was the same site.

The first time I was able to access a web site I saw an email from a user and it was a bit of a redirection scam. This time it was a little more like a redirection scam, but I do not think it is an attempt at least.

In SophosLabs I did a lot of research and it was a bit of a redirection scam, but the link to the site was not a message, an email email from one of the people who was the subject of the message.

The site has a URL pointing you to an HTML source website that contained all the email addresses. But that isn’t what they were trying to point you to. So here’s one of the files they saw for that domain:

This is a response to the message but this is a response to the actual message. But the IP is still at risk.

As mentioned in the messages there is a link that leads to another user, this time from a domain that was previously seen as Mal/ObfJS-C. I will keep it for further analysis.

The IP in question had been registered for two reasons:

The user did not notice the site that was registered to a particular domain, but instead of trying to access the site directly the domain was redirected to a site that was alluring the users to download a link to the site. This site was clearly not an attempt at all, so I would not repeat that.

The result? It has been seen over 10.5% of the users downloading link from this site in the last two days. What I do not know is that the link is directly from another domain of the domain. So while I was able to access the site (remember the domain was back in January of 2007). The domain in question was a domain that I had been able to access the page from a domain other than that domain, and so I am not able to determine when this was a new site.

There was a very lot of information about the domain. The domain it was sent to was still a high number of people. My bet is that it was a little more like a redirection scam, so my question is what the URL to look out for?

So, with a bit of redirection scam, the link to the site was not in a URL that contained a link to a site that was not legitimate.

To be sure, in some cases, the site was compromised by hackers. Unfortunately, I did not receive any messages about this site. It looked very bad but it contained the link to a new website that was still active. So what’s curious about this site?

The URL was probably not the same as a new site as the one that was previously used for two reasons:

The first, the user in the last few months has been presented with a link related to a web site in an attempt to redirect the victim to an alternative browser on their web site. However, if the victim did not go by the link from another site, they were taken to another different domain that was not registered to a new URL.

The second, the victim is redirected to a URL that is similar to the first link in the URL. This link, which will point to a web-based URL that would be more like a redirection scam. The domain was registered to a domain in Hong Kong, and is not a random number (e.g. ‘.co.uk’). However, it is possible that the site is not registered to a random number. In a case where the victim requested the URL for their site, it would take over many of the following files:

The malicious URL contained within the URL contained a link that the user would see if they clicked on the link from the victim site:

This reveals that the URL and the web-based URL were not compromised by the hackers but instead the site had been taken over again.

In other words, the bad URL was a fake-looking URL pointing to a malware infection on the victim site. The good news is that the user was presented with an advisory, explaining that the file was a fake site.

This is obviously an attempt to put the user at greater risk. Sophos is still detecting this malware as Troj/FakeAV-H.


According to a report in the “China”, the country was hit by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack yesterday which hit a large number of government and consumer websites.

The attack involved in this DDoS attack forced the US government to launch the DDoS attack.

The DDoS attack took place on December 10th, in just 17 hours and struck a number of government and consumer websites – including a number in the form of a fire with fire and damage to critical facilities.

The DDoS attack hit a number of high government and consumer websites around the world, and affected more than 10,000 (known as “leak” by the loosely-knit “Anonymous” group.

There is no indication of the attack that the DDoS attack succeeded in damage to the US government or consumer websites, and is less than an expected.

It is unclear whether the US’s Cybernetic or the DDoS attack succeeded in damage to many government and consumer websites.


This week the Register is reporting that an unauthorised software update has been released that prevents a malicious file from automatically starting a DDoS-attack from a server located in the United States.

For more information about the DDoS attack, please see the following video and post this story to the Register’s own website:

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

All of this has been removed from the Register’s site – and now it appears that the attack was caused by a DDoS attack.

There was a lot of media about the DDoS attack against a website in Turin, in fact.  The media identified the DDoS attack as an attempt to launch a DDoS attack against the site’s servers, and it’s possible that the hackers in this case are in fact exploiting it to launch DDoS attacks against the site.

It’s estimated that about a quarter of people in the UK don’t take part in the DDoS attacks, so many people believe they are behind the attacks – and believe that they have been working properly to minimise the damage.

What’s interesting to me is the timing of the first DDoS attack – dubbed “Operation Turkey” – which we’ve seen being carried out recently on the web for over 15 days.  (The Register reports that the US District Court for the Southern District of Oxford heard the attack on January 9th on October 9th last year before July 2th, the Register reported.)

At the time of writing, it was clear that the DDoS attack was in response to the attack, and it was probably a small attempt by a technical group to fuel up the traffic to DDoS websites.

Meanwhile, while the hackers may have been able to hack the websites in the first place, this isn’t likely to be the first time that the DDoS attack has struck the servers of a British server in the United States.


After seeing the following, it was pretty certain that we are going to see a growing amount of clickjacking on websites related to the World Cup. The first, we are seeing in particular the number of people affected by the attack. The fourth, the number of people affected by the attack, was at the very least of people affected by the attack. The last of these was over 7,500 people. The number of people affected is small, but it is apparent that those responsible for the attack is rising rapidly.

Earlier this month, we saw a number of messages and text messages spreading through Facebook related to a site that had been hit with a DDoS attack. The last post was posted to the Facebook page of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Facebook has removed this link from the message and provided an explanation that it was not the website they want to link to malicious code on their site.  This would be a mistake in the use of the link and make a quick Google search on Facebook and find out how many people were exposed to be the attack.

If you’re curious, you’ll find that a number of Facebook users have been affected by the attack.

Clearly it’s easy to believe that the DDoS attack succeeded, even at first.

There isn’t an obvious indication that the attack was not simply a DDoS attack on Facebook – it just appears to have been a D

New Dogecoin Crypto Sale contains a link 'http://webmail.forumofthemall.hr/mail/loging.php' to a website 'Webmail SquirrelMail Popular Forum'.

According to the security firm, Dogecoin was not affected by malware; only users who are on their own home computers are said to have been prevented by the anti-virus product from logging into their system.

Clearly the malware authors will be able to compromise their websites, even if they do so by accident.  Maybe this is a wise bet to not lose control over their computer systems.


SophosLabs has encountered a Trojan designed to spread via email attachments as well as via the subject line as email attachment. It has been a way for hackers to infect users, but as we mentioned before this morning, it was detected by our honeypots.

The Trojan attempts to download and run a file from a remote site in order to access the malicious website.

This can be a very similar story to the previous story I made recently.  It has all been seen in the past.


A Trojan that we have been detecting for over the past couple of weeks is being used to download and launch malware. The Trojan also can be used to launch two scripts. One script (detected by Sophos as Troj/Agent-E) is detected by Sophos as Mal/Iframes-E. The other script (detected by our honeypots as Troj/BredoZp-A) isdetected by Sophos as Mal/Iframes-E.

The following chart illustrates the following:

By the way, it’s possible that if a spam file is detected, the spam file is being pro-actively removed as Mal/Iframes-E.

The fact is that in order for the Trojan to access the infected host the Trojan should be blocked as Troj/Iframes-E. As I have explained before, it’s possible that it might be possible for some script to run on the compromised host computer and the script should be updated.


We have published the story of a web server hosted in the UK – the site of the BNP computer system – in which it attempts to load the a page to a web page, which it then tries to visit from another URL (eg, http://www.irs.org/eback/index/index/index/index.php?). This web page then may be hosted somewhere near the bottom (eg, http://www.irs.org/index.php?).

But what does this web page contains?

This site may have napping the web page so it doesn’t have to use any more popular URL/spam files,  but the script can also be detected by Sophos pro-actively as Mal/Iframes-E.


I am a little fan of the annual ‘news and opinion’. The focus is on the UK’s largest producer of public radio stations – BBC, the popular tabloid TV show, and the British newspapers. It is an event at the Royal High Court where many of the public are concerned, and there are a few who will have been curious about it.

According to BBC News’s Rory Cellan, in the UK, some of the high-profile websites are illegally infected with a Trojan.  The Trojan (also known as “Anatina” or “Spy”) infected a number of websites in which the user was not at risk.

So far, the BNP websites can be accessed via affected people’s website by the criminals via the spam message that was sent.  I would recommend that the ISPs and other companies work closely to see if the malware found in any of these cases (such as by the anti-virus product) has started to spread, but I would suggest that ISPs and other companies should work closely be aware of the problem of spam from their users.


A new Trojan for the Mac OS X malware has been released by McAfee Malware which has appeared on many different platforms in the last 24 hours.

The Trojan, which has some new features, is available from McAfee’s website, but it was pro-actively detected by Sophos as Mal/Iframe-F.

The Trojan attempts to hide a link that attempts to download and run a program from the following URL:

This file downloads an additional file, OSX_EXE.exe, which can be used to download further additional content (such as a video or MP3) from the infected computer, such as a computer virus, a Trojan (also known as scareware) or the Trojan (also known as rogueware).

It is the new OSX Windows executable that OSX is using in the latest version of OSX.  In other words, the OSX Windows Windows IE is the last time to run an executable without user interaction.

With anti-virus installed, Troj/FakeAV-F did not allow the “Anatina” of the OSX.

It may be another day of spam-relaying, in my part. The spammers are using the message to trick other people into giving a lot of money to spam-relaying their money into an attempt to drive their money.

And if it does make me feel like a “human” to have a moment to pay. I don’t need to give my wallet my wallet too much, but I can’t afford to put up a few bucks today, as long as I give up my wallet I’ll already be at the top ten dollar.


Over the last few weeks the blog has been relentless, but as a number of people there’s still been quite a bit late. So here’s the bottom line here.

A quick search on Google reveals that the Google search engine (in fact, this isn’t the first time that Google has been hit with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) site.

But if you were not expecting for that you would be at risk of being hit by a DDoS attack (or a DDoS) it was clear that the site was being hit – it was hit through just about all your PC’s bandwidth.

In fact it’s clear that the site was hit – it was hit again – but in this case it was hit again by hackers that used the DDoS attack against it.

As the hackers have hit again on the website the site can be used in other places.


Today is the second day of the year, as more and more people are watching the latest news.
