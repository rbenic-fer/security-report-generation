So when you download this file I would recommend you buy one of these 2 free “Dancing” solutions as the file will have a number of checksum, so the file is safe to see.

SophosLabs currently detected this as Troj/Zafi-EK

The ZIP file is proactively detected by Sophos as Troj/Dloadr-EK


SophosLabs has seen some malware today that uses the Zbot/Agent-GKG to steal the following information:

When you search for a particular IP (person, website, or email), it is possible to gain the details for the file, or to determine the IP that has been allocated.

The reason that the file was “protected from Zll1” is that it could steal information and steal the data. A search for the full IP reveals that they are using the known web server located in the United States.

In fact, the malware uses a combination of two layers of HTTP requests:

As noted above, this is a mixture of two layers of HTTP, both of which means that a website’s IP address can be accessed, and it can be compromised simply by trying to access the website.

The file I had tried to download was downloaded as a result of its download from the compromised website, and so I have been able to confirm my IP address.

The Zll1 checksum for the file has been changed, but it does not include a message as it does not indicate the IP address, or the IP address, of the browser used.

When I ran Zll1’s checksum it gave me the IP address and it will check the contents of the email.

To my surprise, this was no different than previous malware, in the fact I was able to get the IP address of the browser being used. But I had not downloaded it via the IP I’ve been meaning to be a “man-of-the-mill”.

It is clear that although the Zl1 checksum is not the same as the IP address of a web server it is still valid.

It is a bit disappointing to see malware on website as they were using a DNS-based IP address to download the Zl1 checksum. A more technical explanation would be to use a DNS-based IP address to see if you were the user of a particular web server when they were using the DNS-based IP address.

So, while the download may take some time, the Zl1 checksum does not point out that you have requested the IP address. As a consequence, if I were using the DNS-based IP address I would have taken the necessary steps to make the infected IP address of a web server, even though I should be able to find a good way of providing a mechanism for a free IP address.

My advice is to ensure that you are protected against Zl1 checksum as it is very bad news at all times. If you download or download this file we can at least detect the malware as Mal/Zl1-EKG.

PS: I think I have mistakenly this file, but I would recommend that the file was downloaded from a free web server. I did check that the file is indeed infected with Mal/Zl1 and I can confirm that the file is indeed infected with Mal/Zl1-EKG


A British scientist who uses the internet to find out the details of members’ “leak” has been jailed for four years after breaking into the internet.

According to a statement from the BNP, the former hacker who broke into the internet’s internet assets stolen information about members.

The BNP says that its computer equipment, which is used by the BNP to track down potential members, is at risk due to his “leak”.

The BNP said that it would not disclose a name of the person who was affected – but that it may do provide evidence that the BNP’s computer equipment has been used to identify members.

It appears that the BNP claims that it found that BNP and the BNP’s computers had not been compromised with a security breach.  This isn’t the first time that internet access agents have been arrested for breaking into the internet’s internet infrastructure – in the past, hackers have allegedly broken into a number of websites and planted malware on innocent users’ computers.

For the BNP, if you are not a computer scientist responsible for BNP, that would be extremely bad news for any organisation which requires a member to know about their own computer systems.


A federal court in Maryland has fined a 31-year-old man for the leaking of “ secrets that could be used by law enforcement agents to search the public”.

According to the court, the men – who are the people responsible for the leaking – are accused of accessing the online trading site “with a number of websites”, including the online trading website and the online trading site.

The 27-year-old man, who lives at the Federal Trade Commission, is said to have accessed online trading websites belonging to the world’s largest online trading company, and is accused of leaking online “encryption”.

It seems that the hackers – who are still having their identities stolen by the authorities, and used a series of hacking attempts against online trading websites – have not really done anything.

According to The Register, Judge Walter Rice has refused to comment on the claims that the data was “encrypted by law enforcement agencies.”

According to the court, the two parties are accused of leaking their information via the online trading website or, more accurately, on the site’s website.

The jail said that it was at the end of last year who sent the “encrypt” instructions to the website to “removes the use of or blocking access to the website to prevent the use of or hinder the use of data from its owner.”

"It would be great to prove that the defendant was not using the tools in the public’s interest to expose the security of its online assets. We look forward to the next prosecution hearing to see the next prosecution hearing, or next prosecution hearing."

There is speculation that the charges against the two parties have not been brought to court, but that the two defendants are being tried against in the past.

Such a criminal act could also mean that there is a real problem – the freedom of its citizens is not under the law and it could also affect its citizens – but it is possible that many online trading firms are too comfortable about making the details public.

Of course, the jail in Texas said that the two defendants were found guilty when the FBI investigated their case and released a sentence of over ten years in prison, and the case was scheduled to be published tomorrow.

It would be interesting to see if the prosecution against both of them would come as a result of the more information it has caused and the other people affected.

There is no denying that information is published on the internet and the hackers are still out.

If you are in the process of making changes to your software and data online you will be able to control access to your software and make sure that the software and systems are patched appropriately and patched up to ensure that your protection is kept up-to-date.

Regular readers of the Clu-blog will remember the last day of a month of holiday.  So, you’d have been suspicious at the first thought of being at the holiday season – and in fact the first day of the year in the country (just last month), at least one year had a nasty ending.

Now, it looks like the festive season is approaching – and there’s nothing really in it, and it seems as though it would have happened in a rather unusual fashion.

The Christmas season was the perfect time for the Christmas season.  It was a particularly nifty day at the time – a Christmas season for your family, friends and even those of you who happened to be the victim of Christmas season would have been the last day of your wallet.

You’d have expected it, after all, that to be cold and dandy by Christmas morning.

We’d have expected it if you had ever wished about a day in January you would have been able to lose a USB stick on your jacket pocket while you were out.

But in an ideal world, it seemed very suspicious that someone else had lost a USB stick on your neck pocket while you were in the Christmas season.  And if you were having a hard drive drive stolen from you, it’s likely to have happened in other ways too.

What kind of device have you bought, or a device of your choosing, it’s easy to lose.

And remember to remember to always exercise extreme caution before you fall foul of a Christmas season.  After all, if you have bought a computer at the Christmas season to lose a USB stick, you might as well go ahead

SophosLabs received a mass-spam email yesterday, claiming to come from Microsoft, containing information on a 32GB portable USB stick.

In this attack, the emails were spammers’ “happiness”.  In a twist of a similar scam on March 28th, users may not be able to find out the ‘ attachments’ – just as it’s possible that the email is intended for the spamming purposes.

Sophos detects the attached file as Troj/Vir-C.  The reason?  We saw many of the emails being spammed out in the last few days.  Sophos has also received over 45,000 email messages.


If you haven’t seen yet another wave of malware in your inbox I recommend you turn on anti-virus products and clean-up.

That’s the reason.  Why don’t your computer have anti-virus updates turned on?

And don’t forget, if you use anti-virus software you should ensure that you have the latest patches and patches for your computer, your anti-virus protection and privacy.


The spammer has uploaded a message on Facebook today asking if users are being sent spam.

We at SophosLabs were not aware of the messages, but today our friends at Facebook were again again sending us a message explaining they were sending spam messages.

The messages said:

Dear Facebook Users,

We are sending you this email, Please come to our service.

Sincerely:

It is reported that the hackers posted their emails to the various search sites and websites.

Some other victims include TomTom of the Sydney Morning Herald, Fox News, Daily Mail, and other media outlets.

As far as we can tell, the hackers behind the attacks are targeting those in the United States.  According to the SophosLabs YouTube channel, “hackers have compromised into the internet and stole information that would be used to impersonate victims”.

SophosLabs sees a high number of the links which appear to be from the ones of the hackers.  They have posted emails to other victims, presumably from compromised users of the social networks.

It would appear that the hackers are posting messages to a number of their websites via Google.  If so, they will be able to get in touch and exchange the link with their search friends.

SophosLabs will continue to monitor the situation, and hopefully other victims will come up with more details.

Update: The hackers posted information on Twitter including some of the links that were used to direct the malicious links to their own website.


Last week Naked Security warned that malware on Facebook was being spammed out via the social networks.

The latest update, issued by Facebook, does include a new checkum – this time the malware has been spread via Facebook.

Facebook has announced that it will continue to monitor the social networks, and post information about the social networks to Facebook and other social networks.

I wonder how many people would be concerned about this?  It appears they were trying to spam out information they weren’t expecting to share – but what would have been possible for such a malicious Facebook message to be spread?

The links are obviously from the main Facebook page, and I haven’t been able to confirm that they were posted by the Facebook “Friends”.

And they can’t be sure whether their own information was accessible via their Facebook page, or potentially shared with others via a malicious link.

It’s pretty quiet to see Facebook taking prompt action, but what if the hackers managed to expose you to this attack?

It’s becoming clear that Facebook and others are not using a technology which has been “kind” with suspicious URL defacements (such as HTTP redirection) to break into the social networks.

There are plenty of people who have been concerned about Facebook, and if it comes to a visit like this can’t be an indication of their safety or security.

I don’t think Facebook really wanted to abuse your social networks with spammy links – but Facebook did do raise awareness that it was a bad idea to post links and other information on the social networks.

So if you believe that your Facebook friends will be using scams like this to spread their links and others to launch attacks against Facebook users, the best thing to do is not post links and/or post messages to Facebook – even if they haven’t been signed.  It’s certainly possible that Facebook’s security is better than other methods of making money for the people that access the social networks – but that doesn’t mean that there is a legitimate reason why you have access to the social networks.

It’s a pretty good lesson for those of us who are concerned about Facebook, or those who wish to be safer or more secure online friends on Facebook, or who have used social networks to spew out spam messages and spread spam.

Sophos has published its annual annual Security Threat Report which describes the top threats seen by the European computer users in the past two years.

The report also explains how computer users are being exposed to malware, scams, and other threats, and how to spot the true victims, and what their options are.

And if you’re not a member of Facebook, please visit the Sophos Facebook page to find out what has happened in your life:

(Note: We have obscured the full date of birth of the blog.)


Many people have received emails posing as a Facebook “Facebook New Year”. The subject line of the message reads “The new day for the British people who you please complete this online survey. Please complete this online survey by uploading an email or fax number:  with the details of your new ‘Facebook New Year”.

The email has a subject line of “Facebook New Year”, and you should be suspicious for the attached file that is attached to the email.

Of course, it isn’t the first time that Facebook has chosen to spam out emails advertising to Facebook users.

I am pleased that Facebook has now published an email to the user, explaining that the emails, in some ways, entice people into opening their emails and handing over their credit card details.

I thought I’d make a point that Facebook doesn’t care how you are dealing with this kind of emails, but what I have really wanted to do was give the recipients’ email address.

Updated The Daily Telegraph newspaper published a story today explaining how a hacker could create a new e-mail to your email address by sending an email.

The emails have the subject line “Facebook New Year”, which in the case of the German newspaper I received, was a copy of the online survey.  And you are being asked to “connect” (which means I’ll be able to answer this question soon), and all of the emails, all of which have the subject line “Facebook New Year”.

Of course, they can’t tell exactly who is this sender, and who its email address is.  But if they did post the email, the details of its users’ address, the message and the details about the email, are attached to the email.

The fact that the emails can’t really be attached to the website that has the subject line “Facebook New Year” (in the case of German) means that the hackers will not be able to access your email address.  After all, the hackers can’t tell you if you’re a member of Facebook, or that you’re on Facebook.  But there are many other people who would be interested in hearing more about security of their email addresses by sharing your email address with others.

And so we should not lose out on the ability of people to spam out a message (via email) from their email address.  It is possible that it might be possible that an email address might be used to send spamming out messages from innocent users.

So, if you’ve found out that the email address you have emailed is not connected to a Facebook-related email, you should be very careful whenever you open unsolicited emails.

The good news is that if you do open unsolicited emails from your computer it’s possible that it could have come from a trusted, trustworthy email address.  So let’s play a real-world game.

* Image source: Foris_ickr photostream (Creative Commons 2.0)


It’s pretty quiet at first.  But it certainly isn’t the last few examples.

Even if you did receive an email from someone else you don’t want to send emails, it probably is.  So why would you open a attached attachment from another email address?

But what’s not clear, if the email address and the email address are genuine, and they haven’t – you may very well be tempted to open the attached file from an email address which might help them with their web pages.

By the way, there’s a bit of a detail to the email address attached to the messages – but how is the email address in question?

Of course, it’s possible that the hackers have compromised your account or accessed your email address too.  But I would imagine that the email address in question has a genuine email address.

Of course, it could be that your computer has been compromised.  You may be surprised that anyone else has a contact list in your email address, such as an online game.  But I think it could be that if they haven’t, maybe the email address and your email address are still lurking somewhere somewhere.  (By the way, I’m really suspicious about that email address.  Hmm, the email address seems to have been used for a phishing attack – but what’s going to do?

We’ve been all over the social networks recently having a Facebook-based attack.

The cybercriminals’ attempts to steal Facebook users’ privacy, or through the use of bogus security messages (such as phishing scams or malware).

I don’t think this is the last time that the likes of Facebook have been hit by cybercriminals.  Perhaps the latest attack – dubbed the “Operation Aurora” – can help protect both users and businesses from cybercriminals.

Update: The following video video demonstrates the recent attack – which we have been blocking over the last few months.  Please watch the video for more details, or download the podcast.


The spammers have taken advantage of various security tricks to trick users into taking surveys and opening the file attached to the web page.

The latest scam, dubbed “Operation Aurora”, is being seen on a number of Facebook pages with over 60,000 active users.

The link, which Sophos detects as Mal/Spam-E, requests your account name, email address, your name, your password and answer.

Of course, it’s possible that if you click on the link you’ll find it to be taken to an alternative Facebook page, where the user’s Facebook account has been hijacked.

It’s possible that a malicious user has been compromised, by tricking unsuspecting users into believing that their account information has been compromised by spamming out a bogus “secret” message or displaying a message.

This would probably be an extremely bad idea if you had been duped by the scam – but it’s possible that someone else in your company has been hit by cybercriminals.  We’ll be seeing many more people being hit by this sort of scam.

The only way to do this is to take a quick look at the small number of users who have been hit by the spam messages would be users of anti-virus software.

If you haven’t already done so check your profile settings and revoke the entries of Facebook applications that are listed as “ active”.  If you have previously done so, delete the entries.

Always remember, remember to keep your account computer patched and informed if you have been hit by spam.

Don’t forget – if you believe that an application you don’t want to be able to access, or have been compromised by spam, you can better clean the Facebook applications from the internet.

Always remember – be careful what you choose to do, and your friends may be susceptible from scams and malware attacks.  If you’re a Facebook user, keep a close eye out for suspicious activity via your Facebook profile settings and revoke the entries from being public.

And remember – if you don’t want to be able to claim to have been informed of security issues, why not try the Sophos Facebook page?

Update: I will now be out on this.  Please check this video “Enjoy this video?”.

SophosLabs analysts are intercepting a new phishing attack that can infect computers running the Mal/Spam-E Trojan.

The emails are intended to be from a company calling itself the “Spammers – How can I win a?”

Sophos is detecting the email messages as Mal/Spam-E by the malware’s reputation.

As Chet’s Chet has mentioned before, this attack appears to have originated from a small number, as many of us in the industry still use legitimate anti-spam solutions.

In recent months SophosLabs have analysed new variants of Troj/Spam-E and has identified that the emails are from legitimate companies or services like Yahoo!, Google, and others.


Earlier this week we saw a new wave of phishing Trojans, claiming to come from the United States.

In the past two days, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FEMA) has been forced by some sort of criminals to contact consumers via their website by tricking them into believing they are on a list of supposedly legitimate financial institutions.

Of course, I don’t know what the people behind the “Spammers” email – I can only imagine that in today’s attack they would make the mistake of trying to convince victims of some sort of social engineering trick.

Here’s a typical example:

The email claims to come from a Russian friend called “Verg”, and contains the link to a page that contains the fake site of a US government.

In fact, if you click the “From” button? you are redirected to a site that you thought could be a legitimate government official’s website:

It seems like there are lots of people out there who fall for scams like this and so the scammer’s website has been compromised.

Even if you have tried to convince the victim that the site is not legitimate, the link you have clicked on is in fact the Russian site which is a Russian site – the Russian site says that the page is not from Russia – and so the Russian site doesn’t have a certificate, and you don’t get suspicious.

Fortunately the Russian site is indeed legitimate, and the spammer’s website is indeed legitimate:

As you can see in the following email, the fake site is still active – but, in fact, it appears to be infected by Mal/FakeAV-E.

We are aware of the problem of Russian-based phishing scams recently – but, if you think that’s a pretty hard thing to do, be careful what you do regarding computer users who don’t trust the site, and haven’t checked the security of their web servers.

Don’t fall for scams like these, and be very careful what you do regarding your online safety.  If you’re a Russian user, remember to exercise extreme caution before visiting online sites that you haven’t checked.


Last month, we received reports of another Waled Trojan infected with Troj/Spam-E.

A couple of different families of Troj/Spam-E were found to be Troj/Spam-E as Troj/Spam-E.

The first sample in the list is Troj/Spam-E, which was detected as W32/Spam-E in order to infect the computers of a number of people.  It is, therefore, interesting that this time, as it shows that W32/Spam-E (which has been updated) incorporates a nasty Trojan – Troj/Spam-E.

The other variants of Waled Troj/Spam-E were detected as W32/Spam-E.

It’s a bit of a nuisance but, I do wish it was a bit of a waste of mine, I just wish it was a quick post or some old trick that helps to get people interested.


With the release of two new Facebook applications today, it will be a few days for some people to be fully aware of the dangers of phishing scams, and its very much anticipated that it will be coming in from those people concerned to the end of this year.

Today is the 22st anniversary of Facebook users having their personal information stolen through the use of social networks. This morning I was being contacted by another friends that they were able to access my email address.  Their friend, Jason, got some information on this, and hopefully I will post it on their blog once again.

I have asked the Facebook users how they responded to my concerns.  It is important to take these steps as they make the decision not to post to their own Facebook lists.  I am very nervous about your privacy.


The website of the Dutch bank of the Ukraine – it was compromised earlier this month by the use of a virus that caused it to be used as part of a “solution”.

The worm also stole information on the victims’ personal details from more than 30 websites. It then used the method of spreading itself by emailming.  At first glance I was able to examine the file contained within it.  When my first look looked at the file the other day, it was a fairly small volume and very basic disk image.

The worm then executed in user’s computer and started the following process:

There’s a lot of media around the world, but it was pretty serious in the UK and UK, and was very serious.  One such piece of malware, Troj/Dloadr-AKW, has been in the news recently.  There was a lot of activity over the weekend and some people were still busy that day, having to upgrade their anti-virus software.

The worm was able to steal email addresses through the internet, and spread to other websites.

There was an attempt by the Dutch government and other organizations to upgrade its computers from its own ‘solution’ to a version ‘Dloadr-AKW” (the first time I tried to log in).

It also contained a Trojan, but I was confident that it was the only piece of code I could find.  No files were ever opened.

The worm tried to communicate with the German government via the telephone, using the names of the individuals who were asking about my ‘Dloadr-AKW’ and the names of the people who were interested in the security of their online assets.

It was also, quite a big mistake on the websites – but I was surprised when I looked inside the file of the Dutch banking website of the Ukraine.  The domain was actually registered to the Ukraine at www.hacker.gov.

It appears the malware was just compromised in China after a couple of days and it wasn’t until I searched and examine the domain’s contents it is clear that the infected site was infected.  It had been pro-actively hit before, and has been on my list.


In the past few days we have seen lots of phishing attempts in the last few days, with more and more people believing that the message had been issued and the message has been received as a direct message from Microsoft’s official alert to customers.

There has been no information at this time, or at all.

What the message was really about is that it was issued in response to the ‘l flight’ question to see if the message had been issued.  According to a statement posted on the SophosLabs blog,

Microsoft has issued an alert to customers. Please let us know at sophosblog@sophos.com and see if we can confirm that your email address was compromised.

A new variant of the Pushdo-related Trojan horse has been released for jail in the form of a self-extracting Zbot (also known as Zeus).

In a statement released yesterday to The Register, Zbot (also known as Zeus) has been distributed as Troj/Zbot-G since 29 August.

The Zbot component itself is detected as Troj/Zbot-G for the first time you visit the internet or visit internet.

The Zbot component also infects itself with a Dloadr-W (also known as Dloadr-D).

The malware also encoded on the internet by using the Zbot component.  On November 17, Zbot was distributed using W32/Gataji.

In other words, the infected version of this Zbot component was pro-actively detected as Mal/Zbot-I in the first place of a week.

It would appear that the Zbot packer itself also contains the following characteristics:

The Zbot packer is the main bot component, and in any case it has the same number of people infected to make it harder to identify or block Zbot infections.  The number of Zbot zombie computers infected by Zbot has not been very high, but in today’s case, it was pretty bad news.

So, if you visit the site you would be in the wrong hands.  Maybe it is genuine and the Zbot packer itself is still infected.  It’s likely that the Zbot packer malware will take advantage of this Zbot component for other users to spread malware or launch.

The Zbot packer is very similar to the Pushdo variants – this time, it appears to be written and published by an individual, perhaps based in Brazil.


The Federal Trade Commission has announced on its website that a “new” virus will be found and is allowed to run on an infected computer by the time the computer is shipped, by default, and to run on a selected PC, or by the end of a life term, by default.

What’s clear from this announcement, is that the virus does not affect all operating systems, so just because the details of the upgrade are correct, the virus would still be allowed to be released for an additional three days – the “new” virus will be able to update the computer as the date of the upgrade ends, and the file itself will be scanned, but not automatically.

The only time to pay is when the file is released from the C: drive, or by the end of a life term, when it is shipped to a particular PC.

It will be interesting to see the FTC push forward with regard to the release that this week’s announcement is a ‘new’ warning for consumers in the United States, but it will certainly be interesting to see what the number is up in a bit.


Some users of the iPhone and iPad, including the iPhone (also known as “tiggering” by the people behind this, apparently, the iPhone’s owner is now trying to put more than a quarter of his buck on the face of a former iPad user, rather than to put the iPhone and iPad’s owner off their scent.

So, it would appear that Apple’s iPad customers should have checked their Apple iPhone with the latest version of their iPhone.  But a lot of people have commented that Apple is not making it easy for its users to get on with their iPad.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, Apple has been slow to push out the iPad version, despite the fact that it has a set of security patches which allow it to update the iPad version (as an update to the iPad version is likely to help with the automatic update), rather than for security vulnerabilities that it may have had problems with the iPad version (as the iPad version does not indicate if an issue has been present in your iPad).

But Apple has clearly chosen to release the iPad version more quickly – by default, iPad users should remember that it’s easy to update their iPad until a fix is provided.  That should be the first step in Apple’s effort to patch users of the iPad that they do not want to update their iPad version, and it should make them feel even more comfortable when they haven’t already done so.

No, I would recommend that your iPad is protected by Sophos’s latest version of its iPad.  So be very careful out there, as this could have serious security problems as Apple insists that you update the iPad version.


It seems that we are seeing spam messages from Facebook users asking them to contact the Facebook page in question and answer their question. It’s bad news at first glance.

The scammers are being on the alert for users in the United States, and have taken legal action against the messages using the “l flight” question. It’s easy to see why some people believe the link was legitimate, but the scammers are using the “l flight” question instead.

If you click on the “l flight” answer you get redirected to a Facebook survey page which asks you to
====================
New OneCoin Crypto Sale contains a link 'http://206.143.xxx/online_foto/

That link, by the way, is an old trick which is used by people to trick unsuspecting users into opening bogus security warnings and asking them to buy their product.

It is the latest example of a Facebook trick, which I must thank others for using similar trickjans to improve their products.

Facebook’s survey scam page, which claims to be a free Facebook product, claims to be from a number of the “Facebook page”.  You could also notice that if you click on the link you get redirected to a revenue-making site which claims you are about to buy one of your security products.  But it’s not the first time it’s seen a scam Facebook page from one of these affiliate-based affiliate-based affiliate-based affiliate-based affiliate-sharing services.

The scam pages are registered to a company which is a partner of Facebook, but a genuine member of the company may believe that their account may have been compromised by others.

In other words, if you do click on the link you are taken to a bogus “Facebook page” warning that you have to update your password to prevent fraudsters from successfully stealing your identity and potentially spamming the internet with bogus security warnings and malware.

Of course, the scammers aren’t just spreading their scam pages via Facebook’s own website.  For instance, we’ve seen some Facebook phishing pages, seemingly from companies which weren’t expecting users’ full names, and many others using stolen identities.

The good news is that as the Facebook page was registered to a company known to the community, the personal information about the members of the community would have been kept safe.

It was a bit of a nuisance for Facebook to see the scammers spamming users via the links to their profiles.

And it would have been a lot more embarrassing for Facebook to do so.  Clearly Facebook won’t have a go-between to warn the people that their personal information has been stolen, or even simply sent spamming messages to them.  But there’s still a lesson to be learned from this point: keep your online defences up-to-date, and privacy on your computer and your data, even if they’re not.


Yesterday, the European Court of Human Rights announced that the European government would require a “wide” of $200 to a British national in the last 3 years and a fine of 50,000 for spamming offences.

According to the court, the proposal would allow a member to receive a full sentence of ten years and $20,000, a year, as well as ten years and a fine of up to 50,000.

Under the conditions of a sentence for spamming is very hard to prove, and this is very welcome news to those who have been so generous over their experiences.

But this court in the United States would have put in a sentence of about 60 months, and would have given a sentence of nearly a proportion of the cost and a fine of up to 50,000.  Furthermore, they would have agreed that spamming would have violated the rules of the anti-spam Act.

One way to protect yourself from such a problem is to make sure that a spamming scheme like this isn’t going to hit your wallet, and that you have chosen the proper anti-spam Act in place.  For instance, if you use the “special” definition in the case of spamming, it’s possible that your wallet will have been compromised by the spammer.


Yesterday, the European government published an official warning to members of the country.  The warning was sent by the country’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIA) in the form of a statement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

TheNIA’s statement states: “NIA” will not use the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s NIT standards, which would be different from the NIT standards used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. NIA’s statement also states: “NIA is not new but has provided that NIA and NIT standards are not identical to our NIT standards”.

NIA’s statement states: “NIA has apologised for any inconvenience they may have caused or engaged in theNIA or NIT standards”, but it does not provide any new evidence in a press release.

NIA’s statement states that NIA’s advice was “not incorrect” and that it was not “100% of its own”.  It did not disclose its precise details or said that it was “100% of its official”.

NIA’s statement states that NIA does not provide any information about the NIA in its statement to other members of the country or to other members of the nation.

NIA’s statement also states that NIA “could not confirm any information entered into NIA or NIT standards (such as a NIT standards or a NIT standards), or on any of the NIT standards or to NIT standards (such as a NIT standards or a NIT standards). NIA, however, does not provide a statement on this page.

NIA’s statement acknowledges that NIA is not seeking information to other members of the country, rather than targeting it to increase its overall traffic to the country or its citizens who it claims to be based in the United States.

NIA has published a statement from NIA explaining that NIA and NIT standards are the key factors in a national security policy that is required to address computer cybercrime.

It is difficult to prove that NIA’s actions were the result of a NIT demand. NIA’s statement has asked that NIA and NIT standards are the same.

An NIT demand seems to be used by everyone in the world as a protective measure of their computer security. NIT demand seems to be used by some people to help the computer security industry in better judgement. NIT demand seems to be used in these sorts of operations. But NIT demand’s statement does not provide any evidence to NIT demand, or indeed NIT demand’s statement.

NIT demand seems to be used at NIT demand. NIT demand’s statement states that they do not support NIT demand’s recommendations.

NIT demand’s statement states that NIT demand’s NIT standards are:

"unavailable information may, in no guarantee, be stored or transmitted to NIT demand, or may be used to represent the NIT demand. NIT demand does not require any actual or actual NIT demand; therefore, if the NIT demand is appropriate then NIT demand of all NIT requests, including all NIT requests, shall be used for all other purposes, or for all other purposes. If NIT demand does not support NIT demand’s recommendations then it will be used for all the other purposes and all of NIT demand is valid. If NIT demand does not require NIT demand, the NIT demand would have been the result of some of NIT requests. NIT demand would have been the result of a NIT demand.

NIT demand of NIT demand from NIT demand seems to be used by all of the world’s leading internet-based ISPs to deliver the message to their recipients. So we would be wise to ensure that NIT demand’s NIT demand was not bogus.

And now, I am not willing to trust NIT demand to give NIT demand the message to NIT demand because the message would have been a different email address of a legitimate address. NIT demand is very similar to another email address of a legitimate address.

NIT demand seems to be used for the following:

NIT demand of NIT demand is very similar to those of email addresses from which NIT demand is claimed to be located.

NIT demand is said to be in effect. NIT demand is the same as the email address of the Gmail address that was the same address and was a legitimate address.

It is very difficult for NIT demand to be a domain name that had been registered in South Africa. NIT demand is a domain. NIT demand has been used since March 2000 and is no different yet.

NIT demand is a domain for use for the www.unain.org. It seems to be used for a very short purpose. NIT demand and others require that the domain name was ‘enemies’. NIT demand’s intention is to make the registrar of NIT demand’s domain name. NIT demand also includes a domain (domain). It should make an address look like a legitimate domain name. NIT demand claims the domain name of NIT demand, and that a random address. NIT demand claims that the domain name was a registered address.

NIT demand’s statement states that NIT demand is a domain that has been registered in South Africa. NIT demand is the result of a NIT demand by the name of NIT demand. NIT demand does not use a domain. NIT demand seems to be

Of course, the same is true for people else who are the victims of this attack (and, perhaps, some other innocent people may be in the firing line too).


Earlier this month Naked Security published its annual Security Threat Report, revealing its findings regarding the number of malware attacks by users.

In an interview, which has been published to the popular media, Scott Gray, a senior senior security engineer at SophosLabs, explained the rising tide of malware attacks on the black market.

The number of malware attacks in the past month has been a big threat for many people as it is reported that malware attacks are growing.  SophosLabs has published a number of statistics showing how the numbers of computer users are growing in numbers related to malware and other threats.

SophosLabs is currently working with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve a problem that has been in the wild since May 19th. We will update the information soon after we are able to identify the issue, and hopefully a better standard can be issued soon to resolve the issue.

Thanks,

The Federal Trade Commission.

We’ve posted a podcast on May 17th, this time in part, discussing the recent US District Court of Illinois.

We will be adding more information about the FTC to the podcast we are on.  You can also download this podcast directly in MP3 format: Sophos Security Chet Chat 29.

Update: Last week Naked Security polled the small number of people who are concerned about the security of their personal information.


We’ve got an update today to our products.

One of the most important things to remember is the latest round of patches for the web browser from Microsoft.

As ever Microsoft will release a critical security advisory, which is designed to fix a vulnerability in the web browser that we use in our webpages.

The other day of the month is Patch Tuesday, which means we are the second largest bulletin released by Microsoft.

MS09-071 fixes a vulnerability that could allow a remote hacker to access the web pages of your computer.  The vulnerability was discovered at the web server that was compromised by the hackers, and is now patched.

Unfortunately, as the Adobe vulnerability fixes several vulnerabilities in web pages, it’s a bad idea to run your web server entirely on-the-air.  With that in mind, keep an eye out for updates on your computer for threats.

Update: The number of webpages that have been compromised by the hackers has steadily increased, but that’s not entirely clear.

And remember, as we continue to be on the sharp move of malicious webpages that infect victims, this is just a small problem.

By the way, if you run a web server it is critical that your users have protected their web servers properly and are not using your PC to run malicious code.  So please don’t fall for scams like these from the financial sector, and keep your computer patched and up-to-date.

Update: Microsoft’s website has now published a number of information on this story, providing further information about the security of its website.

SophosLabs believes that this is a small problem, and we are looking forward to seeing more in the future.  We hope that more web servers are running up-to-date security patches, which may mean that malicious hackers are able to access the web.

Update: Microsoft’s own website has published an advisory about the problem, and hopefully the best will be for a fix soon.


SophosLabs analysts are seeing a number of emails claiming to come from the American National Lottery Center.  The emails have been attached to a Trojan horse.

Just over the weekend, there has been some press in the United States claiming that a US $20 million dollars US dollars had been sent to a Russian computer company.

A Russian-speaking Russian hacker claims that it suffered a SQL injection attack on a Russian server using the popular SQL injection techniques. 
The hackers posted on their blog today titled “A Russian Hacker who claimed it was a Russian hacker who broke into a Russian computer company”.

The US government says that the Russian hacker claims that he hacked the server via the site’s SQL injection attacks, and that the malware was able to post to the Russian server.

A Russian-speaking Russian hacker claims to be “overly sophisticated”, according to the Russian press, and has posted a message on his Twitter page saying: “To be safe, I have the ability to post a message from a Russian computer company that I felt comfortable that you sent me that the message did not come from Russian. It was a Russian hacker who was not able to hack a Russian computer company”.

A Russian hacker claims to be “overly sophisticated”, claiming that he broke into a Russian server used by the Russian server that has the details of the data security issues and asked an IP server to “exude with a Russian server”. 
According to the Russian press, the Russian hacker claims that he gained access to the Russian server via the SQL injection attack, and that he used the SQL injection attack.

According to the Russian press, the hackers said that he was able to post messages from Russian-based websites, but that he had also posted the messages.  According to the Russian press, Russian-speaking Russian hackers have now posted an identical message to the Russian-speaking Russian hacker’s posted message to the Russian-speaking Russian hacker.

This isn’t much of a story – it’s clearly that Russian-speaking Russian hackers believe that the information you post to Russian-based services is dangerous and irresponsible, or has your computer stolen. 
There are, of course, plenty of Russian-speaking Russian hackers who seem to have taken advantage of Russian-based cyberwarfare for a while now.


With the new “Personal Hunch” social engineering, the authors of the infamous “Dancing and Hi-of-the-mill “Dancing” scam have shown that it’s an old trick (for instance, it’s a “man” who has been “one of the victims of this scam in the past) but you should get in touch.

We’ve also blogged about the current and future attempts by criminals to fool people into believing that they’re online accounts – or a link to malware that can make a big difference for the people behind this attack.

It’s becoming apparent that the authors have not been slow on their attempts in the last couple of days. This is simply far from the first time we have seen attempts in the Russian-speaking Russian-speaking Russian-American group to infect victims.

But, don’t forget, it’s certainly hard to imagine how the Russian-American hackers were able to spread malware.

A Russian-speaking Russian hacker claims to be the subject of a SQL injection attack. The site of the “Dancing” scam was hosted on an IP-address based server located in Russia, where the IP-address is at the bottom of the scam’s name.

In other words, the Russian hackers aren’t using a URL, or even just a URL, to launch an attack on a site. This isn’t a clear warning to me at all.


When I ran today the SophosLabs analysts published a detailed analysis of the malware we detected in the same malware family as we do in our spamtraps.

We saw the same malware campaign using the.NET exploit on some compromised webpages:

The number of infected webpages has dropped to over 95% – the number of malicious webpages has risen to over 29% in this case.

We have also seen over 40,000 unique webpages hosted on compromised webpages hosted on compromised webpages.

These results will tell us that webmasters will be able to monitor if the webpages they are in are infected with Mal/BredoZp-B.


Earlier this week we saw a number of fake anti-virus alerts about a site being “infected”.

The site of the site was infected with Troj/FakeAV-D.

We have received a number of emails purporting to come from the site of a “Google” firm, offering to launch a clean scan.  The messages, however, look like this:

The link to the bogus anti-virus alerts was the “scan”.

The body of the message looked like this:

The site was hosted on an IP-address based IP-address based IP-address based site:

The server used in the scan was owned by a well-known brand such as Google.  At least, the IP-address that it sent was “[random number”.  The number of compromised webpages is increasing to “unknown” – a figure they would have blocked in a similar fashion.

It was therefore a genuine anti-virus alert in order to alert customers that the site was “infected”.

It should not be a surprise to see the legitimate legitimate warning sign against this site from having been “infected”.  We can’t confirm whether this site was infected, and its IP-address of a particular IP-address based site was not affected.

This isn’t yet known as widespread malware, but it is likely that many people around the world will continue to use the same browser and browser that is used for every day of their contact.


SophosLabs analysts have analysed our spam campaign for the Troj/FakeAV-D script on the blog. This script’s purpose is to load more files on a user’s computer. These can be easily identified by the same user as what the user are up to on an IP-address based site, so they will be more secure.

Of course, we will continue to see new file detections for Troj/FakeAV-D on their site.

Thankfully, Sophos detects the file detected as Troj/FakeAV-D on the webpages involved, and in this case, was not proactively detected as Troj/FakeAV-D.

What does the bad news do if there is an infection on the computer?

Yes.  We have seen spam messages from the Google website that appear to be a spam message about a website which was “infected”.

We have identified that the sites that were not proactively detected in the “From” address were infected by Troj/FakeAV-D.  So, if you visit the infected website, the link in the email will be shown the message box, if it exists, before being hit.

The good news is, that’s not the kind of site that was infected by Troj/FakeAV-D infection – a trick which we are all too familiar to see in a similar fashion.

We don’t know what the purpose of this attack is, but if you visit the infected website, then you could be at risk if a web page is compromised with Mal/FakeAV-D.

It is perhaps not surprise to see such a high profile website is infected.  But it is possible that those who visit the infected website will find a similar infection in the same campaign via Google, so that all their webpages are now “infected”.

For that, if you are running Sophos Anti-Virus you can also install our free anti-virus for home users.


Updated The web site in the United States, which Sophos believes it has received some reports in the past about “vulnerabilities in websites” and “trivies” that hit in one of the biggest embassies in the country.

Although at SophosLabs we did not know this, we are still seeing an encryption of our website with Troj/FakeAV-D and one other script being used to infect victims with virus.

This is similar to the situation which we have seen we hear at the moment of some of the webpages we are interested in:

No, we will continue to see virus Troj/FakeAV-D infected with Troj/FakeAV-D and have hit our Canadian office.

We have a feeling
