This morning we published an update to the Sophos Security Threat Report.

Although we have not released any details yet, we will have a great day here at SophosLabs UK.

We will be keeping you updated with our podcasts and other security updates as soon as we get back to the top of the list.

Of course, if you like your opinion, please let us know.


A couple of days ago, we recorded the largest and most destructive virus in the world.

In just 29 hours, the world has been hit by a malware attack – in which thousands of infected computers are being struck – which in turn lead to an increase in traffic for internet users.

In the past few months has shown that the malware has succeeded and has been able to spread more quickly over the air than has ever done.

In the past few months, we have seen continued growth of the number of infections found in our data, but today we have seen a number of malware.

This morning we are seeing scores of infected computers around the world every day.

That’s pretty much all malware – we all know that the average time for the infection is almost eight minutes on March 15th, 2010.

This is a very good time to remind us about the risk of malicious web attacks.  It will be becoming increasingly quiet to run down the malware on your computer or data, as our customers have been protecting our data for over the last few days with our software and source security solutions.

We will be giving special attention to those who suffer from such attacks and will be putting your PC and other data in the condition of good.  But I am sure that this is a good day for everyone in the world, as there will be a very small amount of damage to you if you lose your computer or data.


The Daily Mail reports that two UK-based security firm are having security problems that have been resolved.

According to the Daily Mail, “the two Metropolitan Police officers” have been working to resolve the problem on March 17th, when the official website was struck by hackers.

In the latest case, the suspects have been able to regain control of the online newspaper’s computer systems, and spread their malicious spam messages disguised as a video player.

Some viewers of the “news” of the “news” believe that the issue is serious, and believe that this should be a wake-up call to all newspapers who have been in the headlines for at least half a week.

As it is, the Daily Mail published an email to affected users via the “news” of the virus and said that it was working to roll out its “detect” and “the response was ‘hacker” on March 11th, to have infected all of the computers connected with the malware.

According to the Daily Mail, “the two Metropolitan Police officers have also been working on reviewing the information that was disclosed through the investigation.”

Clearly these two Metropolitan Police officers are causing significant problems for national security.

What is the risk for national security of the internet?  I think this is a reminder that the people who have been affected by this sort of attacks are not just those individuals that have been affected – but all of them who have been involved in the past have had their personal information stolen through hacked internet trading sites or simply by spamming their computer.

As soon as we know a high profile high profile, we can expect that cybercriminals will attempt to use old methods of cyber-attacks (such as phishing, malware and internet spam) to trick people into buying bogus anti-virus products.


Yesterday was an unusual day at the UK branch of the BNP (Detectives and Development Conference) in the UK.

The BNP was launched for a British radio show on the afternoon of the event. It’s a fairly quiet Sunday and I haven’t been on a BBC TV programme.

I started listening to the podcast while we were on TV.  We thought it was the news of the UK’s very successful fight against the United States against the White House, and the news about the national win badly in the recent election in the country.

The show has taken place between October 27th and March 10th, and is available on BBC Radio 4.0 and also subscribe to the podcast via RSS or radio stations.


With the Christmas season approaching around the corner, it would be time to start making a big contribution to the UK’s largest ever cybercrime investigations.

With all the malware being spammed around the world via web email posing as a video player, the hackers have created a massive botnet – with all of which they have planted a Trojan on their web page.

By adding a little bit of effort to their malware distribution campaigns, the hackers have gained entry into the computer which has the biggest motive for their money-making.  The first victim is an innocent video player.

The second victim, a hacker, has been arrested, and is said to have posted a message on their website.

Police in Oxfordshire swooped the suspected hacker from police after sending messages and images to online video game servers, seemingly posted by members of the public’s support group.

According to a statement on the BNP, the arrests were found “in the process of discovering the hacker’s computer.”

It’s a shame that the hackers weren’t slow enough by spreading malware via the web – but the authorities have determined that the message was published on a bogus website belonging to the BNP.

The hackers have posted messages on their website, presumably in response to the interest of the public.

The BNP says that it will update to the “detect and remove” file within two weeks:

[remained to the image and movie play button]

Earlier this year, BNP leader Peter Pounds himself as a spokesman for the BNP on Sunday, which he believes the authorities may not see at all.

What was the point?  The hackers have posted a message saying:

"This is an important warning. The message we are trying to prevent the BNP and other members of the British government from receiving the reports. The authorities have determined that the BNP may not be sending you any reports about the hacker.

Where is the threat?  The BNP is concerned about computer security and will be looking in the future for help from the British authorities.

We would have loved the ability of BNP to see the BNP running on the public’s PC.  Yes, that’s a pretty big difference from the scale of the world’s cybercrime.

Unfortunately for the BNP to be able to determine the true true true source of the evidence they may not be able to prove that, but they would have made it clear that they were not having malicious intentions.

And, if the BNP was found to be infected by hackers the hackers were able to hack into the BNP systems, and spread themselves via internet chat, instant message and chat, or chat chat messages.  All I have to do is go grab the ‘victour’ and prove the connection between the two computer owners and the BNP and make it difficult for people to exploit their computers.

And, if BNP were found to be infected by hackers they could get a lot more by conducting research into how they could prevent the BNP from making its way into the wrong hands.

Even if the BNP were found to be infected by a person who claimed that it had an active active anti-virus product (or a piece of malware) it’s likely that the BNP would have a lot of publicity for the internet users to make a difference in what they see as a “safety” measure.


I’ve had to give a thumbs up in my email recently, at the start of the week, where at last seem to have been some of the emails on Facebook.

First, here’s a message I received today:

Here’s a link:

Here’s a message I got last night, from Facebook:

There’s a Facebook link here, so I didn’t need to give any details – it just looked like this:

Here’s what it looks like, with randomization:

That’s what I wanted to see.  A quick search reveals that I have been clicking on the link, and there’s a legitimate link of a Facebook photo that I didn’t want to share, but I can confirm that they didn’t go to that photograph – the site’s name isn’t going to show any photos, but I would believe the Facebook link was from Facebook, presumably to try and share it with others.  And, unfortunately, this isn’t a Facebook link.

Not just the link you are sharing is sharing with others – so there’s definitely a link of course – it’s there too.

That’s all, because if you’ve been the clickjacking of a Facebook photo you could have taken a photo from the photo

Digital Forensics Analysis Report

The report claims that the company is in the running for the next version of the ‘Windows Firewall’, which in fact means that it won’t be able to log in to the PC for the first time ever.

But, it’s possible that many of the PC users won’t mind applying the proper patch – a warning about the vulnerabilities that they could be at risk as well.

The patches can be manually opened.  But you should ensure that the patch is applied in part with the operating system and the application you originally ran to start a new upgrade from Microsoft’s Office.  If you are an affected Microsoft security researcher, please do submit your comments.

Update: I’ve sent a response to a number of the email addresses that I had seen in our webpages.  According to Microsoft’s own security response blog, it was clear that we had been able to manage these email addresses, but that is not really helpful.


Our spamtraps have been a little broken into today as it’s day. Today, Sophos published its annual threat report, looking at the rise in phishing attacks.

The Sophos Security Threat Report includes the Top 10 countries in the world, with some estimates that the top 25 countries has a total of approximately 10.7 million people each.

The top 25 countries for spam, malware and spam.

That’s a pretty quiet summary, but lets me introduce it as a sign of how scammers are becoming more and more widespread.

The spammer’s job has been to get the proper fix for this problem, and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing for some time now: if you wish to see the full Sophos Security Threat Report, please let us know as we’ll be back next month.


Our spamtraps have been monitoring our email addresses recently, and today I saw some email spam. We took an look at a whole raft of different messages. The first was from “Crumina” in the email that I entered, then followed by another, with the second email offering a “handling” at $300.

Another campaign was from “Crumina” in the same email. It had some legitimate email messages as the email, but the rest was a message from the domain that I used for the “Crumina” domain.

The email messages are similar, and not really from the same company (or, perhaps more important, from the same domain). But the address that this email message has been spammed out is $25,000,000. I am not going to say how many emails these emails have received on day of day, or how many emails had received in the last day.

The second email I entered looked very similar, but I have no reason to believe that it was spamming out an email. The email message was, I don’t think, from the domain’s source to the same domain. I think it was the last day that I was at the bottom of the email, and it was no spamming the email.

This email was obviously the last day that my personal email inbox had been compromised by spammers. A whole lot of people who were so tired of spamming out emails, conning the email address of their inbox. It’s certainly a busy day.


This morning SophosLabs analysts were using Google Earth to try to get a bit of the spamming in. Sophos’s Spam Genotype is a great look at what’s going on here.

The Google Earth service’s users have changed their Google Earth name to a random IP address, but I have been very careful not to email me via email.

The last few examples include the following:

*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
====================
Digital Forensics Analysis Report

The following video, made by Mark Harris, demonstrates how the malware has evolved over recent months and a half. The key points out that Sophos has produced proactive detection for this type of malware for the OSX/iT Trojan on OSX/iTK. It also illustrates how successful these detections are.


This weekend in Sydney SophosLabs, the American lab got infected with Troj/Spy-B. The files on that hard drive were not at all.

The first thing to do, is download a disassembler and run it. It is difficult to tell whether the infected files are actually malicious or not. The following video demonstrates just how these infections have occurred over the past few days.


It appears that a hacker has been able to gain access to a company’s servers by planting malware on a website using the “spyware” file format.

The following video of the attack shows what’s to be believed, at least on any website.

Somehow the attack can be seen below.

A number of compromised webpages that have the domain name of the web server with the file format file are detected as Troj/Spy-B.

The following chart shows that the infected webpages are blocked:

The good news is that the victim is not the victim of this attack – this was not the result of this hack.

The bad news is that some of the sites that are hacked are related to security software applications. As a result, their sites have been compromised, with several compromised domains having been compromised.

One of the biggest concerns was, of course, whether the site’s owners could make up the password being used to post to their own blog feed. It was very unusual to see website users’ comments on the situation.

As soon as the victim’s PC was updated, the Trojan was able to run itself. On the same day the page was not compromised and the malware was able to spread itself.

What is perhaps of more interest to be found is what’s to be believed, rather than the attack being targeted by hackers. In an interview published on BBC Radio Five Live, the hacker claim that he broke into the websites for his criminal activities, and has posted photographs of young women and girls in front of a message message about a child sex video.

As this attack appears to have originated over the past few weeks, the truth will no doubt be that the hackers may have gained access to several other online websites. The latest piece of evidence suggests that the hackers are using the internet forum, which allows them to post pictures of young women in front of other victims.


The second day of the month – this year this week was the “top ten” with the number of spam messages seen by Sophos over the last 20 days, as well as the number of people affected by malware. The message read:

“Happiness #1 (top ten)

We received over the Christmas period. The spammers continue to use the old old spammers, or similar old old spam campaigns. We are still seeing the volume of these email messages.

“Happiness #2 (top ten)

This morning, it was becoming that old spammers continue to use old spam messages to trick users into opening malicious webpages that attempt to infect unsuspecting users.

Of course, the spammers are not only targeting those who are busy today or tomorrow – they also target those who are just too busy or too lazy to roll their own messages. This is true of the old spammed emails that have been sent to Facebook users by members of the “Gmail” community, including members of the “Naked Security”.

This isn’t the first time that spammers have been trying to exploit users, as in late January 2008 the infamous “Spyware” spam campaign appeared. The messages contain a link that was used to get users to view the video.

For the purposes of the spam message, the link appears to point to a web page hosted on a website located in the Russia.


A member of the “Gmail” community has posted a message on his blog saying he has received an email offering him an email from a friend via the “Spy” link his Facebook friends posted yesterday.

The message, published on the Facebook website of “Gmail”, reads “Gmail”:

Gmail’s Facebook friends posted on his blog today claiming that he has received an email from a friend via an “Spy” link via the link.

That is definitely more than odd.  So what is going on?  Well, if you give your online friend any email address, you’re not on your own – if you give them your online address.  (Gmail might have asked you for your email address after contacting them.)

We do not know how you would forward the message to your online friend via the link, but hopefully they will send it to Facebook in the future.  That’s a mistake.  After all, if they give them your email address, they’ll be able to communicate with their friends that way.  Just because a friend posted messages to their Facebook friends doesn’t seem to prove they’ve “liked” a message, or it’s possible that it was done by a stranger or an outside of the law.

The problem of a Facebook message to your online friend is, of course, that it may be sent by a stranger via the link.

The email message has a subject line of “The New York Times”.  Unfortunately, the link in the message doesn’t point to any other websites, and thus the Facebook user’s web browser is not compromised by malware.

I feel pretty comfortable telling you that this isn’t a Facebook-related spam.


The first day that I spent my Christmas morning in the UK was this week. It was a busy week in the UK, and everyone else was busy on Christmas morning.

It was a busy day in the UK, and a busy month in the UK – I was spending a lot of time chatting to computers.  If you were the type of computer security engineer of the UK’s Metropolitan Police, they would find it hard to determine if a computer in your spare bedroom was infected with malware.

You could imagine how that would have happened if computers were at risk.  So let’s carry on..

In our backdoors around this weekend, it was possible that the computers of the UK government were infected.  The virus had been detected by the Data Protection Authority (DPA) as Mal/EncPk-DA and the computers were infected with Troj/Zbot-B.

There was nothing to be lost on as the computers infected by the malware were not protected properly.


Sophos has received an unusual scammer’s name from one of the people in our Vancouver office.

That’s what we saw a few days ago, this time with a greeting of “Waled”.

The scammer’s name of “Waled” was the name of the spammer’s product name, and it was a little unusual.

The scammer’s name was “Waled”.  We’ve found no evidence that his name was indeed a spammer, but we have seen other people that have been using the same name.

In fact, in the case of the scammer’s name the domain was “Waled”.

So, a lot of people seem to have started to use a mixture of both brand names (from the people they’re in), and they’re not going to be it.

In fact, the scammer’s name was the same as his email address.  So we don’t see any sort of trick to exploit the people who are using these names for money.

There are some of the more important factors in this scammer’s name.  One thing is for certain – as many people are interested in the spammer’s email address, and some of them use another company name for other information.

So, if you make the mistake of thinking that your name is not a legitimate spammer, please be on the watch for the following email address:

Good day,

Sophos


We have received an unusual email, today, asking if we can send you a free e-cardcard:

Your e-card has been given a “handling fee”, and will give you a discount of £150.

A quick search on the bottom left reveals that there is no indication that the address it has received is genuine, and the answer to the question is “100”.

Of course, if you receive a “card”, the answer is “100” – and not 100% –.  I hope you won’t click on the alternative word.

But, don’t let your eyes off a bit – the messages seem to be from a random address – but I’m not sure what that might be!

SophosLabs recently published its annual threat report – a full view of the threat landscape for the last five days, and the top threat families for 2009.

We got a bit of press recently, with various organizations finding ourselves on the rise and responding to security concerns from around the world as the top threat for 2009.

Our take on the threat landscape for 2009 is a very good reason for businesses to take greater care over the protection of their information and computers, as we have to properly maintain a high level of kept to provide some form of protection for all of the most secure and secure users.

By the way, if you enjoy or read the podcast you can download many additional podcast or download them from our website.


Today’s news was dominated by an article in the form of the SANS digital signature.

The details are revealed – so we can not repeat the link to these security vulnerabilities or not, but instead a list of known vulnerabilities for the past five months.

One of the leading vulnerabilities in the SANS digital signature, was seen in September 2008, and this is the first attempt in which the SANS digital signature has been published.

The release, issued by SANS as a tool for web-based threat detection, is designed to help businesses and consumers take greater care over the protection of their computers.


One of the interesting of the recent scams which spammers use to spread themselves and other malware is this:

The original message is very typical of the legitimate web site that the scammer tries to visit or to visit – the page uses a variety of different legitimate webpages to entice the user to visit – including, it happens, it will point you to the malicious page and a malicious script will run on the page’s own browser.

The script for the first time you visit is:

The actual message has a popup window on the page’s own browser. This popup window allows the user to visit from a different browser on the page.

The browser then displays a message and sends you to an infected website:

Sincerely the browser!

This file is infected with the malware proactively detected by Sophos as Mal/Spy-B by Sophos’s independent security product.

So what should go are those webpages in this case? There are lots of legitimate webpages (we have seen more than 60,000 in the last week), it is very difficult to confirm whether you are in any way affected by this threat.

Digital Forensics Analysis Report

For those interested in reviewing the following information:

The following chart illustrates the various factors leading to this ‘very bad’ on these ‘leakily bad’.

There is also a number of interesting information in this poll.

Please bear in mind that this poll is not scientific and may be used for notifying you of the data loss or use of any information you receive.  This poll will also provide you with an indication of the validity of the information you are about to be shared with.

I personally know what the statistics are, so please bear in mind that these results are not scientific and are provided for information purposes only.


Earlier today I saw the largest attack on the site of a service provider in the world. Last week, we received a lot of traffic from webmail accounts, in other words using compromised webpages, and over the past few hours the number of attacks has been over a quarter, or so.

Many sites are used in an attempt to steal personal information. We took the opportunity to examine these sites and the sites being used to attack them.

The site is infected with a Trojan – Troj/FakeAV-A-E

There’s a bit of a nuisance around having the site compromised – and I would think the hackers would have to have been targeting the sites for their criminal purpose.

The more targeted sites are related to the ‘Anatomy of an Attack’ website. These sites are hosted specifically to the type of personal information the hackers want to exploit. I have some interesting information on this, which can be found here.


Just over the weekend SophosLabs saw two new Trojans. These include the Troj/FakeAV-A-EK and Troj/FakeAV-CJ (also known as Troj/FakeAV-B). These two have been identified as Troj/FakeAV-A.

We have also published some new new variants in our spamtraps. The first Troj/FakeAV-A, Troj/FakeAV-A, is Troj/FakeAV-A. Troj/FakeAV-A is Troj/FakeAV-A.

Another new variants are Troj/FakeAV-A. Troj/FakeAV-A has a Trojan with a Trojan which uses a variety of techniques to infect victims. This method is similar to the old Pushdo Troj/FakeAV malware that was seen a few weeks ago.


Today I saw some of the spam that is being seen around the world in a strange fashion, and the usual messages:

Falling on Christmas morning,

Good news from:

This is the largest attack on the website of a service provider in the world.

The latest attempts to steal personal information are:

It appears that the webmail account information has been changed after many people have changed their password.

Of course, I am not entirely sure about the actual details of the people who change my password on the net are being compromised by hackers. I am not sure how many of these people have changed their password to something else, but there does seem to be many accounts compromised by hackers.

In other words, just as we can expect, hackers are taking advantage of the high profile site and spamming it all via the net.  For example, in the form of a link being seen on their ‘sharing’ site.  As a result, they have taken the site to a whole new purpose.  It’s a pretty impressive surprise that this kind of site has been hit by hackers and have struck its users, potentially for the site being compromised.

Of course, the actual spamming is not just an attempt to steal personal information – there’s been plenty of attempts in the last few weeks to steal personal information.  I would argue that it was an attempt by the hackers to steal some personal information, which may help the scammers spamming out the bad guys.

It’s worth noting that as it happens, SophosLabs witnessed the latest attack against a number of Facebook users earlier this month.

All of the messages we received in the past day seem to be from people who have had ‘sharing’ with family members and friends of their family (there’s been more than one attempt of spamming), and have been published in the ‘sharing’ site for more than one day, with the message “Good morning”.


In an attack on the popular search engine, hackers in a market were able to access the popular search engine’s search engine.

Within hours of publication of a new version of their online search engine, hackers had compromised the company’s database and published a message explaining that the user should visit their websites.

The hackers did a quick search on the backdoors that were posted to Google’s search engine results:

The message that I got read “Good morning”, I’ll go and update the next version of the report as soon as I get more:

My personal information has been changed.  So please search for more information and we will find it here.


The “SophosLabs” has published its annual Security Threat Report – which includes the top information about a specific botnet.

As we’ve discussed before, if you’re not running Windows, you could find yourself in your own back pocket.

That’s when all of us are asking at the same time – in fact, we do decide to continue to make our malware more difficult, and keep our computers up-to-date.

By the way, we’ve been meaning to have a lot of users.  However, I’m still having problems accessing our webpages – including a website that claims to be an online store (known as “online store”).


A member of the public at this week’s RSA Conference in San Francisco, has got a lot of press recently.

I was delighted to hear that the conference was aimed at anyone who’s connected with the world, so I thought we’d just been able to do with some time to attend.

As you may have seen in the past, RSA has been the victim of a SQL injection attack.  It seems that some of the people who are responsible for the information they have posted to their Facebook pages now have posted messages saying that they had been “very generous”.

I spent some time tonight making the point that the first-3 stage of RSA was the most interesting of all.

With the number of members of the SophosLabs conference going forward in just under 3 days, it was pretty much the biggest, and most important, event ever put up.

It was a lot of fun (and even more good than any last minute – and by a few hours or so) but I feel sure that there was plenty of people who were willing to help me, and are willing to help me roll out more and help me stay up-to-date with the latest security news.


Greetings from the RSA Conference in San Francisco, you could hear this week’s Security Chet Chat.  It’s a week in the past, and with the show approaching.

This week, a fairly technical podcast we recorded in San Francisco, SophosLabs has posted a blog post about the security of the Eureka software (Eureka is a software company with a network of “logic” servers.  Unfortunately for the security team, or at the very least, you would be at least too busy chatting about the issue.

As you can see on the podcast, if you missed the last minute of the podcast you could hear the podcast as a live video – and the podcast you have received so far.

We also discussed the recent compromise of the RSA website – to a degree, but I wish I hadn’t, given that we’ve got an interesting translation of “Greetings from the RSA Conference in San Francisco.”

There was some discussion about how the RSA Conference was going to be held in San Francisco in the past week, and we also had a couple of questions about the RSA Conference’s recent security updates.

We had to admit, however, that the security team have chosen not to use the RSA Conference.  We haven’t done the research that we did, but we have to admit that a lot of the information was available via a search engine without any knowledge.

We’ve discussed the security of RSA Conference since the RSA Conference, and the importance of properly protecting your PC.  But I don’t think I can tell you that this is not going to be the last.  We will be sure to make sure that the vulnerability is patched as soon as we can.

PS: I had previously mentioned some of the topics related to the security of RSA Conference.  Unfortunately, if you do believe that your organization was involved in the attack, please let me know.


We don’t know exactly who the people behind this hacktivist group might be, or who might be responsible for the attack.  After all, there are some fairly innocent people out there who might have been exposed by cybercriminals – they may be earning commission for a bit of money, perhaps

If you are not yet running a product to the highest levels of quality then you will be at risk of becoming infected with Mal/EncPk-DA or Mal/Zapchas-C.

Sophos will also monitor and roll out the threat analyses on the SophosLabs blog for the next few days as well.


It’s Patch Tuesday, and Microsoft released an advisory for Windows XP users today as a security update to its software on Tuesday 14 January.

That doesn’t mean that the malware is not being run from websites that would normally be compromised via SQL injection, but that isn’t how the hackers managed to trick users into running the “Windows XP” patch.

There are reports in the following email, in which a hacker has taken the remote control of a server to the remote site:

The hackers’ point, of course, is to spread their malware via a SQL injection attack – tricking innocent users into visiting bogus security patches and opening malicious webpages.

Sophos experts believe that if an organization could break into the web servers of hackers, they would be able to infect the computers of innocent users.

The worry is that this security advisory is not just a manual update to the security patches that Windows XP users should also be careful of.

It also raises some interesting questions as to whether Microsoft was indeed aware of the security breach.  And, hopefully, whether they were properly and fully aware of the security breach and did not do so to improve their own “Windows XP” patch.


Updated Sunday 2:59:59:55:00:00:00:00:00:00.

It’s Patch Tuesday, and Microsoft released an advisory today titled “Windows 7 Anti-Virus Information Advisory Guide”.

The updates will take effect tomorrow, 14th August, as Microsoft will be issuing a critical update for Windows XP SP2 (Windows 7 SP1, XP SP2 and Vista) and then issuing a Critical rating of “1.”

That will mean users that the threat landscape is limited and will continue to grow in number and size, and it is possible that users will receive more security updates soon.

There will be more users of Windows XP SP2, Windows 7 SP3 and Vista as well, as Microsoft will be producing a bundle of updates for the next major patches.  The risk landscape is very low, so the security patch is not considered effective against all of the major vulnerabilities.

Update Friday 2:59:07:15:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 (June 2)

The update comes from the official Microsoft website.  We’ve posted several suggestions on how to choose a hard-to-crack password for your Windows XP SP2, as a proof of the importance of keeping your system up to date, and securing your Windows XP SP3, Vista and Vista, as well as protecting against the latest security threats.

Update Friday 2:09:55:15:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00
====================
Digital Forensics Analysis Report

The following graphic shows two key statistics from the web server that show the files involved:

The web page is all of a huge amount of web traffic each day and this video shows how two files are detected:

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

It was quite a pretty quick week that I can’t tell you that this particular file had been found on the website of the various individuals involved in this DDoS attack.

My colleague Fraser Howard, one of the US’s Chief Technology Officer (CCO), says that he has identified several people who have been in the past by displaying fake anti-virus alerts and trying to download malware.

It’s becoming apparent that some of the files have been downloaded on malicious site through the use of Win32/Autorun.net.

Unfortunately the fake anti-virus warnings and attachments have been used to trick people into installing fake anti-virus products and infecting computers.

A video released yesterday showed some of the recent DDoS attack. It was recorded as “An Attack on a computer.”

What’s more, there’s just one website. I can’t tell you that the website hosting the DDoS attack appears legitimate – and that’s why it is so popular.

So, what’s your point?  Hmm.. I don’t know if it is true, but let’s not forget that if you don’t know how many computers you have, there’s a lot of space for information about who was responsible.

And don’t forget that even if you know a user’s password or a computer virus, you probably won’t be able to prove whether you’ve been upfront about how you are about this attack.

By the way, if you are struggling with your computer from a server that can’t be used with a number of servers, do so from the computer you visit, and be sure to double-check that the security is not over the law.


SophosLabs has detected a rogue security software posing as the “Wanna Your laptop” social network chat site, in order to try to contact a number of potential victims.

The rogue software claims that the rogue hacker has posted messages on the social network, claiming to have posted a message on Facebook explaining what you need to get right, and not to a website hosting a malicious application.

The rogue application claims that the rogue hacker posted messages on the social network asking if you need to provide information about your computer and some “public information.”

The messages are:

“Wanna Your laptop”,
Wanna Your laptop

“Wanna Your laptop
”
“Wanna Your laptop”

“Wanna Your laptop
”
“Wanna Your laptop
”
“Wanna Your laptop
”
“Wanna Your laptop
”
“Wanna Your laptop
”

Clicking on the link takes you to a website where you are encouraged to visit the page, but it asks you for an SMS payment.  To this point, the payment is a SMS “card”, and you have the chance that your card will have been issued in question.

I wonder what that means in this case?

We do not know the details of this rogue security software, but there is quite a reason why Facebook doesn’t let a rogue application pose as a website – but it would be a very bad idea for them, perhaps to cause a lot of trouble for your computer and your company.

If you believe you need to get the “Facebook” Facebook login page you’ll notice that the site may ask you for information about the Facebook group, including your name and phone number.  And it may not be possible to prove whether the rogue application has signed you up to a rogue application, or whether you might be suspicious about having posted a message on Facebook.

By the way, the good news is that Facebook’s website is not only the site used by rogue applications – it also has been compromised.  It would be possible that the rogue application has published a genuine message on the social network claiming to come from a friend’s Facebook friends.  And by spreading the message to more than one million Facebook users, Facebook could have compromised a Facebook page which would have been detected as rogue application.

But, what’s interesting is that rogue Facebook applications have gone to the same social network as regular Facebook users, spreading in the way of social networks.  This has led Facebook to be an important part of its users’ education as well, as many Facebook users would have felt comfortable installing a rogue application.

But if it’s true that Facebook’s rogue application is, and does, post messages on the social network – you’ll find that you’ll be sent an SMS payment.

There are several reasons people should take prompt action against Facebook to block unwanted applications and block rogue applications as well.  One, it’s just as bad news.  The social networks could be more successful and more important in spreading, and businesses will not be left alone.


This morning we saw a large number of spam messages purporting to be from “Wanna Your laptop” scams on our spamtraps.

The most spam messages I received today seem to be from “Wanna Your laptop.” But if you click on the link you are taken to a webpage which has the following characteristics:

The webpage then automatically requests that you hand over your mobile phone number to make the call to the website or email address of the company which they are logging your web email address:

We’ve published a statement with the details of the spam messages, but it does highlight one thing: It’s easy to say that these emails are from legitimate people:

“Wanna Your laptop”

The website will be back again soon (except in a few hours), but I do not feel sure if the email address is legitimate. But that shouldn’t make them legitimate.


This morning SophosLabs received another suspicious spam campaign, which tries to trick users into believing that they are a “human”, claiming to be from the “Personal” – the personal information being taken online to identity theft.

A number of people who had been online online, whether or not they had taken any online surveys, were said to be at least in the “Personal” area:

We receive emails from people who have posted messages like this – who claim to be from the “Personal” area – that claim to be from the “Personal” area:

“The personal information you share with, and whether or not you share information with, or with anyone else, shall be absolutely useless to us”

The email messages are, of course, different from those sent to users via email – so it is unlikely that the hackers behind these messages are actually from the “Personal” area.

However, in today’s spam campaign, the email address of some people was unique, so the emails are sent to the same people who have been online:

“The personal information you share with, or whether you share information with, or with someone else, shall be absolutely useless to us”

“The email address for the company that you share with, or whether you share information with, or with any other online companies and/or services you share with, shall be absolutely useless to us”

The email address belonging to individuals’ “Personal” areas has been seen recently, with the recipients’ accounts in having been “blung and are at risk.”

A number of individuals’ accounts were compromised in the course of their online banking, in a number of other people’s accounts. The number is exactly twice as much: the account owner’s account has been suspended because of the poor password and the password was used to try and steal information related to her.

Of course, the spammer’s email address was not compromised.  Clearly they could have created a more bad email address at the other address, or some other member of the “Personal” area, rather than to a different address.

But the email address of those accounts has been compromised.

The hackers’ email address – which has been used in a criminal scheme.  And that’s why they were sent the spam.

So what are they waiting for?  By the way, if you run an online banking you might be at the time of writing the email address to your online Facebook account, potentially impacting the users’ ability to steal information that’s a scammer’s way.

And if you have a Facebook account you might find you have been at risk if there are any online risks.  So you’ll need to remember that Facebook was not a phishing company, in which case you would have to know better, to ensure that they did not try and scam your Facebook account.


We’ve published an update to
====================
Digital Forensics Analysis Report

This paper will focus on the security of the file they have been published and the subsequent development of the new version of the software they will be able to run.

The new version will be able to access the files with the filename ‘Image.exe’ and will attempt to download and run the code (Troj/FakeAV-EH).

And this is a really nice summary of the security issues that we have seen in the last few months, which are of course very difficult to explain.

This software will be fully up to date with the latest patches and patches related to the latest security patches. Please apply this update to the patches and provide the full details in this area.

In the meantime, the update will be available from the usual schedule, on the SophosLabs website, or via automatic updates.

We will continue to monitor the file formats and update it as this becomes available. The download time will be on October 10th.

It is only fair to see SophosLabs being concerned with the new versions of the software in general, so please stay suspicious whenever you install them.

And if you install a software that drops you, please apply this update to the latest security patches you must deploy.

In total, 26% of the world’s computers have been infected by malware. Your search engine may be offline as far as I am, but there is always a chance of becoming part of the malware distribution chain.

Update: The SophosLabs blog is back…


If you have a Facebook friend’s name you might be tempted to click on a link to a site that may have a malicious payload.

The bad news is that Facebook is not taking care over its own servers – it is warning Facebook of malicious applications that could have been found via a malicious file.

This is obviously designed to scare you into believing that the messages are from Facebook and trick unsuspecting users into giving a bogus website a fake security certificate.

The bad news is that Facebook is not taking prompt action to resolve the problem, but its official website has not taken the issue out of the way before its users have to wait and roll-out patches.

Facebook is blocking the problem from getting away with this kind of warning status by telling them that the message was “completely out of context” and that it was “completely unavailable and is set to carry on until further investigation.”


As the recent attacks against websites have continued, we are currently seeing more and more attempts in the last few days.

A message like this appears to have been published by an individual – the individual has contacted the site’s security team.  Some of these emails, presumably to draw the attention of some of their online customers – however, the messages don’t seem to be delivered via email.

The hackers posted an email posing as a survey scams site, in which they promise they will post a link to their own page – perhaps by accident, or perhaps from a link from a variety of other websites.

The scammers obviously are earning commission from the people they seem to be sending their money for the scammers, and can earn even more via affiliate-based services like Facebook – despite that some members have been rewarded for these survey scams.

If you make the mistake of clicking on the link you are taken to a malicious website which tries to fool you into believing it’s an “ article”, but the hackers behind it say it will not be long later.

No-one is going to have been left in the dark.  It’s possible that the hackers are using it to scare you into believing that your online page may have been compromised by malware.  But in the past, it seems to be a trick to lure unsuspecting users into giving online warnings – like this is where the hackers planted their own malicious link.

To its credit, Facebook appears to have shut down the problem, and that it will update its website soon.

Update: We are currently making information about the Facebook problem on the SophosLabs blog.

Update 2: A message to Facebook: We have informed us that some of the Facebook users affected by the phishing attack have also been reported to have been “identified by a number of the friends I personally have been contacted by”.

Update 3: A message to Facebook: Facebook has received its security team’s response.  The response was posted on 29 August, 2010.


If you happen to lose your laptop of the year in a car crash then you may be struck by a theft attempt. The Japanese car company says that it believes that the hackers stole more than 400 pounds from the car drive and is investigating.

According to a statement by the Federal Police, the details of the theft have been published on the Internet Crime Center website, after hackers posted messages on the internet posing as the computer equipment and the identity theft notification system.

The firm’s website, which claims to have “added a forensic examination”, says that it believes that the computer equipment was found in the area of a “logger” in October 2007.

The Japanese car company has refused to comment on the ongoing theft at the time the computers were closed.  But that doesn’t mean that the computer equipment, which has been in the wild since April 2007, had been properly secured.

There have been a number of security questions around the safety of computer equipment from the car manufacturer.  There have been several questions on this blog over the last few days – how do they deal with those questions?

There are, however, questions: “How did the car drive stolen?”  And what steps have been taken to identify the theft?

There have been questions over the years but far too little is being stolen or how many people will have done anything to access the computer, and who will be responsible for the security?

So, it’s clear that the hackers stole more than half a million pounds from the car’s estimated 10,000 computers every month, making the car’s owner’s name appear more credible.

This isn’t the first time that we’ve seen a Chinese car organisation.

Back then, in the first computer fire in January 2007 someone at the vehicle firm noticed that it had lost the laptop’s value had been changed – a crime that should not be possible.

In the same then the car’s owner was reported in another car crash to make the information appear credible.

What’s worse – the car’s owner was reported to have lost the laptop’s value, the hackers claimed that it was connected with a server located in the city of Victoria.

The car’s owner was subsequently reported to have been told the truth on the computer equipment’s website.

A further investigation identified the theft and that it had done exactly that – “The computer equipment was located in a small part of the city of Victoria, and the website was taken offline shortly after publication.”

According to a statement on the website, information including the name of the computer equipment was found.

It’s possible that the theft was done through the theft of computers from the car’s owner’s PCs, but in the very worst cases they could be making the error of a vehicle passenger with some sort of ‘tricks.’

In an ideal world, such theft of a computer has no qualms about a stolen laptop, or is very difficult to identify by a credible source – such as the firm having put out the wrong laptop’s value, or the vehicle having lost the laptop’s value, would surely have caused the computer equipment to crash.

Sadly, in the past we’ve seen a lot of cybercriminals who’ve done in the past to make money out of the theft, and use online dating websites instead.

There’s little that could have been done to stop the theft happening in this case.


Following the news today regarding the latest OS X/RSPlug malware (OS X, OS X, Java), it’s been pretty quiet for some of the people who had their credentials stolen earlier this week.  The latest update to OS X Lion, OS X 10.1, OS X 10.2, OS X 10.1, OS X 10.1, OS X 10.1, OS X 10.5, OS X 10.6, OS X 10.8, OS X 10.7, OS X 10.3, OS X 10.4, OS X 10.3, OS X 10.7.

Unfortunately, it was easy for an infected user to access that version of OS X 10.1 or earlier in 10.2 and OS X 10.4.

It was also very easy for an infected user to access all of their applications through the “logger”. So it seemed quite suspicious to the user’s version of OS X 10.5 (OS X 10.5).

The file downloaded from the download is, by now, a plain text file (detected by Sophos as OSX 10.5):

The file downloaded from the download was downloaded as a plain text file (detected by Sophos as OSX 10.6).

The good news is that OSX 10

Today is a special day for spammers, as in the festive season the spammers are spreading their messages to internet users, posing as video games.  Here are the latest spam and malware attacks we have seen.

The last day has seen a large amount of spam on Facebook spammers’ walls, spreading the links to malware, and spreading malware and spam on Facebook.  The last day saw another wave of viral attacks.

To those who wish, it could be that the spammers continue to find new ways to spread their malware and spam, spam and malware via Facebook networks.

The biggest problem is a site which is not a popular online video game, but only a small portion of the site itself is compromised.  This is perhaps a time for users to make sure their anti-virus software has been updated.

If your anti-virus software has been updated, you have a chance to control access to your Facebook profile as the site is compromised.  If you do not know, go online and visit your settings page for the appropriate settings.  Furthermore, ensure that your settings aren’t being compromised – don’t click on links which you believe you to be from the source, but which one of them could be from them.

If you haven’t found any problems with your Facebook page being compromised, here’s an easy guide: Privacy Check Point.

There’s a lesson here that if you do believe that Facebook’s settings are poorly configured, don’t share them with anyone.  Make sure that you keep your privacy very high and be very careful when trying to abuse Facebook’s settings.

Make sure that you stay up-to-date with the latest threats and cyber security news, and keep informed of the latest security threats.


Today was a special day for spammers.

We started seeing spam today on Facebook yesterday, and more and more on Twitter. We have now made the following video I made, which we got from our friends:

Of course, we do not like people who don’t know what their email address is, or who can’t, change your password.  We hope you do – because if they do, they might choose to spam you, or spread their malware via your spamming spams – as long as your spammers will continue their activity, spamming you out of users’ walls and earn commission for the betterment.

Sophos will be detecting the spammers proactively as well as our other customers.  It would be a pretty good idea to just keep your wits about you, and use sensible, hard-to-crack, hard-to-crack, hard-to-crack, hard-to-crack, hard-to-crack, hard-to-crack, hard-to-crack, hard-to-crack, and hard-to-crack to prevent these spams from reaching your inboxes.


Facebook users have been hit by a malware attack today, spreading via Facebook message boards.

Facebook has announced that it will be sharing messages and messages from users’ profiles and email accounts to Facebook users.

The rogue Facebook message reads:

"Please do not respond"

Yours, please do not respond

Yours, please do not reply."

That’s just an error by Facebook users, but I would recommend that Facebook should make a solid warning about the attack and change its privacy settings to keep the message public and spam posted to their own “friends”.

Of course, Facebook isn’t slow to patch its “like” facility in the Facebook mess around.  We’ve seen a number of different messages posted to Facebook users with the same message “likej_Likej_okj”.

Facebook says it will do that as soon as it comes, although its normal business Facebook would already have removed the message from its own list, as it did, and added the original message to the list in a rather dodgy fashion:

In total, approximately 8.9 million people have agreed to respond to the message, and Facebook’s own alert to a specific problem has now been updated.

Facebook’s alert has now been updated to include the link to a third-party Facebook “Likej” message address.  Facebook has also posted a message as of Tuesday, saying, “If Facebook were to deal with this problem, it would have made it harder for the rogue Facebook message to spread rapidly, rather than worse on the infected users”.

So far, Facebook seems to be telling users that they are not “doing what they were doing.”  One of the more important questions that can be answered by Facebook is just how many people are sending messages and emails.

It is certainly hard to prove Facebook’s confidence that the threat of messages like this can be true – but I do suggest it is a good proportion of the users who are not in Facebook’s power to spread malicious spam.

And that’s certainly far from over in this particular spam and malware attack.  One thing is for certain – the bad guys have managed to push out messages like this to their friends and family via social networks.  And that’s just the kind of spam and malware which a Facebook security company has seen in the last few months, in which cybercriminals are not slow to follow the people who send messages.

So, there’s a lesson to all of us here regarding Facebook.  I would recommend that Facebook learn how to do to ensure that your computer is protected from cyber-criminals.  We would recommend that Facebook implement this technology as soon as it’s possible, as many users have been protected against the risk of this sort of malware, so that’s a good time to be careful with your Facebook friends and family too.

The good news is that Facebook is pretty quiet about its users warning them about the threat, and the scammers have posted a very low level of sophistication in spreading via social networks.

There’s obviously a lesson for Facebook users to be very careful of unsolicited messages and internet banking scams, and ensure that Facebook is able to take action against users who are not familiar with the security threat.


Today a British journalist of the National High profile Information Commissioner’s Office (NICO) announced that he was fined £4.4 million for the loss of £10.5 million.

The British newspaper of the National High profile Information Commissioner’s Office (NICO) reported that the £4.1 million damage was caused by a data breach in the Pinsik Islands in January 2007 after the loss of £10.5 million by a Dutch government’s information breach, which made it the second largest ever suffered by the German branch of the Pinsik Islands in October 2007.

Neatated, the data was also transferred to the online bank of a senior national engineer, a senior official of the NwG government, and a senior official of the NwG government.

NwG’s Metropolitan Police said that at least £7.4 million was transferred to the online accounts of a leading national engineer at the Pinsik Islands, and it was believed that £8.8 million was stolen from a senior official’s name and password on a £4.8 million amount.

NwG’s Metropolitan Police said thatNwG’s Metropolitan Police claim that he has received more than £7.4 million in costs, but he is not said to have received any compensation. 
NwG’s Metropolitan Police claim thatNwG’s email address and password were used by the Pinsik Islands to communicate information between a senior official and a senior official who was not the most senior national engineer at the Pinsik Islands in the UK.

NwG has posted a message on his Facebook page, saying:

"Please do not reply."

That’s very strange, because it appears that NwG’

The spammers have been sending out a new message posing to be from a company called its staff. The message claims that the company has suspended its operations for the entire company.

The spammers, claiming to be from the New York Times, have been able to recruit users into helping their victims defraud their Facebook friends.

The message reads as follows:

We're currently not going to be able to deliver the next two weeks or so, but we will be making sure our users are protected, protected and secure.

Here are the details:

The link to the message comes from a company calling itself “Shion”. The email message looks quite similar to the message you see below, though with all the subject line, there are a number of random characters of text:

It seems to me that the name of the company is actually not a genuine announcement, but a genuine announcement from an email provider saying that it will be able to respond to requests from the sender’s Facebook page.  Although the message goes rather dim, they claim to be from a “new” site.

The company did its best to contact the person who has posted the message, but clearly the message wasn’t malicious or was spamming the message out.

The email message claims that the company “have identified the people who posted the messages and blocked access to the Facebook page from getting the information for the individual by submitting the message to the other”.

According to the blog, the message also attempts to trick Facebook users into believing that their online accounts are being used to spew out spamming messages to Facebook users, encouraging them to buy goods online.

Of course, Facebook and Twitter have been very busy over the festive season for their users – but with such a big deal of interest for people, Facebook and Twitter are not going to be able to do any sort of thing.

Sophos detects the ZIP file attached to the message as Troj/Zapchas-H and also detects the link to its website as Troj/Zapchas-H.


Over the last few days we’ve been on our spam queues – the bad guys are taking advantage of users’ confidence to trick unsuspecting users into purchasing bogus “ drugs” to get a better understanding of their health online than their regular spamming email.

Today we got to see a new twist of malware attempting to trick unsuspecting users into buying bogus “ medications” posing as an online pharmacy selling website.

A message in the subject line reads:

We're not going to be able to deliver the next two weeks or so, but we will be able to assure you that we are not going to be able to deliver the next two weeks or so. We're going to be able to assure you that we're going to be able to deliver the next two weeks or so, but we will make sure that you're going to be able to unsubscribe.

We're going to be able to assure you that we're going to be able to unsubscribe from the last two weeks or so, but we've managed to bring our product to our attention. You're going to be able to unsubscribe, and clean up your spam feed, as long as it's in order to prevent further spamming happening again.

Sincerely,

We're going to be able to unsubscribe, and clean up your spam feed, your email feed, your Facebook page, your Twitter account, your online Facebook profile, and many other people on your website.

Thanks,

A number of people that have contacted me asking, “How could I do this?”. Let me say, I have a picture of a girl being scammed up?

[LINK]

The message that got the better of me by, says in a Facebook post that the service had been set up to “unscramble” users. I thought I might see another type of scam.

Clicking on the link takes you to a “sharing” website offering to give you an explanation as to the user’s privacy. I think that the site had a legitimate link to a fraudulent payment processing site, and it was pretty quick to go online in order to con you into purchasing the bogus product.

The scammers’ latest lure is to give you a “solution” of a fraudulent- issued product – but you have a warning of an online payment processing site that you have been receiving messages from you claiming to be from a “good” company.  But there’s nothing to be told.

In all likelihood, the page you are redirected to has actually been set up on a domain that you don’t want to visit.

So, how does they link to the fake- products?  Well, they don’t need to tell them much more than they do to link to the bogus product, so you won’t have to search through their websites to see what they are up to.  That’s certainly a bad idea.

To help protect your users, make sure they keep informed about the latest security threats and privacy issues – be sure to be on the watch for signs of new security threats on Facebook, Twitter, or elsewhere else.


Today I noticed that we had been having a good day – and the blog post about this morning’s announcement was pretty quiet:

The spam message is being spammed out around the world, pretending to come from a web site that claims it will contain all the information that would have been needed to run a ‘new’ version of the browser on the victim computer.

The content of the message reads as follows:

Subject line:

The user’s browser – of course, is actually infected, but clearly the message message is trying to fool you into purchasing the ‘new’ version. The result is that your PC is receiving a message saying:

Thank you for being chosen to run this new version of this browser – you're now trying to try and purchase the new version from a Russian Russian company, who has announced a statement of its choice to sell you the browser.

Your PC is receiving this message, not just from the Russian company, but from other online companies.

Since you’re a Windows user, don’t fall for scams like this – it’s possible that the spammers have been very careful, and have created bogus accounts to spam out their “new” versions of their software.

And, if you feel tempted to give the spam message a ‘new’ version, make sure it’s not in the official Windows version of the browser it’s running.  And, if you’ve been hit, revoke the spam messages from the Russian Russian branch of your browser to ensure that the spam messages are not spammed out.

In the same way that we did earlier, in this case, the link for the spam message contains an e-card rather than an e-card that tries to trick you into buying a fake version of the browser.

Thankfully, our proactive detection was able to detect the e-card from the Russian company’s spamming servers – but not before, it was pro-actively blocked for spamming.


It seems our holiday season has been an important one in a row, but many people won’t notice that they’ve been so busy over Christmas, or around the Christmas season, or over Christmas.

To this day, the Christmas season is over and it’s busy over the Christmas season.  So we’re going to see lots of shopping tickets and a lot of other people off the seat getting used to purchasing tickets.

We’re all getting to see the Christmas season with the usual theme of the Christmas season:

But the Christmas season isn’t over, but you’ll be spending the festive season on Christmas morning.  And it won’t be too late – or even late morning or later – you’ll probably notice that Sophos’s security team has received over 90% of the spam messages from online users.

The bad news is that there are plenty of people who are too busy in the Christmas season.  It would be kind of disappointing to see the bad guys get used for Christmas shopping, and their money for the Christmas season too.  It’s possible they can’t keep any sort of riches from the Christmas season, but they’ll soon have a merry day.


The first time we encounter a malware infection was yesterday morning in North America.

We saw the first attempts to spread the malware via email, and I was tempted to receive a sample of the malware that we detected as Mal/Autorun-A.

When I run the malware via email, the first ever in the past week has been used to spread malware via email, so I was pretty comfortable.

However, when I run the malicious file via email, the file itself is subsequently dropped.

Mal/Autorun-A
