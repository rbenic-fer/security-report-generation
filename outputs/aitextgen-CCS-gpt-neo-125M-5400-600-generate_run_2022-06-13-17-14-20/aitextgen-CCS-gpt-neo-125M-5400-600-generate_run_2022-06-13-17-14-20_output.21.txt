It’s a shame that many people wouldn’t be so nervous about what their plans for a malware infection, and how they’d been in their way of spreading it.

The bad news is that if you weren’t running this, you should also run it.  Because the ‘True to life’ is a bit of a problem that’s much more likely to come.


Over a last month I blogged about malware being spread via spam messages. It is a very common sort of spam that has been spammed out, or by tricking people into buying bogus products.

This morning I noticed a very strange trick:

The name of the email spam messages is similar to the one sent out over the Christmas period, and these spams can be used to spread spam from people they don’t know.


The malware authors have created some new tools to trick users into buying fake anti-virus products.

One of the first tools we have encountered today was a Trojan:

The first thing to visit is the link to a bogus software update to ‘get infected.html’ and then automatically update the installation file that it wishes to install.

Of course, not a 100% reliable idea, and the file details can be forged from the file you downloaded the software via their web site.


This morning, the website of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had received a message informing them that their site had been compromised.

This particular Trojan, called “Fddi” in the style of ‘Fddi”, is being distributed via some form of social engineering.

The message claims to be an archive of “Fddi” and the file is a copy of the malware.

Of course, it has never been able to download it from a website, and this time it’s “detected, proactively and safely”.

The link points to a website that has been compromised, so the website may be connected with one of the bad guys.


In the past week we have been seeing a widespread campaign of emails containing malicious software attempting to infect unsuspecting users. We do not have any details as to how the hackers gained access to the website, but they have done some very bad things:

As mentioned by the following email message, the link to a fraudulent software update is:

Fddi received a tip that was sent to a number of Facebook friends that he believed the hackers had gained access to their personal information.

The message message is similar to the one used to send emails to Facebook when it was sent to the website.

Of course, as with many malware attacks, some of the attacks were not just targeted to a number of innocent users.

If you are a user of Facebook you should exercise extreme caution before any action is taken.  We are not recommending that Facebook users visit their website via the above listed link.


Today we published an advisory about a ‘new’ spam campaign which has been seen in recent months.

Today the first part of a growing number of messages have been sent via your friends’ website.

All of them have had their email addresses changed, but they aren’t.

It would seem that most people would fall for an email to try and spamming out messages like this:

I know that the people I am, and I know that the people I get on email should think before having made a message like this.


If your Twitter account has been compromised by malware, it would appear that Twitter is taking too long – in this case, they have posted something.

The problem seems to have been with Twitter’s reputation and it seems it’s time for the next Twitter to update its status of ‘viral status’.

Today the next Twitter update is now available. It should be easy to imagine how much spam has spammed out over the Christmas period, and how many people are tweeting messages claiming that their Twitter account has been compromised.

It should be easy to see how many users will fall for scams like this.  The first thing to see is that it’s not just Twitter users who have been hit by malware, it also means that a lot of users may have fallen foul of malware.

A message like this has been posted on Twitter that’s being spammed out, exploiting a number of different accounts on Twitter.

As you’ll see on the messages posted on Twitter today, the first part of this email is a link to a porn site called NoScript.  It’s easy to see why many people would fall foul of the message – rather than have just posted a message on a website which may have been compromised.


Over the last few weeks I have been able to find the exact location of a file at a location in Austria where some of the compromised accounts have been compromised.

The second part of this spam campaign is the ‘fddie’.  It appears that at least one of the hacked accounts was replaced by a link which contained a link to a video game of ‘the ‘Dancing Love‘.

That’s all very well.  It’s hard to believe that the spammer behind this site has gotten so far from finding the location on the site.

Even if they have posted a message to the infected site they still haven’t been able to find the true location of the file that’s hosted on the site – in the case of this particular spammer, they might be able to determine where.

Unfortunately, as a result of the attack on the site of NoScript, there’s no telling that the site has been compromised by malware.  But there’s still the question of where the bad guys have placed their foot – or in this case the IP address used for sending them has been compromised.

That’s certainly a good time to double-check your facts with the best practices in place to keep things going.


In the last few hours I have been looking at some of the spam messages being sent from Facebook.  Here’s a quick YouTube video I made on the subject:

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

If you do click on one of the link, chances are that you are clicking on the link from the “Like” box.  It’s clear that the page does not indicate that you are having been signed-up for Facebook, meaning that if you click on the link you are ultimately not being asked to enter your password.

What’s interesting to me is that Facebook doesn’t link to a Facebook page – and they do not use any real-time-time-update tools to block the links.

You should really exercise extreme caution before sharing unsolicited messages via email.  I hope that we will have more effort in our way to help stop people from clicking on links that appear to come from Facebook than to click on a bogus video player.


Earlier this week it seemed a bit late and now I’ve seen lots of Facebook spam messages, apparently from a number of rogue Facebook applications.

In a typical case I was taken to a Google chat site with a few friends that I have never even actually met – so I’ve also seen them with a lot of others who have been ‘spammed out’ by others in a way of posing as their friends and friends – including those that I’m really enormously grateful that there’s a lot of folks out there who are very comfortable with Facebook!


Many of the people who are out of the office are probably not really good at their computer security, but that may have helped raise awareness amongst their employees is very bad news for them.

According to the BBC News website, hackers have planted spam messages claiming to come from the “Widespread In”, a “Love Bank”, and a “Spammers” who have been arrested in the country, have used their site to con them into promoting spam.

It’s possible that the hackers are taking advantage of the people who are in the office at this point – although they have been arrested in the past.

If you visit the sites you would find many more people (some of whom are of the education group) who have been arrested in the country have been ordered to pay $99 each, or at least $40 a day to spend,000,000.

And you could argue that there’s an interesting lesson for all of us – if you are not a member of Facebook, be a member.

If you haven’t already done so, visit the web site of the German Data Protection agency, where you have Facebook available, and it’s recommended that you update your profile via email to remind them that your Facebook profile can be used to share photographs with others via the email folder.

To find out how the scammers have managed to steal information via Facebook, search the

Clearly that is where you will actually find out more – and for more information on the “one of the few” reasons behind making the point you would have found a problem. (At least the first question to answer is “The number of packets and hours will be so low then it will be the largest of the entire country of the world”).

Perhaps the best reason to ignore this question is to consider the length of the problem. Even if the answer was “Foto for two minutes”, the number of bytes will be only slightly bigger than the last four days, as it will likely be less than five.

You could think of having several randomly-chosen randomly-chosen random-looking random-looking random data with random-looking random numbers (as mentioned in the above examples).

But I do not believe that using random-looking random numbers, which I have done over the past few months, will lead to a higher degree of false positives.

It was clear that there is one more lesson to be learned from the experts of the experts of the experts, and remember to understand that the experts who work with are experts in the security of their users.


As ever the biggest virus, of course, which has its payload, Troj/Spy-Fam, will use it to evade anti-virus and infect the computer it infects.

The first thing to remember is that this one can’t just be the first virus ever to encounter a malicious payload.  It can also be the last “one of the two”.


This morning I saw something strange in a spam message that I’ve been meaning to share with you – although I was the only one.

Today, while the message arrived I saw an interesting new twist in the body.

This one reads as follows:

Here are some of the other examples I saw in the spam message, with some of the ‘fake anti-virus’ subject lines:

A:

The message contains a link to an IP address of the infected computer, where it will be detected as Troj/Spy-Fam.

A:

This message contains random text that will change on the infected computer’s IP address to the IP address of the infected computer, and if you do not access the computer you will not be able to access the computer that’s under the control of the infected computer.

B:

The message has a random text that is in the same IP address of the infected computer, but I am sure that that’s not the case.

The message, I am sure, asks me to visit the URL listed in the message.  That’s an IP number I know I’ve been using for quite some time, so I do not use the actual IP numbers I’ve used for sending spam.

A:

The text body contains random text that I thought I might not like the most, though I know that the message does not come from a particular IP address.  Maybe the message will be different if it changes to a particular IP address in the message, or has random text, or changes to the IP address of the infected computer.

B:

The link between the two messages is interesting:

A:

It looks like the message may be in a particular IP address – I have entered the IP address of the infected computer.

That’s a pretty unlikely response to the fact that the message arrived on January 25th (and later) on January 9th.

B:

As you can see, the text contents are a bit more complex than the other message.  So, with the new messages removed, or just the text content of the email, there was a link to the IP address of the infected computer to some other IP address.  Maybe the message is related to an IP address of the infected computer.

That’s just some of the reasons for the message being taken over.

For instance, the spam messages in the message get sent as “From:

This email is from the ‘Spy’ e-mail address:

The message is “Spy” in a fashion that’s similar to the “Spy” e-mail address:

Spy’s messages can’t be from a legitimate e-mail address, but rather more likely the same IP address.  After all, it looks like the same IP address, but with multiple spam messages appearing on different domains (i.e. from different IPs, the email addresses of different email addresses are not identical).

In other words, spammers are exploiting the IP address of a computer infected with Mal/Spy-Fam, so that if your computer has the following version of the infected computer you may be at risk.

B:

Clearly all spam is in a similar fashion – in some cases, they could be from a legitimate e-mail address – as the email contains random text.  Maybe the spammers are busy at other times of the day trying to lure people into taking the malicious link from their own computer to infect their computers.


Over the last few weeks we have seen lots of new malicious attachments that have been spammed out by malware authors.

SophosLabs have published detection for them as Mal/Spy-Fam-A.

Today SophosLabs received a number of new threats (including the Pushdo/Spy-Fam attack) and a number of new malware.

The threat landscape for May and June 2008

The latest threat has been discussed in SophosLabs with the largest threat in the world (32/FileMod-B).

This morning the spam campaign is being seen. The spam being used in the malware’s malware distribution and used as a ‘kind’ to make an overall sense of how bad Troj/Spy-Fam-A is.


SophosLabs have received another new spam campaign we have received since January (click here for more information about the subject).

It appears that there was quite a bit of press recently regarding the increased number of new spamming campaigns which spam on users’ computers.

To give a false sense of the content of this message, I must admit I just didn’t believe that the new spam is “infected”.

The old spammers of those who had been on their Christmas days are now using “spamming” instead of “spamming”. I was not as surprised as I thought it was.

If you do receive spam, make sure that the old spammers know that this campaign is still active, and that their old spam messages are well-managed, as many of them are designed to fool unsuspecting users.


With a little more effort I have received a few spammers over the last few days, I laptop I’m off to this blog and I will be back again.

I know that you’ve done some bad things for those of us, but the most interesting of them is to give the email address to a randomly-chosen address.

To make a legitimate spam message, let’s not just run a pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-

Clicking on the link, it would take you to a website containing the source code. A website hosted in Russia, such as a.co.uk site, would allow your browser to access files in Russia, for example in the background as a domain ending in Russia. However, in my case, the domain that was blocked by Sophos (Troj/Spyme-R) was blocked at this point.

I also wrote a story to say, “It’s no surprise to see fake anti-virus messages, even if they come from Russian government-related websites.” But it is clear that many people in Russian are getting too comfortable. The fact is that it’s still possible that the spammers are hoping to make money from stealing victims, perhaps in the hope of tricking recipients into believing they’re in Russian.


It’s announced today that it will release a major security update to the software responsible for managing the security of your company’s email client.

No details can be found in this blog but the update will be available soon.

What’s more, it’s not known which patches are available from which point on.  The company will be able to update the patches and roll them out in order to make them available for more high profile companies.


Hot on the heels of a great week in the UK I wrote a piece of code from the SANS Internet Storm Center to encourage you to be more careful about your email account and your security.

To help protect your company email client with security patches from the SANS Internet Storm Center, download our technical paper “Securing websites”.


Today I was in the office for a talk related to the SANS Institute of Technology in UK.

The talk contained a rather lively piece of malware designed to steal the security of the SANS Internet Storm Center, it used by SANS experts to help track down the security flaws that had been discovered and how the security of the SANS Internet Storm Center should be updated.

The reason the talk was covered was that SANS makes two papers for those interested. I am a proud of the focus on the SANS Institute of Technology and its work for the consumer’s self-service.

SophosLabs have published a brief podcast where you can learn more about the SANS Internet Storm Center’s efforts and what is the problem. The podcast is available here, and I have a couple of minutes to discuss what we are seeing, why computer users should be careful about security threats, and why backdoors should be taken up in the future.

The programme is available as a podcast in the podcast RSS feed ( subscribe to the podcast later) or via iTunes.


SophosLabs has encountered two new variants of the W32/Autorun-N and the W32/Autorun-N worms in different languages, and the other W32/Autorun-N is both variants.

Mal/Autorun-N is a common family of worms that are used to spread between innocent users, so we’ll continue to monitor this area for Mal/Autorun-N and the W32/Autorun-N infection as we have been mentioned before [1].

What’s interesting to me is that the worm W32/Autorun-N does not appear to be malware, as a way of making its way to remote, compromised computers and, potentially to spread to other victims.

It appears to be that the code does not affect the main PDA2 malware, but instead attempts to infect Windows with the W32/Autorun-N infection which Sophos detects as Mal/Autorun-N.

The W32/Autorun-N infection does get installed on the infected computer when the system is updated. This is the first time we have seen Sender/Autorun-N on the workstation.

We do not know if the worm W32/Autorun-N was successful or not the virus, but if so, we would not be able to confirm that it was the workstation.


We’ve got a nasty surprise in your ears this week, this time being an email from a senior security researcher.

SophosLabs received a new wave of malware today in email, using the subject line “Ctlana” and subject line “It’s a new year to email you”.

The emails, which are all intended to trick recipients into opening the attached file, look like this:

In your email, the sender claims to be an old-fashioned, and don’t ask you for any personal information.

The email claims that you’re a member of the “Comsday” family of security researchers.  So you’ll notice that the message goes as follows:

A link in the email is attached to the message.  What’s more, the sender will be directed to a webpage on the subject line, where you are prompted to enter your password.

The body of the email looks like this:

A Trojan from a senior security researcher is not dead – and a phishing is possible.  So, although the message is in the main body of the email, the spam message presents itself as an attachment.

It looks like this:

The body of the email contains the following subject lines:

We’ve seen some emails written in the past which subject lines are used.

One of the subject lines that get the most used is “The New Year”.  If you don’t, the message reads:

It’s time to let the end of the year, in the way we are happy to put the end of the year with the rest of us.

Let us know if you think that it’s time to let us know.


A US District Court in Maryland has thrown more than 40 million users’ PCs worldwide, and charges have been made against them, including the owners of the US Army, military, and the various government and company partners.

According to the court, the charges are filed in March, and it appears that the action was never taken.

Of course, the trial is scheduled to be released later this year.  But, as a result, a number of people in the US have been left to receive a lot of cold calls about their home computers, or having their computers recruited as a service.

According to a report in the Associated Press, the trial may take place tomorrow.

That’s just a start, after all, as the case has gone ahead and it will be interesting if the next court finds a suitable sentence.

But the more the potential courts claim, the next sentence could be just as much bigger than a sentence of up to ten years in prison, or for just under five years of damage to their computers.


As a result of a new OS X malware attack we published earlier this week, there were more malware today than yesterday – this time with the release of a new Windows program (Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac OS X.

Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac OS X has also been published in a couple of the latest updates to OSX.

OSX was released on October 8th, 2008, and on October 9th, 2008, as OSX.NET (Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac OS X.NET) provides protection against it. It provides protection against the W32/Autorun-N and its associated code – as it is designed to run, SAV uses an autorun driver to launch it.

OSX was released on October 28th, 2008, and users have had to wait a bit.  Oh, and as you can see in the video below, SAV has issued a new anti-virus for the old SAV that we published earlier this week.

On October 24th, 2009, Sophos published an update which was published tomorrow (detected as Troj/Autorun-N).  It’s worth a read if you haven’t already started, and has some good reason for you to be suspicious.

And, thanks to the usual changes here, OSX was released by Adobe over the Christmas period.  On October 11th, 2009, Adobe released its regular security update – which made it clear the operating system had been updated to protect against malware, and was not running the latest version of OSX.

It’s possible, of course, that malware will be distributed via a web email campaign email attack (a bit of web email is another word), and the hackers are using it to infect victims’ computers.

So, what’s to say, if you haven’t already learnt the hard way to download the security updates from the SophosLabs YouTube channel?  There’s nothing wrong with the anti-virus product.  But, what could have happened at the moment was that you’re not running up-to-date anti-

The rootkit for the compromised web server was described as Troj/ObfJS-HN. The rootkit contained the details of the malicious site, and several additional details were included. The relevant version is: Troj/Agent-QB1.

The rootkit for the compromised web server was detected as Troj/PWS-R. The rootkit contained the details of the compromised web server, and several file files to which the infected file had been compromised. The rootkit was detected as Troj/Autorun-A. The rootkit also contained the full list of malware known to the user as Mal/Iframe-C.

The rootkit used in the attacks was detected as Troj/Bvo-E.

The rootkit was detected as Troj/Dloadr-A.

The rootkit was detected as Troj/Autorun-A.

The rootkit was detected as Troj/Unif-BHN. When I tried the detection, the rootkit was detected as Troj/Unif-BN.

The rootkit was detected as Troj/Unif-BN. It was also detected as Troj/Unif-BN. It was seen that in the wild I was seeing an activity that was detected as Mal/PWS-A. The rootkit was detected as Mal/Bvo-E in the wild and was detected as Troj/Unif-M.

As soon as the rootkit was detected, the rootkit was detected as Troj/Unif-E in the fake scan. It also received detectives from the ‘Sophos Anti-Virus’, so if the rootkit were detected as Mal/PWS-A, it would have been blocked as Mal/PWS-A.


A federal grand jury has arrested a man in connection with the DDoS attack against a US hospital in Maryland, and charges have been proven.

The hackers in Illinois have been accused of using the DDoS attack against the website of a US medical firm.

The FBI has announced that the US hospital has temporarily halted the attacks in California – which could allow the authorities to investigate, and hopefully a jury in Maryland heard the evidence for the charges brought against the man.

According to the Department of Justice, a second man has been jailed for two years.

The US District Court has agreed that it should take up to an initial hearing in Turin, Virginia, on October 25th, 2012.

The Department of Justice has released a statement to those who are accused of being the victims of DDoS attacks:

"The Department of Justice will look at the full details of all charges brought against the suspects as they are not due to a sentence of up to ten years and a fine of up to 10 years in prison."

Let us hope that some of those arrested by the charges will be able to make up the evidence against those accused.

Further investigation will be published soon, which may mean hearing if an additional trial has been received.


There are plenty of people who will be having their hands up to the hackers.  We are sure that that’s exactly what happened when we ran a free-to-download “Free Download” email address.

You can see that the hackers had already gotten into the habit of opening the attached file, but today the hackers changed the email address.

The hackers were able to get the email address they would have received by sending an email email to the hackers.  But we would be all too unlikely, as that would have been for them to do a better job.

What’s particularly gallacious is that it is possible that cybercriminals were using the free email address to send spam to internet users.

Of course, we can’t be sure as we can all know exactly how successful this was, but we can imagine that more cybercriminals would be using a free email address that could be used to infect innocent users with their free email address.


It may be time for a little Christmas shopping – but what else could it be that you haven’t already received an email from an unknown address.

We were very pleased to receive an email from a colleague yesterday regarding a credit card for a member of our team of “Anonymous” members, which, for a living, would have come to our attention.

It is unclear how the spam messages were distributed via the DDoS network, so we’d had a great day of shopping, but we were pleased to find that the address for the person, not the email address the spammer is at, was not at all possible.

Our email address has been used by cybercriminals to recruit a network of people into the attack.

Our investigation indicates that the “Anonymous” claims to be the members of the DDoS group.

We’ll release a statement tomorrow titled:

There is no indication that the spam messages were sent via this DDoS site. A statement issued by the team in Turin Police underlines that the “Anonymous” had “thousands of users” and had a “huge impact on the damage caused by the attack”.

The following video demonstrates the case.

SophosLabs analysts have been monitoring a growing tide of computer spam and malware for some time today.

Today a very large spam message (also known as a ‘leak’) was spammed out in a way that we don’t have seen before:

The message has all the subject lines of the same, or rather similar, subject line:

The message body uses the subject line of the message – it says that the message body contains details like the title, the date of the post, the post, the message, and the post message.  This is an email, and the email address listed.

The body of the message body does not contain any information – it simply doesn’t need to email you and a random message.

It could be that the spammers are just trying to get their hands on information about themselves or to steal money.  But this isn’t an official site, as the spammers have also gotten the message sent from one of the legitimate victims’ accounts.

To help people notice, here’s the video you gave last day, showing the sender’s inboxes and the text that the message body was appearing on.

Our spamtrap machines have received thousands of queries by our spammer.

Over the last few months we have received over 4,000 spam emails each day – that’s a very bad amount, at least as many of our users are being affected by a virus.

So, if you lose or lose or lose your online account in one of these scams then there is a problem for your company.

To put the message on to your computer, or to your bank, you might want to see the following, text if you lose or lose your online account in one of the other scams.

The spammers don’t really need you to lose your online accounts.  They’re not interested, and if they do lose or lose, they’ll be able to access your online accounts, post messages, and even spam emails to their friends and family – of course – their online accounts and – of the other – you to their online friends.

The best of times is to tell the spammer whether the email address listed in the messages has been sent from an unknown address.

And it’s a pretty bad thing for your company, however.

The spammers have now used the site that got your email address in order to make the malware of themselves less legitimate.  But what happens is that you lose or lose your online account by leaking your online email address into your online store.

And if you lose or lose online accounts in one of these scams then you’re going to be hit with a nasty surprise if you lose or lose.

Of course, the bad news is that if your password is not encrypted, or at least that’s not the case.


A new rogue applications exploiting the ‘leak’ feature of Facebook have been seen for various different reasons.

In one of the most popular applications, they use a combination of the two, a link to a rogue application and a message saying you have ‘entitled to view videos.”

The rogue applications look like this:

The rogue application’s name, which claims to be a Facebook “leak” in German, is a Facebook survey

In fact, Firewall detected as the Mal/Spy-B malware as Troj/Spy-A.

So, if you were to open the email you should see a message of such lengths as saying that Firewall detected the malware as the Troj/Spy-B malware attack.

And if you do not, you should ensure that no-one else has changed your passwords on your computer.  After all, you should also have checked that no-one has changed in their password to a different password on their computer.

I’m just one day off at this year’s Pob Resort conference – but all day of the week the Pobela conference is full. The largest of all, at least, is the annual Pob Pharmacy event, where an average person will be able to deliver an event such as the Wie of the United States to the tune in time for all of their work.

You can also download the podcast directly in MP3 format. This podcast was made available for posterity – if you enjoy your music you’ll be able to access throughout the podcast. You can also subscribe to the podcast online via iTunes or iTunes.


Yesterday, in a move from the USA to the United States, there were a couple of fairly swinelling presentations at the Pobela conference.  The conference was held in the United States, in the United States, Australia and the USA, as well as from the United Kingdom to the United Kingdom.

The file the remote server was allowed to connect to was the default email address.

The default email address did not include any ‘spickr’ information. The default email address was set to ‘Sophos Anti-Virus for Macs:

It was this default email address that had been used to send spam. The email address was set to ‘Wolicited mail address’.

The file the remote server was attempting to connect to was not the default email address but the two legitimate email address listed the connection from to the remote server.

The malicious file is dropped as a ‘spam’ file, preventing the malicious file from reaching the remote server.

The malicious file is being spammed out in an attempt to steal information related to the email server.  The spammed out messages from the ‘Sophos’ and the attached file is not hosted on the servers any of which might be compromised.

It is therefore not clear to me how the files were spammed out. But the cybercriminals have chosen the wrong web URL to communicate with the remote server.

In all likelihood the spammed out messages like these, as the malicious files have been removed from the web page:


If there’s something that can happen, then it should certainly be a shame on social engineering tricks for social engineering!

If you lose something or someone else lose, perhaps it will be obvious that some people have lost or stolen information. If you lose or lose a lot of people, perhaps it could be worse for everyone else to fall for an attack that tricks them into sharing their personal information with others or steal your wallet.

My advice is to make your security a matter of your own.


For the last few weeks, I’ve been a bit late for the last 4 months, so here are some of the things that stand out during.

One of those things I’ve done in the past have been security updates, and I am currently awaiting a scan to determine if your organization is infected with malware.

One of those things I haven’t done in the past have been the latest security vulnerabilities.  With a high level of care in place, having a well-known vulnerability is hard to remember and patch before rolling it out.  However, I recommend that you keep your security updated and the patches in place.


Hot on my heels this weekend, hackers stole personal information from the highly controversial “Kay virus” organisation’s offices in London, claiming to support their “Anonymous” and cyberwarfare.

According to a statement by Metropolitan Police, the hack stole information about the “Victoria”.

The investigation found evidence that the hackers stole the information on a number of victims in the event of the cyberwarfare (which has been dubbed “Operation Aurora”).

However, the newspaper reports claim that the information was stolen “via an external hacker”.

The news that the British Ministry of Energy is about to launch its annual cyber-attacks, is becoming clear and ongoing.  As we have shown before, it is clear that in the past two and a half, hackers have stolen information about the highly controversial “Victoria” and claimed that their actions were in response to the hack against the Ministry of Technology.

The report claims that the hack was caused by the theft of details related to a “leak” which was the work of a technical support team working with the Metropolitan Police.

"The Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU) is a member of the Metropolitan Police forces, responsible for computer security and the safety of the members of the law at the Police and Home Office."

The PCeU’s spokesman that it believes that the hack was caused by the mis-spelling of its website from an SQL injection attack.

"We do not believe that the information stolen by the hackers was accessible to the public."

The PCeU’s statement that it will be conducting an “Operation Egypt” investigation has been posted on the PCeU’s website.

The PCeU will be looking at the details regarding the next few days to see if it believes the cyber-warfare group has compromised their website, making it easy for hackers to steal identities and commit the attack.

"Earlier this week, we identified approximately 50,000 servers and were able to access information relating to the “Kay virus”.

There’s no such thing as a free-hack, the British government would ever do anyway, and a strong message on its website:

"We will be in the process of identifying the unauthorised actions of members of the Government when it comes to developing information about ourselves. We will monitor the security of our website, and it will be provided in a manner that could be used against our adversaries."

It isn’t clear to me whether a full disk encryption system like SQL injection would actually allow spyware to have been able to access information about a victim or not.

Of course, if the data was accessible to the outside world, it’s possible that hackers would have planted a code on the PCeU’s servers by embedding it into their code and using it to spy on victims.

Of course, if it had been done, you would be able to access a database of personal information such as bank accounts, bank account numbers, etc.  If you run a spyware program on your computer, you might well be worried about yourself, if your computer had been infected with malware or spyware – as many people will see a screen informing you that the PCeU’s servers has been accessed by the hackers – and – indeed – you would be in the running for a better sentence, if only a sentence, if only a fair sentence.

Unfortunately, it seems that hackers have now taken the necessary steps to break their old ways of hiding their true true pictures – in this case, by displaying bogus alert messages.

No personal information, of course, stored in a database of the names of a member of your friends, or in their case, lost or stolen by hackers, or stolen by identity thieves.


We’ve had a number of reports recently about an attack against the British government in which people have been bombarding their computers with fake anti-virus alerts.

The emails are of course designed to infect the computer users by spamming them out.

Many people believe they have been having an active interest in computer security in the last couple of years, whether they’re in any way involved in computer security or not.

For instance, back in 2008, when they were in the public domain after discovering a security flaw in computers and logging them back on to its original owners.

According to the Daily Times, British government officials claim that the attacks against the government are “huge” and that “hundreds of computers have been compromised”.

Of course, such as the computers which were not compromised in any way, and may have been infected by malware or spyware, the authorities claim that the attacks were “huge.”  For more information, check out the Daily Times’s website.


The Daily Times has published its annual report into cybercrime.

The UK government has published an official report from the Daily Telegraph, claiming to give people from around the world the ability to “pay” £150,000 (US$72,000) by taking on a “solutional” internet banking system.

According to a statement by the Daily Times, the government’s website and its customers’ computers were struck with malware on March 17th, and in just ten months later, compromised computers with access to personal information – including the names, email addresses, phone numbers and bank account details.

According to the Daily Times, this is just the latest investigation by the government and its staff into cybercrime in the country, which is growing in frequency from cybercrime to financial crime.

Even if you haven’t already published an investigation – be careful what you post on your computer, and remember to keep your security up-to-date.

Here are some of the top secret things we can all learn:

* Use some anti-virus signatures (for instance, Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac home users)
* Change the anti-virus product to be a kept on a live PC or computer connected to a computer (for instance, if you haven’t installed a PC before, for instance, it doesn’t mean that it’s running up-to-date anti-virus software on your PC yet, and that isn’t a real PC PC yet, there’s no real PC then.
* Use anti-virus and anti-virus software to protect against threats from unknown malware.
* Keep an eye out for updates from the latest online security threat and be sure to update your PC if it’s not.
* Keep a look at the latest online security threats and patches on your computer.
* Watch the latest computer

Unfortunately, the Firewall is still suffering from such an attack as due to the high number of web pages being compromised by cybercriminals. So far, no information on the Firewall is available as to how it can be believed that it may have been compromised, or a mis-formed page.

It could be that Firewall had been hit for more than 18 months due to a bug in the software, the Firewall has been updated to its current DNS server name.

We will continue to monitor the situation to see to protect our customers. One of the best practices would be to ensure that your firewall software is updated and a close connection can be secured, including network connections from a computer connected with the Firewall.


Some people have asked why does someone think that spam has gotten to such high? If so, it’s a very bad idea.  Because spam has been so bad, it makes sense to ask you for your personal details to your friends, family and acquaintances.

If you’ve been infected by spam, the best thing to do is to be certain your computer has a decent firewall password.  And that’s why I would never see a spam message from someone else.

And that’s why I would never fall for a phishing attack.

So, why doesn’t it give you a better email than the ones I send?

Well, many people use a strong password that’s easy to remember, but can also be used for stealing identity theft and identity theft.

Take care the message, for instance, and don’t fall for the kind of phishing it’s using at the moment:

There’s definitely been an issue of the security of the internet recently, and I’ve been very nervous that I should have a hard-to-crack password on my computer.

But that doesn’t mean I should be able to recover my identity from spams.  Here’s a suggestion: “It’s easy to remember someone who has a computer on the internet”.

And, guess what?  After all, don’t let your friends fall for such bad things.  That doesn’t mean that you should always be more suspicious about spamming.

And don’t let your friends fall for a phishing attack.  If you’ve been hit by spam and identity theft, your computer will already be vulnerable to identity theft.

Update: Read more about the phishing attempts in this article.


The spammers have been sending messages out of the blue that their spammers have spammed out on social networks all around the world.

Now, in an email message seen by SophosLabs, recipients are at risk if they are tempted to visit a website or access to a website, potentially infecting themselves with malware or phishing Troj/Spy-A.

According to a statement to their Facebook page, the messages are messages with a subject line of “We have lost your information and will not be able to restore your identity.”  SophosLabs will be reviewing the website’s “obtaining information and restore you to a clean-up disk.”

Clicking on the link takes you to a webpage which has, of course, been compromised.

If that really matters, you may as well click on the link take you to a video where the video is live.

And don’t let yourself fall for the kind of phishing they’ve seen on Facebook too.

The bad news is that Facebook users have been hit, by an attack that appears to be targeting users of Facebook Facebook, not users of Facebook.

A post on Facebook which says that users have been seeing messages from users asking the questions, reads:

“We have lost your information and will be able to restore your identity to its clean-up disk.”

It’s a pretty bad story, but I wonder how much more harm could have been done if Facebook had done something than this.  The scammers are claiming that users of Facebook have been hit by the attack, using the link as bait.

The good news is that it isn’t possible to tell whether the messages have been posted on Facebook or seen on users’ Facebook accounts.  Maybe Facebook’s Facebook page has been updated to a similar picture (via Flickr 2.0) rather than the following link:

“I was watching your video and noticed that it wasn't from Facebook! <script>”

It seems that there are a number of people watching the messages – it could be that Facebook have hit them for more, or that people were watching it too.

In the latest Sophos-related spam messages, I think that there’s something more bad news on Facebook than the people commenting on the link for the messages:

“Yours are from Facebook, we will update you on the next few days”

In other words, if you like Facebook, go right to your Facebook page to ensure that your Facebook page is kept up-to-date.  And, if you do believe you’re being hit, it’s safe to click on the link again.


The Register published its annual report on Thursday, which claims that the Internet Information Technology Authority (IICA) is the source of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against the UK’s critical infrastructure.

The Register reports that a British government spokesperson confirmed that the attacks against the British government are said to have been in operation for more than one month.

According to a statement by the IICA, the attacks against the UK’s infrastructure hit the online bank system, and the company was taken to its own knees.

It was reported that the IICA’s website was hit by a DDoS attack (detected by the BBC’s Ben Jupp in September by BBC Radio4’s Rory Cellin).

The Register reports that the group’s website has been struck offline at the time of the attack.

According to the IICA, it has taken down many of the websites that have been hit by the DDoS attack.  The Register claims that some of the sites, or the websites that are infected by the attack, have been used by hackers who have tried to launch the DDoS attack against the government.

Unfortunately, we haven’t been able to identify what was behind the DDoS attack yet.  The Register claims that some of the websites that have been hit have been struck up by the DDoS attack.

There’s a lesson here: if you run a website you need to be very careful about which sites your users visit and whether you have been compromised by this or not.

Our labs in the UK are intercepting a huge amount of email scam – just one of the largest, and the most common, attacks we see every day – in what is a pretty impressive little mass.

In the last few days we have seen a significant rise in the number of email scam email we’ve received over the past few days – in particular, we have seen a sharp rise in the number of attempts to target people with spam, and over the last few days (for example in 2009 or 2008) the number of people with an email message.

We know that the sheer number of people having a web-based email fraud emails is steadily steadily growing, and in the last few days (such as this one) the increase of the number of emails.  But there’s still a significant problem – the people who see them from these types of email accounts aren’t really from people that are in fact legitimate.  So, if you read the small print you’ll be seeing a whole mass of email messages, seemingly from people who have legitimate email accounts.

To all those who clicked on the unsolicited emails, the scammers have replaced the message body to a copy of the message, called the message, as it will be very similar to the email messages from those of people who have legitimate accounts.  (The other thing to realise is that we need a better-quality, legitimate email address to do the email job of sending the message, and the more that the email address will come from the scammers, this sort of email address is not necessarily legitimate, or which might make the email more believable.

You can understand that a spam message was sent from a Russian-based email address to a Russian-based email address, but this is very similar to the spam messages I’ve been seeing on Russian computers.

A sample of the spam messages is circulating at the moment, and the message body will not be blocked by the automated spammer – if you click on the link you are taken to a rogue application site:


Earlier today I saw an email from a Russian government of an Iranian government official:

The emails were from Russia:

This morning a malicious file called file_logic.scr is used as a hook to run the malware. This file is not detected as Mal/Zpif-E. This file is proactively detected as Troj/Zpif-E.

This is a good precaution to protect your computer. The hackers have not been using the malware for some time but in the past we have seen other malware families that can be exploited to spread the malware as a way of attack. Perhaps they will keep trying to protect their computers as this is the last step to ensure they are protected from hackers exploiting the social engineering.


Today the UK’s intelligence agency revealed that it had successfully hit a London government site.

No.

Of course it wasn’t the web server or the site that had hacked the UK government website – but the site it was based was visiting.

At the time of writing, a British government official, based in the United Kingdom, was at risk in terms of data loss.

What if the government website had been compromised by hackers?

No.

An investigation in the United Kingdom has determined that data stolen from the data from the computers in the USA was accessed and was not safe, but was also compromised by hackers.

In a statement posted to the Met Police website, the spokesperson said that it was “ routine to confirm that we are continuing to monitor access to the UK’s national security and national security.”

The hackers, who were not identified by the authorities in the United Kingdom, broke into the UK government site and planted fake information on a site that was not connected with the government site.

The hack was believed at an online hospital in Shetland, where computer equipment was stolen from an unknown source.  The investigation determined that the data was accessible from a server located at a former hospital in Shetland, the University of Reading.

According to the statement, the information was accessible from a server located in Shetland:

"The investigation in the United Kingdom is taking immediate action to protect the security of the computers and ensure that the proper encryption was in place."

However, in a statement posted to the Met Police website, the spokesperson said that it was “ constantly working to ensure the full details are not unavailable and were not compromised or compromised by hackers or others.”

This isn’t the first time that the investigation has been slow, as the authorities have been slow-breaking in the last few years.


The internet scammers, who are using poorly-chosen ‘friends’ to trick people into buying bogus products and to steal millions of dollars of dollars in a lottery, have posted a message on Facebook claiming to offer an ‘True Hazy video‘.

The message reads as follows:

I've got a full video

Of course, this isn’t a genuine YouTube video, but the scammer posted an explanation that the message had been posted on the Facebook website, presumably to trick others into taking surveys and handing over their personal information.

Here’s the message, which the scammers have posted on Facebook:

This was really shocking to see a video player, but I thought he could post a video if I wanted him to watch the video.

No video player ever gets the chance of receiving the video on the Facebook website (the scammers clearly hope for an ‘True Hazy video‘), but there is another trick in the message which attempts to trick users into taking surveys.

So, if you click on the link you are taken to a rogue Facebook page which claims you have a ‘ genuine video’.  At least it looks like the Facebook page’s genuine YouTube page, designed to trick unsuspecting users into taking surveys or handing over their personal information.

The scammer claims that he has posted images to the page’s friends Facebook page – presumably earning commission for his “fake Hazy video” scheme.  A photo of him on Facebook.

Of course, this is not yet a YouTube video, and it may seem to be connected with the Facebook scam.  Some of the scams that have posted in the past include a link to a ‘fake video‘ Facebook page – designed to trick unsuspecting people into taking surveys or handing over their mobile phone numbers.  Unfortunately, it’s possible that the scammer has uploaded a message to your Facebook page.

Of course, this isn’t the first time we have seen scammers post messages on Facebook claiming to offer an online video player – the latest one was the “I'm A Toast A Hottest” message.  Last month we saw a scammer post messages to the Facebook page’s own wall, claiming to have been from Facebook:

http://tinyurl.com/#!/NBChopes/facebook-p:// -an-fake-news-uploads- YouTube/solution/

We’ve seen similar scammer attempts spread on Facebook too.  Clearly the scammers have created fake accounts and have been slowting on their messages, trying to trick users into purchasing their “ premium rate”, or taking advantage of the online ‘clean” dialog.

If you’ve seen a message like this posted on Facebook, you might be tempted to click on the link to watch a video.


There’s one problem here here.  If you’re a software developer you have to deal with the following, the risk- increases.  So why isn’t there a better job than you?

In your own experience, we do not know what the bad guys are up to – we don’t really know what the bad guys are up to, and we don’t know what the bad guys are up to.

One of the reasons we’ve been seeing something on Naked Security lately is that there is a number of malicious hackers out there trying to exploit our security.

Some hackers are taking advantage of our zero-day vulnerability – or, as we have seen before, we’ll have to take a closer look.

And that’s why we’re all so sorry about the situation, as our users have chosen not to run malicious code via the web site, or to be instead taken more proactive.

As always, if you have a keen interest in the SophosLabs YouTube channel, please let us know, as this was not the time to roll out an up-to-date anti-virus update or a copy of the Adobe patch.

Thanks to Clu-blog reader Fraser who posted this on YouTube, and also commented on this blog.

It’s pretty certain that many hackers have tried and failed to exploit the vulnerability to get a better job.  We’ve made our own reports in the past, but many people seem to have learnt that lesson.

As we mentioned before we begin, there’s a new version of the web page that we have seen recently. The web page has been updated with the content:

The web page has updated with the content:

We’ll be back soon, as the web page changes to a more secure web page:

The web page of course has changed (as it happens, there’s a new version), but we still find the HTML content that redirects to the web page, which means it’s quite a good indication that this is really a malicious web page. The web page has also changed to a small randomised web page:

This is a very similar example of the badish site we saw yesterday:

Of course, the page of course has a similar result. The web page has been updated to this:

But if you click the “script here” tab you can also visit the web page:

The web page presents you with a webpage that looks like this:

Of course, it’s still annoying, and looks like this:

Well, a quick search at the web page reveals that this page hasn’t been set up by the scammers.

To see what’s happened, click on the “script here” tab:

Now, after viewing the “script here” tab and you’ve passed it on to the “script here” tab, it’s pretty quiet.  But it’s really annoying and tries to get the pages you’ve clicked on:

So, as you’ll see in the following video, you can make it harder for cybercriminals to exploit webpages they are interested in.

And don’t forget, if you’re interested in finding out more about how the web page works, consider doing an online search on “online”, where you can see all of the webpages visited:

Log entry found: Firewall (Type: Firewall) detected. [Allowed network traffic protocol'smtp:25' from'server74.aws.com' to 'Mail server EP'. Rule 'Internet_to_Mail_Server'.]

The IP-sharing web server had been found as ‘W32/Vigus’ in an IP address on ‘Tnet.com’, and a message was sent to a number of compromised IP addresses on the IP. All of these IP addresses were accessed by the criminals to determine the IP’s that they had been compromised.

According to a report in The Times, the hackers found a way to steal information about victims to exploit a vulnerability in the web server and gained access to ‘some’ computers in the form of malware.

The hackers also compromised the IP server and changed the DNS settings on the compromised computer, but as we can see in the screenshot of a message message seen in ‘W32/Vigus’ it is quite possible that the hackers were able to steal email addresses through compromised computers using the same IP address.

A variety of compromised PCs are being referenced in the hack, or in connection with the new ‘sp typo’ attack. These have been changed to ‘sp typo’ to “sp typo”.

The hackers will also be able to steal emails and spam data via compromised computers in connection with the hack.

We’ll keep you updates in the comments made in our knowledge base article.

PS: We have received emails in our spam feeds that suggest that the hackers are trying to steal information about users.


We have been seeing a number of recent data spillings in their email spam email messages. We saw another one of the very similar spam messages with the subject line “Barack anti-virus”.

One of the reasons why I would not open email messages on my computer is that I don’t like your password, but the people who receive emails from people I trust think that they’ve used the same password for multiple websites – which means, if you fall foul of a malware attack that I would be sure to double-check whether a site was compromised.


In the past few days we have been seeing many more “spam messages and email attachments” in our spamtraps.  For instance, today a colleague posted an email telling me that it was a scammer. He was on the same computer as me, but I was off-site because someone else had accessed my email account too.

This is a little trick – and we don’t see anything that I would have seen in the email, as I did some research. This is really the most interesting bit.


A couple of days ago we saw some of the more recent spam campaigns that have been spammed out. It seemed to be a growing number of emails with the subject line “Barack anti-virus” in one of the subject lines.

The emails looked like a typical email in the body, but the email appeared in the body as opposed to “Barack anti-virus”.

The subject line, however, contained links to different products of the product (eg 1.2G and 1.3G).

The message read “Barack anti-virus” with the subject line “Barack anti-virus”:

"Barack anti-virus"

[Message body]

Your e-mail address should have received an e-mail address in January, which is a bit unlikely.

The address I just received was a service called e-mail address.

Of course, I can’t tell you what is the “correct e-mail address”, but I would imagine it would make sense to visit a genuine website in the e-mail address of the person who received this message.  So far, the e-mail address has been spoofed by the spammers.


According to The Register, the British government has published an advisory warning of a “keypoint in the United Kingdom” to the public (for instance, the government would not be using the word “keypoint” in any other way on the internet – the GCHQ).

Here’s the statement by the British government:

"Two people have been arrested by the Metropolitan Police in connection with the widespread spamming of email addresses.

All of the messages and messages were posted on the GCHQ’s official website and on other websites by a number of people (such as the Metropolitan Police, the Metropolitan Police, and the Metropolitan Police) under suspicion of spamming.

The information posted to the GCHQ’s website was publicly available, so if you clicked on the link you are taken to a domain called a domain registered in England.

It’s unlikely that the people who uploaded photos, addresses and email addresses are in the wrong hands.  And it could be that the people that posted the photos did not include the true, legitimate name of the victims, or other name.  For instance, a list of IP addresses.

It’s unlikely that the people that posted the emails in the above video would be able to steal information which you would think was not worth more than £10,000.  In that case, a closer examination finds that the details of the “keypoint” have been posted to a legitimate website – the genuine information would have been made available via a link delivered from a malicious executable.

And now, the BBC reports that the investigation “do not believe that the information it finds is malicious”, and that it “no evidence will be found or found to confirm the claims they have received.”

But that doesn’t mean that computer users are being scammed out as spamming.  There was a very real problem in the life of computer users.  We could just as easily have a solution – but it turns out that there’s definitely nothing new to that effect.

No, nothing else – the BBC’s website was hacked.  It seemed very much out of curiousity from a fan of “just to play”, rather than from an anti-spam expert.  It was kind-of like saying “No spamming”, and it seemed clear that a genuine threat from malware was still present.

To help those of us know our facts, remember this story, and be on our guard.


It appears on September 5th that hackers are attempting to recruit more of the people we don’t know, and they’re being scammed out.

A video was published earlier today which describes how scammers are spreading the malware via email using the use of a link that claims to come from a website called www.bwalker.com.

The messages in the video claim that one of the individuals who leaked this email has leaked about $200,000, or a $200,000,000.  That’s a pretty bad scam, as it can take you to a page hosted on www.banchi.org where a “secret” link can also be used.

So it appears that the hackers are taking advantage of the lure of the email to trick the victim into opening their “secret” link in order to trick the victim into opening the attached file.

That’s the intention of the attack – or at the very least, it’s possible that the scammers are using the link for further campaign.  And the same goes for the “secret” link too.

If you click on the link from www.banchi.org, and the click on the video, the hackers have taken the opportunity to install the software from a web server on the web server – which they say they have “ uploaded”.  This would then be a very bad surprise to the scammers.

What’s interesting is, although it is no secret that scammers haven’t used the “secret” link in the email.  It’s pretty clear from the video that the hackers are using for more and more money, and have stolen personal information about the users of the site – which, they say, would give them the chance to infect the victim by making themselves a potential victim in their money-making scheme.

Some other scams seem to be getting more serious recently.  The scammer has claimed that the email message was sent to a women called Mbroot about “a child” and that the women’s name and email address were used to spy on others.

In addition, when the scammer posted photos of Mbroot’s wife, a couple of other individuals were posting messages promoting the product.  The photos included a link that was, apparently, a YouTube video.

Of course, it’s not clear to me why Mbroot’s wife, who has been arrested in Ireland, was taken to the hospital in London.  However, if the police believe that they have broken the law in the video – the video will be appearing somewhere somewhere in the hope that the photo-sharing site will have been put in place.

Hopefully the scammer’s case will be as much news for its victims – who hopefully will
