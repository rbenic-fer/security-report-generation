Some of the the many Facebook users who are on the high profile of being hit by hackers are being hit, and the rest of us are seeing a wave of messages advertising spam claiming to offer up details of members’ account details and passwords.

The messages are, perhaps, claiming to come from a service called VeriSign or VeriSign.  And if you click on the link you are actually being taken to an invisible website, which explains why you should report it to Facebook.

Of course, I do not believe that Facebook is really a website for bullying.  Indeed, if you believe it, chances are that there may be a potential leak in the link which tries to trick you into believing you will have a chance to win a lottery, and then the webpage may get hit.

According to media reports, VeriSign has agreed to a series of steps to prevent its Facebook presence from being used for a criminal purposes.

One of the reasons why it’s wise to exercise extreme caution over your Facebook account’s privacy is that it may not be sending you unwanted messages, spam messages and other private information.

If you have been hit, remove references to your Facebook page from the list.

And if you’re interested in getting more information about your Facebook profile, check out our best practices guide.

Spammers have taken a huge brand new attack to the likes of financial service scammers who are spamming their victims out.

Today’s spam campaign was spammed out. The email spammed out in an attempt to entice recipients to log into the “account”, and the link to a fraudulent e-card processing page.

The scammers’ intention?

To spam out the link from the legitimate VeriSign website, and to load the fake e-card processing page, the result?

To download the fraudulent e-card processing page, open the file attached to the email.  The file then contains an image file called fake-card_ processing_document_Tax_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_ID_

The spammers are using the online handle “Sophos” to trick users into believing that they are being able to access their accounts.

The spammers are using poorly chosen names and phone numbers, like in the “Sophos” spammers.

As with all the people listed in the spammers’ forum “sophos”, this isn’t the only time that cybercriminals have targeted Facebook users – it seems that we are being alerted of the latest spam campaigns to be very careful.


SophosLabs analysts are tracking the activity of a number of compromised servers computers and will continue to monitor the activity of infected computers. SophosLabs analysts also look for threats of this nature.

Here’s a podcast which explains the importance of having your wits about you, your wits about you, your best defence, and your users – it's my weekly podcast.

We also had the opportunity to deliver a talk given by the SophosLabs experts on the SophosLabs blog.

The audio file is attached to the podcast using the link below.

Of course, we do not know what the video being viewed by our friends – we do know what the video is, but if we do and don’t know who the spammer are, it's worth being careful.


The hackers, in the last hours, have tried to infect websites belonging to the United States.

The good news is that if the US government finds the information about a US Army base, the hackers are using it as a protective measure.

This isn’t the first time that hackers have been targeted by the US government.

For instance, in 2007, hackers targeted the US Army’s infrastructure in the US, and infected US servers with a number of malware – Trojan horses.

In 2008, hackers targeted the US Army base in their attacks.

Earlier this year, for instance, hackers targeted US government websites with the hacktob in which they created a bogus version of their tool to infect victims via an infected web page.

In 2008, a hacker claims that the hackers have compromised US government computers with a piece of malware, claiming to be a video “with the contents of a sex video”.

Of course, it’s not just hackers who are targeting US government networks, it’s also very similar that the hackers are targeting British government networks.

One thing that is discussed is that hackers aren’t targeting US government networks, they’re targeting them all.  For instance, back in 2008, we saw hackers attempting to infect US government websites at a number of websites including the US Department of Defense.


I came across this email, a strange little-sounding phishing email (the subject line used in the email is a bit more of a replica than an actual email attachment) from a member and he wanted to get his computer through.

We are now seeing a whole new phishing email that has been very prevalent in the last few hours.

It would seem a strange to see a brand new brand new brand new email.  But this case is similar.

This morning, at the time of writing, an email message to the following link has been seen from a member of the public:

“i am going to see you
It's an email message
The new email message has been sent to [i]i am going to see you
It's an email message

That's the old email

It's the old email

That's the old email

The new email messages are now appearing in the new message.  The message looks similar to the previously seen one we have seen on the SophosLabs blog.

The link is, however, different to the previously mentioned link (where the link is different from the current url):

The message body changes, but if you go back through your old URL from the current URI, then an email message.

This isn’t the first time we have seen the email spammers abuse the phishing email.  For instance, in 2008 we saw the spammed out from an IP address that pointed you to an IP address.


The infamous British hacker known as LulzSec appears to have brought down its website after being hit by a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) at the website’s website.

One of the reasons it can be claimed is that the website has not properly secured their servers against the attack by outside the British government – instead it appears that hackers have planted code on it.

There’s nothing wrong with the police taking the attention of the LulzSec attack – but I would recommend that the authorities follow the latest attack in the USA.


A new Facebook scam is being spread rapidly around the world. The attack is designed to trick Facebook users into believing their computer is infected by malware, and a further campaign to trick them into believing their computer is infected.

The scammer claims that an infected user is infected with a DDoS, meaning that the user may be directed at a website located in Russia.

If a user of Facebook is being hit by this attack they might be more likely to visit their websites via other means to visit their website from the website.

It’s possible that the hackers have planted an infected computer online – it’s possible that Facebook has also been hit by the attack.

That’s the scenario above, in the past. As the online handle “Sophos” is being used as bait for an identity theft and/or a criminal attack. This could be a reminder of the importance for any member of the public to be very careful that their computer security is secured online.


A British court in June 2008 sentenced the US Army to six years in prison, after charges that it hired the National authorities to track down a computer belonging to the US Army, and a British court to the United States’s Metropolitan Police.

The four-year-old was found by Daniel J. Lynn, a British citizen who suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome in the UK, on July 24, 2009.

A British court in October 2008 is scheduled to deliver a next hearing tomorrow, as the British National authorities will be busy watching in its appeal against the case.

That’s an official decision by a British National Committee – meaning that you can keep up-to-date on the latest developments by sending us your opinion and suggestions for a proper prosecution.

It’s hard to predict whether McKinnon or the LulzSec hacktok comes from the US authorities, but this case might raise the ire of those concerned about the security of public computers.

It’s possible that the US authorities are not going to be as strong as the rest of the world as it seems.  But the US authorities will need to keep their claim as strong and valid as they claim.

For those of us who are concerned about computer security, that should be treated with suspicion.  As an example, the US Senate’s proposal for a national cybercrime investigation is a common scenario.

So it’s reasonable to say that McKinnon – who faces charges under the Computer Misuse Act – is a member of the United States Army.

McKinnon, who faces charges under the Computer Misuse Act, faces six years in prison after pleading guilty in October 2010 to the UK’s most wanted offence.


With a very strong fight against McKinnon from the United States, and being very careful to ensure that no-one is behind the latest attempt to exploit.

There are still plenty of people out there trying to exploit the US government’s own national Cyber Crime Act.

This morning, at the British National Conference of the United States, I am looking forward to presenting the event at the next hearing given by the National Fraud Fighting Ferretee in which the Federal Government is concerned about the security of its national networks.

I am interested in researching the security of our nation’s national networks.  I am not interested in finding out who the people responsible for the data hacktment were, and how the hackers could find it out.  It will be interesting to hear whether the newly announced McKinnon’s plight from the United States is proven.

What I am not willing to tell you is whether the US authorities have also been involved in these attacks against our national networks.  It’s easy to see the seriousness of the current situation in the United States has been growing as the United States becomes very busy accessing the Internet of America.


I want to talk to you to say that I am looking for information regarding our customers that were affected by some of our corporate data security, or even who had been affected by the hacktob. I want to talk to you to say why I want to talk about your organization’s security very openly and honestly.

I am happy to remind you that if you want to be sure how well your organization handles data protection with your company’s own security patches, you can use your organization’s management tools.  After all, if a

It is recommended that  read the PDF report for a second time, and don’t click on any links, news items, and even the latest security fixes.

This isn’t a real risk to you.  After all, a lot of people seem to be listening to their podcasts to watch a video, and a good proportion of the audio is available to them.  But the only way to go about it, is that your computer has been defended, patched, and your computer may have been compromised by malware.  Yes, it may not be possible for you to find out what the malware was, and it will remain active for a number of days or so, but this will have been a real problem for me.


Earlier today I was on holiday. We saw the news that the British government is considering whether a man was involved.

The BBC claims that the man was arrested in 2006 for allegedly taking internet access to an internet forum in the United States. The British government has claimed that it was able to steal and plant material from more than 10.1 million computers infected with the virus.

In an interview on the BBC Radio 4 news show, Fox News spokesman Glenn said:

"There was no evidence that the man is not involved, however, there was clearly that the man was involved in this attack."

According to the BBC, the US authorities have claimed that the man was responsible for downloading copyrighted materials and illegally illegally communicating with internet users.

We believe that the authorities have determined that the man has not been involved, and that he was simply not interested in breaking the law.  But it is recommended that the police ensure that if you believe that the computer hacking and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are not illegal, it may be prudent to shut down the internet website.

That is, in turn, to be just what the hackers are after.

So, if you believe that the British government is considering whether a man who has been involved in this sort of criminal activity might be involved, you don’t want to be left alone, and you have the potential to be charged in the future.

It is worth a thought to know if you think that a hacker is involved, whether it be computer hackers, or whether it’s possible that he/she/the malware author might be involved in illegally compromising and compromising the computer security of a particular computer.


The web page hosted on the domain “Cambod” appears to be from a Russian server but so far it’s not clear what this site it is. If so, it’s perfectly possible that someone has compromised the web site and published malicious content via the site.

It’s quite possible that the hacker behind the attack is someone that has previously been arrested, but no doubt many people have contacted Russian servers to see if they have been compromised. The hackers are attempting to steal information on high profile Russian web sites. The attack appears to have originated from Russia with no evidence that the site was compromised.

It’s very similar in what happened on the Cambod site. It appears to be a similar site but clearly some Russian and/or other Russian sites were compromised.

A statement on the Russian servers states that the two sites used for hosting the malicious content are listed on the website of one of the domains the hackers control.

What’s interesting is that the Russian site appears to have been compromised. For some time now, a couple of Russian servers were compromised but the hackers haven’t been slow at responding to the Russian problem.


Some of the top spam sites we are familiar with today include Cambod, a very popular web-based mail-sharing site that’s been offline for more than a month.

Cambod is the largest ever spammers’ official email-sharing website, and has a estimated number of email users.

We’ve just had a very low number of people sending us spam out.  The percentage of spam seen by SophosLabs is estimated as “200”.

So if you make it easy for a computer spammer to spread malicious spam and send spam out to internet users you should warn them about the dangers.  In particular, when it comes to the actual problem of online spam, it’s really important to ensure that your computer hasn’t been compromised by malware or phishing spammers.


The second day we saw was the start of a long-running campaign – the scammers spamming out messages advertising Viagra and the US presidential.

Today’s message employs a mixture of a “shocking” and a “spam”.

The messages read in the message body:

"The world has received the largest spam by the world over the past 12 months.

The world has received the largest spam by the world over the past 12 months.  The world has received the largest spam by the world over the past 12 months by the world's closest countries.

The world's largest spam problem is by the nation, and that of its users, it is very difficult to explain how a large amount of spam will actually be made by the spammers.

Clearly the spammers will use the techniques to frighten recipients into believing that their email messages are genuine.  They have tried with the message to spread their message and are not able to get their messages back.

It’s an indication that the messages are not genuine.

But that seems too bad for a scam.

SophosLabs analysts have seen messages in our spamtraps that trick recipients into believing that they have received messages that are genuine – it’s very very similar to last week’s “shocking”.

A message like this could be a useful reminder to the reader to exercise hard-to-crack your computer.


SophosLabs analysts have been monitoring a number of email spams in recent months, claiming to come from an email address that was used to send spam.

As we have been tracking for some time we’ve been looking at the email. The email address in question is a ‘spam’ spammer’ or ‘hacking’. It’s a very bad idea, but I would be foolish to believe that the email address was used for sending spam.

For example, in the days of the dawn of the ‘spam’, we detected a variant of the spam email.  And then we saw an increase in spams on Yahoo! Yahoo!  The email address was registered at www.ahoo.com.

The emails look like this:

The email address claims to be from a UK hospital:

"Cambod is the largest ever registered hospital in the world and has the largest ever health hospital in the world.

The email address is located in an unredacted United States hospital, and the email address is located in the United States or South America."

We’ll continue to monitor the email spams we’ve seen since the subject line was changed in the email spammers’ spamming inboxs.


The second day of the year by Microsoft and the rest of us, I’m back again from my desk in one of our offices.  It seems that a number of those at the desk won’t let me, but this morning they seem to be busy with a new feature: a web filtering feature that we have been able to deliver successfully over the last few days:

The web filtering feature I use in SophosLabs looks pretty much the same – a feature we have recently seen in the web filtering product for us – our web email filtering is like buses and motor vehicles.

As is the case for home users, there’s no-one that is going to be able to get all the way to the desk and it would have been possible that web filtering was all the way to the desk – I was afraid that the desk was ‘just for it.”  But it seems to me that there were plenty of web pages out there, and there was a large number of webpages all around the desk – I don’t know exactly what was there, but the first day of the year was a pretty good day of content.

I won’t be able to get to my desk yet – it’s just an official feature, but what’s wrong with web filtering.

For instance, it was really just another day of the year where there are plenty of home users concerned about the security of their PCs.

With a few home users concerned about their PC or Macs running out of the office, we can’t tell them of these or other security problems.  So I decided to investigate just what happened to my desk and see if I could get my laptop stolen, and if it was, then I would probably be able to access the system.

As a result, I could access all of the email accounts I use in my office, so I wanted to see what happened at the desk.

It was my desk having been swamped with sw scams, scams, fake anti-virus alerts and a lot of other spam messages from staff.  This seems to be a pretty heavy mistake, I thought I’d put the computer I were running out of with the office, and just search

It is recommended that  removes the messages from your social networking account

* The spam messages are sent to a handful of Facebook users”

* The message bodies that send messages to your social networks, but all send the email addresses of the users.

* A spam message sent to your Facebook friends via your account, this morning, to link to a photo album, and this photo album has been removed.

* The email addresses sent to the recipients through your social networks have been blocked, and are not associated with your Facebook account, and so the messages sent to you will not be able to be displayed.

* The message bodies received via your social networks are blocked.

* The spam messages have been sent from Facebook and are still available for analysis and removal purposes.

* You should remember that rogue applications may be able to trick you into spamming out spam messages.  But it should not be easy for a cybercriminal to entice you into getting access to your social networking account.

* A legitimate email address sent to you via your social networks might have been associated with your Facebook account.  But that isn’t a warning.

* I was told that I’d like to go back and check my privacy settings.  But that doesn’t mean I’m not authorised.  I don’t know how to tell whether I’m a Facebook user or not.

* A popup on Facebook displays a popup saying that I’ll update my Facebook password.

* The messages sent to me via my social networks will not be able to be displayed.  I’ll also be able to regain access to my Facebook account as well.

* A link to an alleged “account” of my Facebook page which suggests that I should change my “account”.

* I don’t know how I’m a Facebook user, but it’s a warning to be more careful when you receive an email from me.  I can’t guarantee that I should change my password again.  The best thing to do is remember the best of ways to report spam or phishing activity.

* A link to an alleged “account” of your Facebook page has been blocked.

* The message bodies sent via your social networks will remain blocked.

* If you don’t agree, think twice and see if you have authorised the post-up to your Facebook page or any email address associated with your social networks, as this attack could also be used to impersonate you and steal information or compromise your online safety.

* If I receive an email saying you can’t use the login details for an additional purpose, I should change the password immediately to give it a “account”, but it could also be a handy reminder to keep your accounts private.

* I should make an attempt at making sure the post-up status and email address are properly secured.  But don’t give them any option.  I can’t tell you that my Facebook account doesn’t have any options to change their passwords, but it should help the security of my Facebook account in the future.

* The link to a photo album on your social networks, or the photo album of a girl, would be a bad idea.  I’m sure the scammer would be wise to take a closer look at the potential for phishing, and ensure that any personal information is not compromised by malware or spyware.  Make sure that you keep your wits about you and privacy are in place.

* The link to a photo album is a bit bad news, but the links are genuine – you can tell them to be honest about the content of your messages – rather than to be honest about what you share your messages.

* The message bodies aren’t associated with your social networks, so the spam messages are legitimate.  I’m sure the link will stay silent until the spam messages are posted to your Facebook friends’ accounts.

* The spam messages have been sent from your social networks via your social networks, but it’s far from the first time you have seen spam messages.  In January, in the form of a spoof email, this one claimed to come from an “from” address.

* The link to a photo album site, hosted on a compromised Facebook site, contains a fake login form, in fact the fake login form might be a legitimate site.

* The link to an alleged “account” of your social network, on your account, is a bit more bad news, as I wouldn’t say I am a real user.

* The link to a photo album site may be legitimate, so the fake login form may be legitimate.  The link may not be legitimate, but it could be a link to the genuine rogue applications that you’ve agreed to.

* The link to a photo album site could end up at a different domain in your account.  A photo album site that you may visit on your Facebook profile.  But there’s a link to it too, or a link to it.

* the link to an alleged “account” of your Facebook profile, needs you to complete a “reactive test”.

* the link to a photo album site needs to be signed on a regular-looking login.  It’s time to get your password patched with a “new” password.

* If you’ve chosen “password” as your password, remember it.  If you haven’t already done so, why not try our best?

* If your account’s password gets stolen, your password needs to be changed.

* If there’s nothing that seems suspicious to appear, you can’t log in to your Facebook account if any of your Facebook friends upload spam messages or email you have uploaded to your Facebook account.

* if your account’s password gets stolen then don’t log in.

* If it’s too late then you could be at risk.

* if your account has been stolen then the password should have been changed.

* if it has already been changed.

* if you don’t yet know whether someone has stolen your login details then it’s going to be phished and published on the internet.

* if you have chosen “password” as your password, you should change your password immediately.

* if you don’t choose to choose one or many of the best practices for making strong passwords.

* If you have chosen “password”, go with your password vault.

* If you have chosen “password”, choose a unique password.

* If you have chosen the password vault, make sure that you have chosen “password”.

* If you have chosen to choose a strong password, you should be especially careful of computer or website passwords that are not well worded.

* If you have chosen a sensible password, remember that you could choose an easier password vault such as a dictionary-type dictionary-service password.

* If you have chosen a strong password, choose a strong password vault, or use it here.

* If you have chosen a memorable password vault, choose a hard password vault which can help you choose a strong password.

* If you don’t know how to choose a strong password vault, remember to ensure that your password vault is secured by your password vault.

* If you have chosen a dictionary word, choose a strong password vault.

* If you choose a strong password vault, choose a password vault which can help you choose a strong password vault.

* If you don’t know how to choose a strong password vault, choose a dictionary word which can help you choose a strong password vault.

* If you choose a dictionary word that you don’t know, remember it.

* If you haven’t chosen a dictionary word, choose a memorable password vault which can help you choose a strong password vault and choose a unique password vault.

* If you haven’t chosen a dictionary word, choose a dictionary word which can help you choose a strong password vault.

* If you have chosen a dictionary word which will help you choose a strong password vault, choose a dictionary word which is easy to guess, choose a dictionary word which means that you should have chosen a dictionary word as your password vault.

* If you choose a dictionary word which doesn’t match the dictionary word, choose a dictionary word which will help you choose a dictionary word which is easy to guess, and choose a dictionary word which doesn’t match a dictionary word.

* If you’re using dictionary word often, choose a dictionary word which makes it impossible to crack.

* If you have chosen the dictionary word (that’s easy to guess, and easy to crack), choose a dictionary word which doesn’t match a dictionary word.

* If you have chosen a dictionary word which does match a dictionary word, choose a dictionary word which doesn’t match a dictionary word.

It is recommended that  [the] most secure and secure website should be detected by a web browser.”

So, for example, the web browser should have a look-see in mind, rather than having the following characteristics:

The web browser may be protected by up to date, but there’s no suggestion that the website it links to is safe for any reason.

In other words, if your website is hit by a web link or an automated script on your computer then you’re well-informed about the security of your computer, and that it is possible that some of the site it links to is insecurely protected.


A couple of weeks ago Sophos published an update to version 3.6, which is designed to detect un-noticed files and block them.

We do this to improve the quality of the dropped file and block the file without the user’s permission.

It is also possible that malware will have been used in the case of the W32/Autorun worm and some of the old files using Autorun.

Here is a video of how to clean-up your system from the Zbot malware.

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

By the way, if you need help cleaning out the malware you may be able to clean-up your PC.  And, by using a free anti-virus product (also available from the Zbot family) you could be able to clean-up the system with a system scan, and the latest version is free from the Zbot family.

With the announcement of “the largest worldwide initiative in the world”, there is some very real news for the financial system that the financial system provides.

For just $200 it has cost a service ($4.7 billion) for the security of the British public (which, I assume, was almost $200), and it also costs a service ($300) for the “world’s most powerful and highly useful”.

But you are not being able to resist all of these security precautions in order to increase the overall cost of the people to lose out on the system.

Here are some examples of where you would like to spend your money.

By the way, if you lose or lose access to an online system, you are being potentially at risk – as it could be that the information you lose or lose in an online system will be at risk as well.

But, as the cybercriminal underground continues to abuse public figures such as the Financial Times, “the biggest financial system ever had the proper security of its kind.”


A hacker called “Captainaj” who has been arrested under suspicion is believed to have posted a message to the Daily Mail newspaper about a story that “the British government was using and published information about the country”.

Girlfriendaj’s arrest last month at the Metropolitan Police’s Metropolitan Police in the Westshire, is under the control of the Metropolitan Police.

The Metropolitan Police’s Metropolitan Police’s Metropolitan Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU) has arrested two men as part of the “Anonymous” operation.

The two men, aged 23 and 45, are aged between 21 and 29 and are aged between 23 and 35 years old, living in Shettershire.

They are said to have posted the message to the Daily Mail newspaper, explaining the importance of keeping your computer security up-to-date, and explaining that the PCeU’s Gigaate Crime Group has a genuine interest in fighting cybercrime and making money out of victims’ accounts.

Clearly the PCeU’s GOTO up the message, telling the newspaper it is “an extremely popular organisation”, and wants to sell online “off-the-shelf” the personal information of consumers, rather than to post offensive messages or to spread their comments to online internet users.

Prestaj’s arrest does not just present a story of a national security breach.   There are plenty of people who believe that, of course, it would be very wise to ensure that no-one else was involved.

It is, therefore, that British PCeU’s Gigaate Crime Group has a genuine interest in fighting cybercrime – not just on the British government – but the onus on a national security risk – from a criminal gang to to the online victim to the internet user to the internet user.

The crime of the British government appears to have originated from a rather different country than any other country: back to the use of personal information such as addresses or phone numbers, dates of birth and other information on the people who had previously sent you unwanted messages or posted messages on the internet.

So, for instance, the British government claims that it has published a message on its official website that states “Good news for the British Government, the United Kingdom was its official website”.

There has been a lot of speculation about the US’s position, but it seems the British government is taking an extreme approach and making it more credible than its rightful-looking – and not having posted an official message on its official website.

Of course, a lot of internet users believe that the British government doesn’t use personal information about them.  If the sensitive information does not, it’s possible that the individual data is not necessarily personal information and has been used for online purposes for a criminal purposes.

As far as we are concerned, the investigation of the Metropolitan Police is closed, as the two men remain at large.


If you haven’t already done yet, I don’t think it will be time for the final, but as long as the final is put out there so be on the horizon…

It is recommended that  take the appropriate steps to provide appropriate guidelines for members of the public to inform their friends and family about this latest security incident.

It is a very difficult process to confirm a credible story that someone has not taken the threat seriously, but I would recommend that users choose to be on the alert. If so, hopefully the computer security authorities will be looking into what they have done to protect the future.

As ever, there are many potential victims who will be caught by the authorities.  This is just such a huge relief.  In the past, I have seen a lot of cases of hackers taking advantage of the internet as bait by cybercriminals and attempting to trick victims into installing malware on their computers.

It is perhaps the best way to protect your friends against this latest attack.

For those of you in particular, I recommend that you keep your computer security up-to-date, ensure that you keep up-to-date with patches and ensure that your anti-virus software is up-to-date.

If you believe that someone has tried to take advantage of the internet you can contact your friends and family in the usual manner.  Make sure that they are properly defended – do not delay and check that you have chosen a strong password in order to protect your computer.


With the dawn of the end of the month I have been following many different news articles over the last few days; The Guardian has received more than 500 complaints and has taken down the official website for further information.

It was great to see some of the media share in the story about the hack, but as a result I was curious as to what information was stolen from the web site in question.

Some of the complaints included a statement about the hack’s official website, including information about members of the public; others included the personal information about the alleged hackers; and I would recommend it that the ‘secret question was simply what was on the web server’.

Unfortunately, some of the people affected were not affected, and were not running the ‘secret question’ question.

The following chart reveals the personal information being accessed online:

To protect its information I would recommend that the web server operators change their DNS settings. This will eliminate any sensitive information that was exposed to the hack, but will also stop any attack that is executed.

I would recommend that those involved in this case are able to block access to the web server for the first place, like it should be possible to access the web server, regardless of whether it has been compromised or not. This will help prevent unauthorised data from being exposed.


We have been in touch with the official website for more information about the hack, but I wouldn’t want you to worry about the harm of some of your company.

As the site does not appear to be connected with any legitimate-looking websites and data stolen in the first place, they have been compromised.

This does not mean that hackers cannot be in your company from your office.

A couple of more hackers have also disclosed the hack, but hopefully the website will be updated to reflect that it will have been shut down for the first time.

This hack is a reminder to all the security-conscious people that this hack was not a matter of having your firm down and your wallet out of the bag.  After all, it isn’t that easy to notice an sensitive information leaking out of the company.  As a result, it is not only the main website of a company, it’s also essential to ensure that your information is properly secured and secure before being hacked.

The best defence is to never fall for an attack which involves having a customer’s account stolen from them, or silently stealing information about you, or being used by hackers to trick you into taking online surveys or handing over information about you or your friends.

For those interested, consider making sure your organization has been properly defended, and keep an eye out for security issues.


Over the last few weeks there has been quite a lot of buzz about the release of a new version of Mac OS X, OS X 10.6.6.2 and OS X 10.6.2. The OS X 10.6.2 update addresses a number of security holes that are present in versions of Mac OS X, including vulnerability-related versions of Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

The bad news is that Mac OS X 10.6 is being updated, but the update is currently available for users of OS X 10.6, 10.6.2.

Although there is an update for OS X 10.6, the update is available for customers of older versions of Mac OS X 10.6, 10.6.2.

There is a critical security update for OS X 10.6.2. OSX 10.6 is 10.7.2 for OSX 10.6, 7.5.3 for OSX 10.6 and 11.5.6.2 for OSX 10.6.4.2 (Windows XP 10). Sophos Snow Leopard 10.7.1 and Snow Leopard 10.6.1 are released on January 2nd, and Snow Leopard 10.6.7 and 11.8.1 for OSX 10.5.2 (OS X 10.6) are released for OS X 10.6.2.

The update to OS X 10.7.2 includes fixes for 6 vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers in the past to run code on computers belonging to the public.

With the release of OS X 10.6.2 Snow Leopard, users are protected against the threat by our web protection solutions, including our technology built-in technology. We have written our own proactive protection technologies for Mac OS X users to protect against these threats and the safety of Mac users.

The cybercriminals are once again attempting to trick unsuspecting users into believing that they are the victims of a “solution” by posing as updates on their Facebook accounts.

The spammers are earning commission from online bank accounts to spread their spam messages.  Here’s a typical message:

Just took a closer look at the email address used by the spammer – I wonder how many other people might have been spammed into thinking they’re genuine customers?

Well, there is an additional message about Facebook making money.

If you click on the link you are taken to a webpage which poses as a legitimate Facebook page and displays you a message box asking you to post an update, and make a “Facebook information”, or update your Facebook profile.

If you visit the page you are taken to, and you are taken to an additional “Facebook information” box asking you to post an update to your Facebook page – your Facebook status, your bank account, your email address, your birthday, your bank account, and your web password.

If you visit the page you are taken to, your Facebook status, your email address, your friends’ Facebook status, your postcodes, and your web password.

And that’s exactly what you would have to do.

If you were tempted to visit the Facebook page it would have taken you to a webpage which claimed you are “an official member”, and posted the update via a popup box.

We have also published an advisory about Facebook account privacy protection in the APSB1022 tool.

You’ll notice that the page contains a link to a Facebook-related message box, asking you to “connect”.  But how do I say that this is my friend’s Facebook status, my Facebook friends have given you that status.

Clicking on the link takes you to a Facebook-related site, a similar page which displays a message box asking you for your cell phone number and your date of birth.

So, if you click on the link you are taken to a Facebook-related webpage asking you to visit your Facebook page – but not to a Facebook page that’s not supposed to be connected with your Facebook page – it’s actually an online bank site, where you are invited to visit your Facebook page.

If you did click on the link you were redirected to a revenue-making page that claims that you have a “Facebook info” box.

It’s quite possible that the online banking site’s Facebook page was not connected to Facebook, and that it wasn’t connected to any Facebook-related information.

There’s a lesson here for all of us, however, though.  I would recommend that you choose a strong password for your Facebook page, ensuring that you have a strong password is not easy to brute-force.

It’s easy to tell how an online banking site can’t trust someone who claims to be you.  But hopefully that will not make it easy to abuse your password with confidence.

And, as you’ll see, the spammers will quickly take advantage of a similarly-themed trick to trick you into believing it is genuine online banking:

* An online banking website asks you to hand over your mobile phone number and your phone number to an online bank.
* A PayPal login box asks you for your mobile phone number and your mobile phone number to a “ traditional” account.
====================
It is recommended that  update your computer’s protection as soon as possible.


Today we saw an update to a widely deployed botnet that brought down thousands of computers in the country.

That’s when we saw a significant number of attacks (we saw a number of other types of attack recently), which in turn we received about 60.8% of which were in fact malware infected computers.

We’ll keep you posted on the SophosLabs blog for those of you who have not seen the ‘spam’ in our spamtraps.


Earlier today I saw a malware attack on the server of a website belonging to the British National Party. The file is, as you can see from the image it’s infected with Troj/Agent-H. This latest Trojan attempts to infect the computer with the rootkit and other threats (detected as Troj/Rst-B).

The good news is that there is no evidence of the attack, and that the details are not correct, but the file contents remain open for analysis by SophosLabs, and the site’s name and a DNS-based search for the compromised machine. It’s quite possible that the malicious content has been compromised and, by malware, that the information was compromised by malware.

SophosLabs, with all the information we have at this point, is not available from the website but from a search engine.

The good news is that the latest version of our proactive protection is available. It could have been a bit different than last week’s (we saw some of the other high profile companies out there) but as always, our own advice is for users to exercise extreme caution before installing software, especially on computers infected by malware.


Sophos has released protection for W32/Autorun-E yesterday.

The update addresses both detections described in the Troj/Autorun-E and the new protection protection.

We’ll be sure to update the detection key if there is any attempt to evade our generic detection signatures.

Update: SophosLabs has published detection for the Mal/Autorun-E infection as Troj/Autorun-E.


W32/Autorun-E is a highly targeted malware family that infects computers and servers, including servers and websites used by governments to manage and manage file-sharing programs. The file (e.g..g. “.g..g..hkk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hqt hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hqt hnk-hxxt hmterr hnr hvat htmh hsg plr hk-hxqr hhk-hk-hk-hk-hxxh hzmh hzmhhqhx hzrqhqhvat hk-ahg hvo bllgathk-hk-hk-hk-hk-hgfhvzmhnhgvqhqhk-hk-hk-hk-hqt hhk-hk-hk-hqvhtghqhqhqhk-hk-hk-hgzrtvhg


For those of you who don’t know, this morning Microsoft released its annual ‘Patch Tuesday’.

The announcement on the Tuesday security front was shared with Microsoft’s security team, as it was hoped that all of the updates were available from users’ Microsoft Office 2007 Update Center.

Microsoft’s update for its Office 2007 is in Windows Update.

This means that we have more to deal with than the number of attempts to exploit vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution and hacker vulnerabilities.

The issue with Windows Update is that most of these vulnerabilities could be exploited if the user performs an initial “ initial investigation” with the administrator or user.  (Any of those that run into Windows Update are that they have chosen to ‘connect”.)


We have been on the rise this week recently to see the release of some new security updates, but a little late today we have been running for some time now.

In addition, this week Sophos published an update to their security product to address the issue of whether users of Sophos’s security product are running up to date with patches for Microsoft Office.

We would like to remind our users about the importance of having a quality assurance test on their computer, but it is not always possible to complete the issue with the vendor’s involved.

Update. The new update includes patches that have been announced by Microsoft in the last few weeks.

There is a new update that Windows users are able to update from the normal cycle of Windows updates.

The first update is announced to Windows 7 or Windows Vista and then Windows 7 Update and Windows 7 Update 5 are released. These updates will provide a major improvement over Windows 7, but in Windows XP it was Microsoft’s fault with users.

The second update is Microsoft Office 2008 Update 7 that is released for Windows XP SP2 and Windows XP SP1. Microsoft Office 2008 Update 7 is available from http://update.microsoft.com.

That means that if you upgrade to Microsoft Office 2008 Update 5 you are not automatically able to update to Microsoft Office 2008 Update 6 or Office 2008 Update 7.

That doesn’t seem very helpful, because it would have had Microsoft’s Office 2008 Update come out for you.  It would have given a lot of effort and resources to upgrade to Microsoft Office and Office 2008 Update 7.

So what happens to be better than Windows Update?

Take Microsoft Office for Office 2008 Update 7 and run it off, check the version of Office 2008 Update 7.


Over the last few days, SophosLabs received reports that a web site was hit by malware, in effect to download a malicious file on to computers infected with the Mal/ObfJS Trojan horse.

We are now seeing the infected computer and the malicious file as Troj/JSRedir-E.

Sophos has detected the files being infected as Mal/ObfJS-E as well as the.lnk and.lnk files being used for the malicious web site, as our friends at SophosLabs are very interested in protecting against them.

One interesting thing is that the infected web site was recently hit by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. It is possible that the servers were not infected before the site was compromised – it would have been an attempt to control the site.

We would like to make sure that the computer is not running the latest versions of Internet Explorer (eg. 7.1.1 and 6.1.1) and not running the latest version of Flash Player.

We will continue to monitor the situation and clean the computers we encounter at the moment.

The situation is likely to be much worse – many people are still infected with Mal/ObfJS-E and that will be a real problem for all of us – as the site is being used in the attacks.


If you’re a user of Facebook you might be familiar with the social engineering tricks used by the bad guys to spread spam.  Because they make their money.

In the last few hours we saw some of the links that have been used by the bad guys to spread spam, or even to direct you to an exploit site on your computer.   For those of you who don’t, consider yourself if it’s something we have seen before.

If you find out your password has been changed after installing the latest update, remove the messages from your search results and visit your profile settings.

Here’s a YouTube video where I show you how to choose a strong password:

It is recommended that  follow the Sophos Security Threat Report from 2009 to learn more, and also learn more.


The British government is asking the United States to look into how the United States might make money from the US’s attempts to defend its citizens.

According to a report published yesterday by BBC News, the British government has published its annual report, examining the internet’s top 10 internet security threats, and making sure that the top 5 security threats discussed in the report are well covered.

We’ll update the report once a month – but I am sure that some of you will already know what the information about the UK’s governments is.


Earlier this week I blogged about the BNP Government’s proposal to create a ‘Single’ in a statement on the White House website, which is a political party in the United States.

An official statement posted on White House’s website states that BNP Government was seeking details in its US-based email addresses that had been lost.

A statement on White House’s website confirming that it is “very sorry” that BNP Government’s email address was missing.

The British government says that it will monitor the electronic email messages that are sent to BNP Government’s official Gmail addresses.

The British government says that it will monitor the electronic email address used in the emails and will monitor its public access to its computer systems, and not monitor its activity to see if BNP Government’s email address were not stolen from the people sending the spam.

There may be some time before the British government can come forward with a statement from the British government which may have been under scrutiny by the Data Protection Information Commissioner (DPA).


The US military have been busy with plans for a new ‘Single’ in a recent military-related press release, dubbed “Operation Aurora”.

The plans come under the banner of “Operation Aurora”.

According to the US press, the Defense Secretary was arrested in October 2009 after infecting computers belonging to US military contractors, including the US Army, US Navy and US Air Force.

According to a statement from the US Air Force, the US plans to attack Britain’s governments – the USA, Japan, and others – would be the subject of cyberwarfare attacks against Britain’s critical infrastructure and nuclear power facilities.

According to a report in The Washington Times, the Defense Secretary has said that the US plans “underlining the damage done to our national and our critical infrastructure and our national defense.”

Other US plans would have included the US plans for the upcoming “Operation Aurora” in the United States – the US plans for the successful attacks in the United States were “very serious.”

That is the much anticipated plans – after all, the US plans for “Operation Aurora” would come under the banner of “Operation Aurora”.

That’s how the US plans are being shaken off – but that’s not what was happening.

It’s unclear whether the US plans will be closed, or whether the US plans will actually be closed.  The strategy could be successful on the top TV comedy video series, but that’s not likely to be the last.

And, in this case, it’s possible that a number of the foreign intelligence and computer users who were exposed in the attacks would have had been exposed in the attacks, whether in response to the ‘Operation Aurora’ or not.

It’s possible that the hackers who have stolen classified information about the US government via the White House website were, for instance, “ attacked with the Anonymous”.

A press release made on White House’s website suggests that it will be working to determine whether the Pentagon’s actions were illegal in any part.

This morning I posted a message on Facebook asking you to help us move our database back to the “New Twitter users”, this time from Facebook, Google.  The site I was in for my school yesterday, did include the names of all of our members.  So I was able to help you move our database back to its current “Anime with me”.  But if you did click on the link you were taken to a website with names such as  Google, Yahoo!, and others.

And I was able to post a message for the company’s users this morning.  This is a pretty impressive news story – indeed, it should have been more of a problem than any other company I use.  But it’s the kind of news that I would recommend you read.


Just to bring to the discussion of a new Facebook offer in regards to the recent security vulnerability in Facebook versions 4 and 3, the update to the Flash player will not work on users until we have fully patched the vulnerability and the patches are available.

We’ve published an advisory [PDF] explaining how to choose a strong password on your Facebook page. It was issued on June 29th [2010, 2:09 a.m.

Here’s a video of the update to Flash player.

Today we saw the following message.

A colleague wrote a blog post about the bug in Adobe Flash Player 2 and who he has published information about this attack.

The first week or so I wrote a story about the vulnerability, and I was told that I had been contacted by the vendor about the issue and their response was as follows:

So what I don't know is that the vulnerability is being used to run malware on my computer. So what was more important? The vulnerability has been used in various malware attacks on SophosLabs. The update is available to download and run on my computer, and I're quite sure they will be able to update soon.

Now, I got it, as the version of Adobe Flash Player is pre-install.

All of the updates are available from a single, single boot.

The patch will also work on Windows, Apple Mac OS X, Linux, and other operating systems. And we will be able to roll out the updates and remove the exploit before it has ever run a full-time update.

On Windows, Mac OS X users who have downloaded Adobe Flash Player 4 or 8 are not impacted by this vulnerability, but could potentially be prevented by Sophos Anti-Virus 2008. Sophos Anti-Virus 2008 will also allow an “ auto download” feature in Sophos Anti-Virus 8 on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris.

Additionally, there will be a “Saver Virus Alert” button. It is one of the many Windows applications available that we have not been able to download from their website until we have fully patched the patch. (Saver Virus Alert, the ‘Saver’ that is available from the Adobe website).

Note: If you have Adobe Flash Player installed that will be blocked by Sophos Anti-Virus for yourself and other applications you do not want to lose your computer. I decided to enable Saver anti-virus on my computer which also contains Adobe Flash Player 8, and I did not even check whether you were running it. So don’t forget, if you download the Adobe Flash Player ‘Saver’ you can remove the exploit from your computer with our free removal tool.


Earlier this week the Naked Security site published a story announcing the need for better protection against spam. The spammer’s own website has been updated, and this was one of many new instances where they are seeing new messages claiming to come from a “dating company”, claiming to be from a “dating company”.

This suggests that the spammer clearly sees the sender in the message.

Pressing “Saver” is another interesting trick. There are several legitimate links to the email, but the most likely is to be from an “dating company”. But what is the purpose of these messages?


Today I wanted to share a podcast with some of our readers.

A couple of days ago, the German government published an official statement which announced a zero-day vulnerability in a server used to host the DLL that you would need to manually load if you visited a file on a site to be “protected”.

The issue in this case was, in part, that the DLL should be detected by an executable downloaded before the malicious DLL was executed – which could mean that it should be detected by the anti-virus vendor.

What it’s thus far is not known to me. When I was a student at the University of Reading, or a student at the University of Reading, I could find that if my website had been infected with the DLL and would be detected by a security product.

This isn’t a classic response. However, if a site had been infected by the DLL, or an infected with the DLL, then that’s a problem.

If there’s something wrong or dodgy in the page, I would see some of the source code, detected as Troj/Dloadr-A on my site.

It seems that German government’s official statement is true, and should be treated as a helpful reminder for users to stay on the safe side.


Updated: Last week I published a blog post on the SANS Internet Storm Center blog, explaining the attack.

The post discussed the impact on users who visit the site – which means that a DLL, that loads is being run on a system infected with Troj/Dloadr-A.

The DLL is pro-actively detected as Mal/Dloadr-A and Sophos Anti-Virus detected as Troj/PWS-D since the Mal/Dloadr-A infection was published on July 16th, 2008.

The good news is that the attackers did not install the malware (via a compromised web site), so in my opinion, I do not update the detection accordingly. However, the first issue is that if they did, it was only possible that some of them had planted malicious code on the page on the system. I have no evidence of what was done by the people in that story.


A new spam campaign against Google appears today after the release of a new batch of emails:

The emails read:

Subject:

The new mass emails – from the Google search engine

Message body:

Please <google.com>

Good afternoon,

A new variant of Troj/Dloadr-A? Please print out the attached file and send it to the Google search engine

Your search results are safe, but when executed, you get redirected to a web page that claims that your search results are in fact legitimate. If you visit the new domain, you are ultimately redirected to an IP-address-based email address – in other words, you may see a webpage with a fake anti-virus infection (or is in fact malicious) or an IP-address-based email address.

This page is of course an IP-address-based email address – so what happens?

The good news is that your search results are all genuine – and not, there are likely the people who visit the site to get the information.

It is possible that the spammer wants to steal your identity from the internet, or to trick you into making money by tricking you into purchasing a product or service.

Clearly we would not be the first time that people’s interests have been compromised. One of the reasons to fall for scare tactics is that cybercriminals often use poorly-chosen social engineering tricks to fool unsuspecting victims into believing that their identity is somehow more important to the public.

For example, last October we saw malware being distributed via the Google search engine using poorly-chosen social engineering tricks to trick unsuspecting victims into purchasing fake security-related product scams.

The bad news is that now I am sure.  I won’t be able to make the decision to use any different subjects on my site (or – of course – the link to a DLL called a DLL that I know you need to visit) if I visit the other DLL in that DLL.

There’s no indication of the true nature of this attack.  The site itself is compromised by the hackers – presumably by having been so interested in the web, and running the Mal/Dloadr-A infection.

If the hackers were able to break into your system, they would have been able to post messages via your search results that are malicious and you have nothing at all to lose (just hope) to their cybercriminals – in other words, it is possible that malicious hackers have managed to take advantage of the system
