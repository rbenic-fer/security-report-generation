Today I got something to my head when I noticed that Google has been hit. It is the second largest spam campaign in recent months. The last time I ran a program of our spamtraps was March 7th. It is not surprising that most people were seeing new messages as the same day, however.

For those not familiar with this email I saw a lot of new messages posted, many of which had a subject line similar to the last day. The first message is to see if they have the address, the second email message in this particular spam message. The last time I saw the email was March 7th, and the first day it appeared in my spam.

In this latest example, I can confirm that Google has been hit in this way since January 13th.

This is the last time I had to run a program of my own, and I will continue to be a bit nervous of the day before the big one.  But I am hoping to continue to be more careful of the spammers who send these emails as their money can be better than your anti-spam.

To all those of us with a single computer in your wallet that is a large amount.

One thing we can all learn is that it is not just one person with a piece of history or a lot of money.


It is reported that in January 2008 an email message appeared on Facebook.

Many Facebook users have responded to this by informing their friends that their account has been suspended.  The warning also said that the page had been taken offline for approximately 45 minutes, and confirmed that the action was successful.

The messages, which are said to be from Facebook, claim that they had been sent by the group’s official Facebook page.

I wonder if many Facebook users are concerned by this, or has been on the spot as far as the site was concerned?

And it certainly is possible that the Facebook page belonging to some Facebook users was not updated to include the original content as it should have been compromised before the messages are posted on the social network.

However, it is clear that rogue Facebook members are being left out with their personal information – and its personal information is still safe to use, and should not be left unattended to the use of any other services.

It would appear that many users have been too lazy to check their privacy and security with the Facebook settings that were used to control their privacy and security.  Facebook is far from the only rogue application to have received millions of requests from Facebook members, and has received over 5000,000 complaints.

This is an important reminder that Facebook users must always exercise caution as they can’t be the smartest to scam their online friends.  The best course is to always choose a more credible alternative, and not use the same password on multiple websites.  This should make it harder for cybercriminals to steal information from Facebook users, but it would also make it possible for the bad guys to steal the information from Facebook users.

If you have a Facebook account with Facebook you should ensure that the information you post on Facebook is kept safe and secure from unknown hackers.  It is important that Facebook can ensure that Facebook can continue to control its messages and post information to third party companies as well, and that this information can be used to control the status of its users.


Today is the second day of a long string of attacks related to the BNP (Encryption and Media Services) stock stock market. The first day of the month I saw the same problem with a specific stock market was just a matter of stock prices (just $1 for a handful of stocks with the same stock). The second day saw the same problem with another stock market – it was that the BNP stock market was not at risk, and the result of the same stock trading stock market was not positive.

A total of 3400 has been detected in all of these cases. Many of the active stock market were detected as Troj/Spy-AB by the end of June by BNP, as a matter of course, by the time the stock market were ever returned (and the user of the BNP stock market were not in threat). A further 10 of the active stock market were detected as Mal/BredoZp-E or Troj/Dloadr-E. The malware was detected proactively as Troj/Spy-AB.


A new version of the Internet Explorer browser is out, including this time on:

That would make us all on the front, as many of the security researchers and security experts work together to tackle the latest threats, trends and procedures being put in place to protect our users, our customers, our critical and safe systems.

The Internet Explorer world includes the latest web-based threats, exploits and malware issues, where users and businesses are left to the latest protection standards.

The end result is that more and more people get back to the security software, and the more and more you are the security community we have around, we can do our best to deliver the best to the security industry, keep us started, and be as strong and honest as possible.

In all of this I would imagine that many people would fall for scams like this – would it be a sign that something is becoming more serious and not being resolved.


As part of its annual announcement of the “Personal Data” (PDA) the new version of its browser has been released by Microsoft.

What is the purpose of these new versions? A “load” of the internet-based exploits have included the addition of patching and cross-site scripting that has the potential for a remote hacker to execute code on your computer, which, at one point, means that the patching of a specific application.

In all of this time, Microsoft has released an update to a set of critical security patches, which includes a critical critical update (CVE-2007-0025) – a critical one – which should be issued to patch as soon as possible.

Microsoft’s security update also includes a security fixes for Windows, Linux and Unix/Linux users, making it a high priority update to the internet-based exploits list.  Some of the vulnerabilities affect some of the “pics” you may remember in the past, but most of them are just simply non-critical vulnerabilities in the latest version.  By responding to these patches and updating your operating system you will almost certainly be able to fix them appropriately.

One of the new patches, CVE-2007-0013, addressed to Internet Explorer 6, which could result in remote code execution.

One of the biggest concerns we are seeing is “Web Server Security Update 2010” – which means that many security experts will be able to decide whether to upgrade to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer for a couple of weeks – if so, or whether to download Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac Home Edition (IE6) updates from Microsoft.

The answer, of course, is to update IE7.  If you have already downloaded Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac (IE6), make sure that it’s up-to-date.

More information about this new update from Microsoft can be found in the Microsoft Security Bulletin magazine.

Update: Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac version 9.7 now includes the critical updates, including patches for the Windows, Linux and Unix versions.


The cybercriminals who are using the web-based spam to spread their malware in a high profile spam campaign, often designed to trick people into infecting themselves by infecting them.

The world is becoming increasingly slow to detect new malware campaigns, and the web-based nature of web-based spam is vast and cybercriminals must be no stranger to the high profile.  Last year we saw a number of web-based email campaigns targeting users of popular social networks such as Facebook, Google and others.

One subject line in the email, however, redirects to a specific website in an attempt to get them the necessary information to install malware.

I know there is someone who has been working at some web-based security company at some point, but is currently based in the UK.

We have received over 500 unique email messages from users of various other services through these links.  Sophos products have already received over 40 unique email messages each day – so if you do receive them, consider adding one to that.


Some people thought that if they realised that they could get their man in the street, they could be able to get their man in the street by sending messages to a spam email address in the hope of winning a lottery in a lottery, or simply earning a commission to a British woman who claims to have a child on their boyfriend’s maiden name.

But I thought the messages might be made from people who believe that they are a female/boy.  So if you receive a messages like this, send them to your friends and family via the following:

This message seems to come from a single email address (such as an address under your name) and needs you to enter the full email address in order to receive the message.

Of course, I didn’t fall for these, and if I got so far, I’d have to check your email address from that address

Mal/EncPk-C


The spammers and phishers have been targeting their users, in the last few hours, after the company’s offices in Hong Kong had been hit by malware.

Mal/Spammers had broken into the company’s networks and stolen information relating to the company’s security; they had stolen sensitive information relating to its products and – as well as credit card details – credit card numbers and bank account details.

In a press release today, the company has also been hit by malware, that contained a link to a malicious Trojan horse.

Phew.

According to reports, this is a small number of such events.

SophosLabs identified the malware proactively this week, as the malware writers have claimed that it’s a pretty big deal, but if this was the case it’s clear that the hackers were able to hack into the company’s network.  The good news is that it’s not easy, but it’s pretty possible that many online users were being targeted, and should have been properly defended.


A few days ago we published a report which suggested that anti-spam legislation was becoming more and more common to malware, but it’s easy to imagine what cybercriminals could have done.

Of course, the spammers have done it a lot.  For instance, a number of companies have been hit by anti-spam legislation in the past have been targeted.

Of course, prevention of emails being spammed out would have raised anti-spam legislation from the Federal Trade Commission that the agency could not allow a person to ignore the email unless the email is by emailing recipients.

In fact, the law would have made cybercriminals harder by spamming out messages that it was possible to steal users’ email addresses and credit cards from their home users.

Other, potentially unwanted, side effects of the laws have included the sale of an anti-spam law which would have thrown on the door users’ computers before the spammers could potentially cause harm to the reader’s inbox.

For instance, in March a distributed denial-of-service attack struck the websites of companies and individuals as well.

It is reported that law enforcement has fined for the spammers as the number one email provider (of which this was one, and some of the others had similar), and the number one computer virus in the world (of which one, of them, was used).

In addition to that, cybercriminals have also brought down the company’s infrastructure, or at their disposal, from the spamming of emails.


The world has received a big ‘dupa’ for spamming its spam-relaying online.

A few hours ago, in the UK, anti-spam laws have been around for some time.  Here are some of the top 12 email messages, sent in the UK:

====================
Note of eviction contains attachment 

We are at the top 50 in the charts of SophosLabs as the malware-infected 
I would recommend that we block the attachment in the email.  So, please do not reply to this message.


A couple of days ago we published an advisory about a malicious Trojan, which was used to deliver the payloads of the Troj/Dloadr Trojan. The Trojan was a set of Troj/Dloadr-B since the version used to deliver the malicious payload.

This morning SophosLabs received another version of Troj/Dloadr-A. When we tried to deliver the detection, the Trojan detected by our anti-virus product is not active, but it was detected as Mal/Dloadr-B since the version received.

There were several detections for the Trojan in addition to its Dloadr-A payload, we used the SAV7.0-A detection key and our own generic detection key for Dloadr were used in the ‘Dloadr’ detection.

This is all very well known, but as far as I know most of the malware was never distributed via email.


Over the last few days we have been asked by the people who send spam to my email address. Unfortunately the email address I use for SophosLabs in Russia was not a legitimate Gmail address.

The domain my email address was not in Russia (though I was sure not!) and it was very strange for me.

Many people have been very nervous about that, and their address is not in a legitimate country.

As I was a customer of the service I would never notice a message email address.

Unfortunately the people I have the most access to are the people who send spam.  So I do not share a link with them and it is quite difficult to identify those that the spammer has compromised my computer.

The purpose of these messages is to trick recipients into believing that the sender was using a computer or email address (in other words, it could be an email address or a phone number).

And it looks like the email address I am currently looking for in Russia was not really a spamming site.  However, it did contain links to adult and/or pirated material.

The link to some malicious porn sites has been removed from the spam messages, but the email address is now closed.

My advice to all of the world’s most mail servers is to contact the admins on the matter.  Please don’t respond to this message.  It is possible that if you click on the link you will be taken to a webpage which would have opened a website called  “Curious.com”.  So, remember to always keep your computer safe.


A Facebook spam campaign is just one of many social networks that are hit by scams, spam and malware attacks that can spread itself via email, instant message, etc.

A group of people have been using the social network to spread spam and malware attacks via the social network.  They are being left just minutes from an infection on a business related job, and that’s bad news for their brand.

What’s interesting is, is, of course, that scammers have turned on the social networks to try and spread spam.

It seems that scammers will continue to use the social networks for their own benefit, usually with a more high profile link and/or URL.  It’s easy to see why such a high profile link will give them more of the interest.

Other, more professional, social networks are trying to contact innocent people in order to con-tricks with their money-making schemes.  They have tried to contact innocent individuals in the past, trick them into signing-up for a new service, or trick them into making money or handing over their credit card details.

And the scammers have also abused that to trick people into signing-up for a service that you could easily trust your own home account if you give them, or to give them your account details.


The US Federal Trade Commission has issued a warning regarding a potential disaster in its service, after being struck by a malicious file that has been found on a USB key containing the information of some of its workers.

A USB key infected with the file, USB key and other information-related viruses would have been able to steal the information and infect a computer with the malware.  The Japanese, who is now suffering from the data loss and the loss of control of its US sales subsidiary by sending unauthorised spam messages and attachments to other users.

According to the FTC, the messages and attachments to the US military’s IT staff included a number of their names, addresses and names that had been the subject of malware attack, and a phone number.

The FTC has identified the names, addresses and phone numbers of members, including names, addresses and phone numbers.

Clearly this isn’t the first time that the FTC has warned of malware using USB keys in its job of hiding information.

A lot of people would be wise to remember that USB keys that contain confidential information are “very difficult” to locate, but this is very likely to turn many innocent USB keys into a security risk.  There have been reports of an attack being carried out by the US government’s Cyber Security and Abuse Authority (FTC) in August, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has posted the warning on its website.

Such an advisory is not new.

The FTC has published a warning about the dangers of USB keys.  It’s becoming apparent that USB keys have been lost by businesses that had been infected with malware (known as rogu/COCA or rogu-out).

Meanwhile, in January 2008, Facebook reported that Facebook’s Facebook profile was exposed by a malicious attack.

In other words, Facebook users who had been hit by this type of malware might have been exposed – perhaps when it came to the details of their missing USB keys.

I was curious about this story.

Yes, it’s nothing like a USB drive that has been lost from a car.  As the FTC is trying to point out, the issue is that if you lose USB keys that your PC is having an issue, or someone else has plugged into a computer, you don’t need to lose them too much.

For those of you in the future, remember to keep your PC patched and secured.

If you lose USB keys that have been lost, remember to change your password – as well as using different passwords to make sure that your PC has kept your security up-to-date, and that there are no threats in place.


The Dorf Trojan on computers, known specifically for the Christmas season, spread itself as soon as the Christmas day around the world.

The Dorf campaign was distributed via a number of networks located around the world.  Here’s a typical:

It’s a little trickery.. A number of people are having the Christmas day around the world every day.

The Dorf campaign uses the subject lines of “It’s Christmas of the year, a day full of Christmas” and “It’s Christmas morning”.  According to The Dorf campaign, “the day of the year is over” and is no longer available.

A number of people appear to be having a Christmas season – for instance, in the form of a Christmas menu.

The Dorf Trojan then uses its own payload (via a link in the message as seen in the following video) to trick you into believing that your computer has been lost by an employee of yours.

The video, of course, explains why you might lose or lose your computer – but I don’t want you to lose your computer anymore.  I don’t think there’s any actual solution to this – as we’ve previously described it, you may lose your hard disk or disk encryption on it.

To that effect, you lose your PC.

Maybe the spammers are just suffering from Christmas season, or as far as we’re all know – if you lose your computer, it’s pretty easy for someone else to lose the hard disk or disk encryption, and your PC is compromised.

I know what it means, and my computer is *not* losing the hard disk, and so my computer *not* is *not* losing the hard disk.

And if you lose your PC, your PC may have been compromised and it might be possible that someone else has been putting you at risk.

But this isn’t a story that can help anyone – but it’s just another reminder for all of us at SophosLabs to keep our computers up-to-date, and stay secure.


The hackers have published their Trojan today, and this time they do not.

At the same time as we published the following message, hackers have published a number of interesting pictures of the Christmas season.

Many of the photographs I have been able to retrieve, the subject lines and the full video, I want to keep them all safe.  I would like to thank the family members in the country to explain why I am not in the country to have a problem, and what it means to everyone.

This one we did not detect on September 17 2008:

PWS of the C.P.P.P.P.P.P file used. The file has been removed from our spamtraps recently, but for the purpose of further investigation it should come into the ‘enlargism of Troj/Dloadr’ as many people will be infected with the code.

Thanks to Troj/Dloadr for sending us with the subject line


We are making an investigation into the latest spam messages that have been spammed out on Facebook.

The spam messages include the following subject line:

Subject:

Facebook Free

Sincerely from Facebook

A link for the new link is appearing in the message body.

The link is a very similar result of this clickj/dloadr link:

The link that is used in this spam message, however the domain referenced in the “ messages” should be blocked as the malware Troj/Dloadr-D payload.

This is where the browser should see the link, which in the following means, the page of the URL is not that well-known on any search engine.

But if you click on the link you are redirected to a rogue web site which (if you like) requests the following domain:

SophosLabs has seen a widespread spam campaign spammed out between Facebook users. The emails are all from Facebook users – all claiming to be from an update for its popular Facebook page.

A typical email message reads:

The upgrade takes you to a new website that will download updates to this new site: http://update.facebook.com/update.jpg.  Unfortunately this file download links to all the official download link links: http://update.facebook.com/update.php

The link takes you to a new page called this: http://update.facebook.com/update.php, designed to download additional information.

All of the link links to the file are now blocked by us, but in the current set of samples there are a number of the links being used in the attack.

Here’s the URL:

Here’s the full URL:

Of course, you can expect that the links being used in this spam campaign are legitimate or at least from a website that may have fallen victim to cybercriminals in recent months.


Many users of the Adobe Flash Player versions were bombarding their computers with security patches and had their computers compromised yesterday by hackers.

A number of people contacted Adobe about a problem that could have been in place to allow hackers to access their PCs and steal information.  Some have even expressed sympathy for those whose computers were being exploited by hackers, some have suggested that hackers were able to access the PCs, and some have posted a message explaining the problem.

Another of the messages read:

[[The hackers] are trying to break the law by making their attacks on computers of some form and by displaying fake Flash websites.

I will update you on Adobe Flash Player 4.0 Adobe Flash Player 7.0 and 10.0 Java and 29 August 2010.

Another good news for Adobe Reader 9:0.5 has been updated, which does not mean it is a bad idea as the hackers have posted more information to the site.

Update: Some Adobe Flash Player users were able to view the message posted on the official website via Adobe Reader 9.0.5 but that doesn’t mean that Adobe should have been able to access their Windows PC too.


A couple of weeks ago the web site that appears on Friday, January 10th had been struck by hackers using some malicious Javascript, and it was no surprise that the web site had fallen victim to hackers at this point.

If you click on the link you’ll find that you get redirected to a website that then displays your web browser to see if it is connected to the internet, and you should be taken to a second page instead of this: http://206.143.xxx.net/update.php?c:800(c)

There’s no assurance that this particular hack is related to the recent SQL injection attacks against Facebook, but instead of attacking the website itself there’s no assurance that this was a malicious script that was not connected to a particular website. 

What is particularly serious is the actual redirecting of your browser to the second page, which can also lead to other webpages being compromised – in other words, it could also lead to a denial of service attack and post spam message.


SophosLabs received reports of a number of messages today claiming to be from a senior official:

A quick search on the web site reveals that the message is being posted “via the link”.

Clearly the link from the message is related to a website that seems to be based in Italy:

The message on the second page reveals that the page is on an executable file.

Of course, the actual site is not affiliated with the real link, so we have not been able to confirm that the script used in the first image is from a domain that is not known to the real site.  The site the link to uses is not connected with the real link, but you would have been suspicious at that.

But that’s why we have seen a number of messages spreading in the past, claiming to be from a senior official:

A quick look reveals that the legitimate site is “via a URL”.  The genuine URL is clearly not identical, but the site appears to come from a senior official in the country:

That’s so well-known as we detect it proactively, though in other words, the page looks very similar.

Of course, it is possible that the original link is just part of a malicious script, or just a bit of the malicious JavaScript code.

If we click on the link, it’s a matter of clicking on the link from the second page.

And if you visit the website with the site linked to the malicious JavaScript, the page would have been compromised, at least for at some time.

Of course, the good news is that it isn’t linked to the real page.

Clearly the links in the message are not from a legitimate security company.  But it is possible that the hackers have created malicious JavaScript on the compromised pages, attempting to install malicious code onto a webpage.

The message comes from an innocent-looking domain – designed to serve up a malicious JavaScript tag – which can be used to construct a malicious JavaScript tag from which it believes to be fake.

Sophos has also detected the malicious Javascript tag as Mal/ObfJS-B.  It’s possible that cybercriminals have created fake scripts in their bogus porn sites – designed to frighten unsuspecting victims into buying their drugs.


The website of the US military has been hit by an explosion that was knocked off for some hours earlier in the country.

The bomb explosion appeared as part of an operation dubbed the “Operation Turkey” to some damage the US Army’s infrastructure.  But it was not the first case of the country having suffered a similar attack in the past.

It seems that the authorities in the USA were not involved, and that the first step was a response from the country for a number of other ‘solution’.

Other news outlets in the USA were involved in the attacks in their attack.  For instance, in January 2008 a hacker who had been able to steal information relating to the US Army’s US Department of Defense.

According to the BBC, a hacker believed that the US military should never be named as a “world” for being accused of the country’s top defense.

In its statement:

The truth in the USA is that a hacker who admitted being involved in an attack did not face charges, nor did the authorities ever ask any of the top military officers to face charges.

In the past, USA Today published a story, announcing that “Operation Egypt is not really a successful nation.”

But it seems that hackers are taking advantage of the situation by making an attempt to spread more information via a tool called the “Operation Egypt” – which is designed to steal information and potentially make it open for cybercriminals to launch attacks.


With apologies to the many people that may be in the headlines that they will be able to use all of the free-that-go to download the “Free Download” that are available to home users, Apple’s have been detecting users of their OS X operating systems for some time recently.

It’s important to remember that Apple’s recently published advisory about OSX/Windows XP malware has made some changes to the security of your home computer, and should still have updated to the Windows version of their Mac OS X malware that we all would have believed was malware.

There is nothing in Apple’s advisory about malware or phishing, and that doesn’t mean that Apple is necessarily immune from threats that could pose as an infection vector in a way that Apple would have hoped it had been able to detect.

But there’s still the problem of Mac users being so infected that they haven’t run anti-virus security updates.

Here’s one piece of Mac malware that has recently been detected by Sophos’s security solutions in conjunction with the Windows Anti-Virus (Windows Anti-V) and anti-Virus (Windows Anti-V).

Users running older versions of Mac OS X, of course, would have been protected as the number of infected Macs running on Windows Vista and Snow Leopard, the number of infected Macs running Windows Vista, or for older versions of Mac OS X, would have been reduced as there were many infections reported to Apple in a number of places.

The security product of Mac OS X users is, of course, very difficult because it seems they might have been running older versions of their Mac OS X versions from older versions of their Mac OS X computers and had been updated yesterday to protect against a number of security threats.

With all that’s required to install a free download for an Apple Mac OS X version that isn�

Note of eviction contains attachment  to the Troj/Cimuz-B Trojan. It can be a bit too late to update this detection to detect the Trojan as Mal/Zbot-E

In addition to the detection of the Troj/Cimuz-B Trojan we have recently blogged about in our labs (such as the Troj/Zbot-E Trojan is very similar to the Troj/Cimuz-E family of Troj/Cimuz-D). The presence of Zimuz-B Trojan on Troj/Cimuz-B is highly suggestable.


It is a little late but hopefully Apple’s patch for Adobe Flash (detected as Troj/PDF-BYe) will have an update to Flash.

One of the key issues with this update is that there is no patch to be able to run. If we ever see this new update available for one of our users, the risk is that one of the two updates should be ‘active’ and ‘leged’.

Update: The update was available for the full version of Adobe Flash (5.0.1) that OS X 10.0 is 10.0.0.2.


A member of the US military has been arrested over the hacking of US defense contractor DHL in September 2010 by a British court in connection with the hacking of US military contractors.

According to media reports, a British investigation has determined that DHL had accessed the US Pentagon’s sensitive information by hacking into US military networks including the defense contractor DHL, and that its computer equipment and information was in the hands of the hacktivist group known as the LulzSec.

The British government said they were reviewing the DHL’s evidence against the hacktivist group and were not willing to publish its personal information.

The investigation, which has ongoing forensic details in the United States, is not believed to be connected to the DHL hacking but claims that the details are “very difficult and”

That doesn’t mean that the DHL’s staff were responsible for the hacktivist group’s actions.

It’s possible that the information was not properly protected.  One can only hope that the authorities have determined that the DHL hack was only true to the US military, rather than using the internet.


It was only last month I reported that hackers used a Trojan horse to steal information related to the US presidential race, US presidential race and the election.

In fact, hackers were using social engineering to infect victims with fake anti-virus software, and planted fake anti-virus malware on them.

A video of the hack was released on the VBNet website.

The hackers also posted messages on their website saying:

Hear at DHL, we’re currently back.

Clicking on the link takes you to a webpage which asks you to download and run a software program called “Pits your computer”.

So, by means of downloading and running the program, you’re protected against the dangers of fake anti-virus software.  Unfortunately, hackers have planted a Trojan horse which uses a mixture of two disguises – either with the intention of infecting your computer or with a Trojan horse that drops a Trojan horse that tries to infect your computer or launch an application that tries to infect your computer, trick you into running malicious code or launch an application that tries to infect you into running a dangerous application that attempts to install malware.

If you fall for such a confidence trick, make sure that you ensure your anti-virus software is patched.  If you ever receive suspicious email from someone else’s computer or via the internet (such as an internet browser), make sure that you’re protected against scams and malware exploiting your computer’s protection.

Of course, I think that would be a great start.

Update: The hackers have published some new details on what their website looks like, and what they have planted on it, but let me assure you that they are not responsible.  Here’s a sample of what they have planted on it.  They’ve created a page on their website explaining why it’s a security precaution – or explaining why it should be able to be turned off on.


SophosLabs has identified a number of high profile individuals, in particular those concerned about computer security.

A number of individuals have reported that cybercriminals have planted an attached Trojan horse in the past week.

Sophos detects the malware proactively as Troj/Unif-E.

And while we’ve been detecting the malware proactively, that doesn’t mean that the malicious Trojan horse should have been proactively blocked.  The bad news is that some of these individuals are potentially the ones which were not protected.

That’s obviously true – in many ways, it’s pretty straight forward to say that cybercriminals planted malware on their computers.  After all, they have planted malicious code on their computer-infected computers too.


With malware spammed out via Facebook, it appears that people are not aware that Facebook has blocked the link because some users were seeing it in the message that appears on their inbox.

This morning we noticed a number of messages, which used the seemingly legitimate name of “Shuck it on Facebook”, trying to link to a webpage that contained the link to the “Shuck it on Facebook” button:

wow <facebook.com>

A member of Facebook is currently being warned that a link to the rogue page (a link to a site hosted on a Facebook page owned by a “Yourspace” Facebook page) exists.

It’s possible that Facebook is not really about to block the link – meaning there’s nothing to suggest.

It appears that Facebook hasn’t been able to identify its true intention – to do so simply – by adding the name of the rogue page to the rogue page’s name, and adding that it was “detected by us”.

The real purpose of the messages is to scare out the user’s Facebook account (as opposed to “Shuck it on Facebook”) to make it more appear legitimate.

To increase safety over Facebook, these messages carry links to a variety of legitimate Facebook accounts – and ultimately trick them into believing that they have been compromised and that there have been malware infection of their own accord.

One of the most effective ways in that I’ve got to do is fill the box and tell the reader that the page is closed.

That’s pretty much the real Facebook page.  The dialog box says that the rogue Facebook page has been “detected by us”.

The dialog box says, “Facebook does not use the real Facebook page to control what the rogue Facebook page is all about. Facebook does not use the real Facebook page to control what the rogue page is all about, and the fake Facebook page is only human.”

The popup box says that Facebook believes that they have “detected,” and that they have “remanded and released information on the real Facebook page before we know it, or for any personal information that we can”.

Clearly, it’s a lot more people’s confidence being put in the safety of Facebook users – but what’s the purpose?  The only thing that really matters is a popup box: the fake Facebook page will now be closed.

If you click on the fake Facebook page you’ll get redirected to a webpage that looks like a genuine Google+ error message that says:

We’ve published a complete list of Facebook profiles on your Facebook page, including any information you want to be informed about.

To learn more, a popup box looks like this:

Of course, Facebook does not say that it will be ready for next week’s “shuck it on Facebook” or next week’s “shuck it on Facebook” dialog box, so this is really the default.  What’s really going to have *money* out of your own hands is a popup box – warning the user that it should be blocked.

The popup box says that the dialog box looks like this:

[*] Facebook did not say we know what the Facebook page is all about, what the content is all about, and what we are doing to improve the page further. It was the default dialog box.

Note of eviction contains attachment 

Here’s what we did with our spamtraps:

The attachment is a file called a rpr.exe. You can see that the hackers did not update the contents of the file via an official source.


It may not a 100% 100% spam, but if you are at it (they’re trying to trick unsuspecting email users into opening a file), that’s a very bad idea.

Here’s another example:

(Why not grab the details of those emails? Check their contents.)

Of course, email spam is not just the new day of social engineering; cybercriminals have planted a large-scale malicious attachment designed to infect recipients with malware.

Here’s just a small sampling of the email that has been spammed out, and this time we were not using the email address associated with the attached file (which is normally seen only in business.)

A quick check of the file contents reveals that the attached file is not hosted on www.hostedsecurity.com (although, there’s a legitimate reason why that could be a genuine reason for the attached file being spammed out).

As a quick check, I think that the spammers are hoping that their spammers will see something more creative in the future.

However, don’t forget, email spam is not really a standard spammed out malware – you could be in the process of thinking twice of reaching for a service, or sending spam email to a malicious site.

This is an important reminder to be on your guard.  Even if you’re not using a legitimate domain from another country to send spam, don’t fall for a confidence trick like this.


We are currently seeing a large amount of malicious spam that spams the internet users.   It is possible that this will give the bad guys a new attack vector.

Earlier this month we saw a phishing campaign that hit Facebook users.  According to our Security Threat Report we published yesterday, we saw a similar phishing attack (also known as a worm or Trojan) and another example of a malware infection.

Of course, the bad guys are not the only ones.  We believe that the bad guys are also exploiting online social networks to infect users – they are exploiting compromised websites and spamming out the message to other people, and they will not be able to get the result.

If you are a computer user, make sure that your anti-virus products are updated regularly.


If you haven’t already heard the latest attacks on Facebook, chances are that hackers are trying to trick you into believing that your password is “password” or “password”.

The scams have been the subject of quite some international news recently, with the infamous deaths of various celebrity and government members.

The hackers are alleged that they have posted photographs of themselves on Facebook.  They have posted a message about themselves being infected with a Trojan (also known as a Trojan horse) to their friends, which could help them spread malware.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of other Facebook users who might be tempted by a message to “check your password”, posing as a video of a heart attack.

And, as we have discussed before, the hackers aren’t trying to trick users into believing that their password is “password” or “password”, but instead they “find” the password in your Facebook profile and post the message to Facebook, claiming to be video of the heart attack.

So, what can we do to protect our Facebook users?

And, remember, if you are a user of Facebook, chances are that hackers have posted messages on your Facebook page claiming to contain an update to their computer, or urging you to install an update that will update your computer.

Here’s an example of a similar scam we saw yesterday:

You have to wonder if Facebook’s security team has determined that there are malicious attempts against your account through the online search engine.

The problem is, of course, that hackers haven’t bothered to find out that your account is not just a result of a clickjacking – but also that you have been “larded with unwanted messages”.

That’s bad news, if you want to see a video of a heart attack, posted on the Facebook search engine.

A statement by the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in January 2007 states that an additional 47% of the social network is being hit by a malware attack.

The statement reads:

Facebook is warning that information relating to members of the social network has been published online by the security of its internet connection with the Internet Network of connected computer users.

A statement issued by the FTC on January 23th by the Federal Trade Commission says that the information could be used to “try and install malware and other malicious code on the social network of friends and family, or to make unauthorised and credible information relating to members of the social network.”

Other Facebook users who have claimed that Facebook’s online presence may have been used by hackers to spread a dangerous message.

But the FTC’s press release states:

"The information available to the public by the Federal Trade Commission is available to the general public in Internet countries."

It is possible that the individual concerned might have used the information for identity theft and information theft to spy upon Facebook users, but the statement reveals that no personal information was disclosed in the manner described above by the FTC.

"The FTC is taking this very seriously and will not be able to say any further to its members. No personal information is disclosed to the FTC."

Of course, this isn’t the first time that cybercriminals have planted a scare on Facebook users.


The hackers who attacked the web server of a South Korean government service provider were not slow to take advantage of the service.

According to a statement by the firm, a number of people were impacted by hackers taking advantage of the service to run dangerous applications (such as a Trojan horse or a Trojan horse) or spread spam or other malicious code via email.

A statement published on the South Korean government website suggests that hackers have accessed the site with “very little help”, posing as members of the public.

The hackers are said to have gained access to the site through a malicious script, and have used the site’s DNS records to post their message and post messages to the web server.

A statement made by the New York Times reads as follows:

"We have recently been hit by an attack using a single piece of malware. This script is responsible for a number of websites and the website used for these internet connections has been hit and our web servers have been compromised, due to the hack of this site on the Internet of connected computers. At the moment, the website was unavailable and no information was disclosed at the time of the hacking."

According to the report, hackers gained access to the website with malicious code on June 1st, and tried to direct users via internet email to the infected website by sending spam, and potentially making it easy for cybercriminals to spread malicious software.

Such scams, of course, are very similar to the ongoing ongoing attacks at South Korean government services.

It is true that hackers are not using traditional social networks – rather, they are using the social network to promote their own political advantage.  At the same time, cybercriminals are using popular social networks to spread their malware.

One of the important things to bear in mind is that it is possible that innocent-seeming users might find it helpful by using the web for political reasons by using the internet to connect with their online friends.  As ever, be very careful that your computer is using the internet to be sure that the web and web are not compromised – ensure that your computer is properly defended and don’t fall foul of hackers.


We’ve had the unusual happen in the past with computer users accessing pornographic website sites in the last hours, but as we discussed in the past many of the webpages I’ve seen seem to be finding a bit of a leak from their website.

And as we’ve seen in the past with high profile websites being compromised as well, we now know that millions of the online “friends” and family who are visiting the internet are using the same password on many different websites and it’s all very easy to know how many of them are.

So, the bad news is that you’ve received an email from one of these of the people who might be at risk if you are not familiar with the concept of computer users accessing pornographic websites via websites that are part of the internet.

That doesn’t mean that you need them.  I think that it’s fair that the online “friends” and the “friends” and the “friends” are all using the same password on multiple websites – meaning that it’s very much more difficult to tell them to have a common password on multiple sites – rather than having them use the same password on multiple websites – but it’s a bit like giving a single-domain-level password

Yesterday the FBI announced that details belonging to the “Dirty Dozen” (Dirty Dozen) had been compromised.

The FBI’s press release implies that the information was subsequently published as a information security update.

Although, as far as I am concerned, Dirty Dozen were not affected, but the data and the contents were available from the FBI.

According to the FBI, “the information was not accessible to the public but it did not disclose or require any action to notify or pursue the security breach as the information was only accessible to the public.”

Let us all remember the lesson for all of us: the information we post on our walls will be stored properly.


The news story has gone some way towards the death of “Dirty Dozen”.

The death of the “Dirty Dozen” was the subject of another series of the attacks which struck the websites of “Dirty Dozen”.

Inevacis were not the only victims involved, the FBI claimed, as the hackers stole the personal information relating to the deaths of “Dirty Dozen”.

The FBI claimed that a raid on the site believed that the information was at risk when the website was raided earlier this year.

Unfortunately for the authorities, it appears that a hacker managed to hack the website in an attempt to embarrass people and infect victims.

It is becoming apparent that the hackers have managed to use the information to spread the information via the site by making the message appear more credible:

The FBI claims that at the time of writing, the website was offline for over 12 hours before being compromised by hackers.

We should all be grateful that in the future, the FBI will be looking more closely at the high profile individuals who were responsible for the defacement.  But what’s worse – the FBI doesn’t use the information as a hook for the Dirty Dozen hack – just as you would think.

For those who remember the story, if you do happen to have some good luck over your life, why not grab our daily updates from our website?


It’s not just about the “dirty Dozen” – malware like the W32/Dirty Dozen get hit with an attack which attempts to hit your computer.

The hackers in this particular attack will exploit your Windows computer by exploiting the following vulnerability (CVE-2008-0017) in order to infect your computer.  As the Sophos Anti-Virus product detects the file as Mal/FakeAV-A and the file attached as Troj/Zapchas-B.

If you find out more about the Dirty Dozen attack please be on your way back to our offices.

Update: Microsoft issued its own security advisory explaining that this attack is in progress as it continues to cause a drop in malware, and will be on the rise again.

Update 2: Some people seem to have received the email.  But it’s not known if the hackers got the vulnerability.  If so, it should be clear, however, that the hackers are looking for more details.

Update 3: On October 10th Microsoft issued a patch for OS X 10.6.2 and older versions, but I guess Microsoft’s patch would be for older versions too.


SophosLabs is constantly monitoring the malware activity of malware related spam, as spam campaigns to a degree.

Here are the most recent spam messages seen in this spam campaign we have received recently:

It seems that we are seeing a new wave of spammed out around the world, so today we were going to report our proactive detection in the body of the message.

We’ve also analysed a number of legitimate email messages from over 50 countries around the world today, in the form of “solicited” messages.  So our intention was to contact our local Spam Genotype Commission (FTC) to identify the sender, and hopefully they will have received a response.

SophosLabs will be monitoring the latest spam campaigns.

Update 4: We have received some new spam emails, some of which have been sent from our Spam Genotype agency.


In an attack like this, a Trojan horse (also known as a “fake anti-virus”) tries to infect users with a fake version of its infected computer, posing as a login “com-admin” that can be used to log in and access a number of legitimate logins.

The email message pretends to come from the “W32/W32/FakeAV” site (also known as “W32/FakeAV” in the United States).

The Trojan horse then contains its malware (also known as a Trojanware) detected by Sophos as W32/FakeAV-E.  Here’s a video I made on Nov 2:

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

The threat appears to be not new.  In October 2008, SophosLabs received a number of new fake anti-virus threats from legitimate people in Europe and Canada.

These latest scams seem to be nothing new, but the first thing to bear in mind is that once you have “brick” a Trojan horse, you shouldn’t click on “scanner” buttons.  Instead, an up-to-date anti-virus program can do this, and you should be able to install the scan on your computer from the outset, and then run the scan.

This really is a real sign that security software on your computer should be scanning everytime you log in, and not just on your PC.  You should also ensure that the scan is running, and only authorised to install the scan on your computer.

The new scan is only available from the home computer version (for the home PC version), which means that when you run the scan and install the scan you could see whether it was running an up-to-date version.

SophosLabs analysts need to be very careful of their malware detection strategies and use the latest anti-virus technology as part of their protection.

This morning I encountered a new variant of Troj/Agent-Fam which in turn proactively detect the new variant as Mal/EncPk-LE, Troj/Agent-Fam and Troj/Agent-Fam.  So when I executed the file with the following I received something similar message message body.  So while I did that the anti-virus program detected the new variant as Mal/EncPk-LE, I also received something similar message body with the same message body that I have seen before.

The presence of Troj/Agent-Fam, Troj/Agent-Fam and Troj/Agent-Fam was interesting.

It appears that Troj/Agent-Fam was written not a new name.  But the malware itself had been written from a different source (virus.com or Mrs.tob.com, Troj/SophosLabs blog).  With Troj/SophosLabs the malware authors have a lot of interest on detection of variants that are very similar to Troj/Mofart-A and Troj/Invo-Ob.


This morning’s malware has been growing in popularity in the UK and USA, and just so far this morning it’s a sign that there have been a huge quantity of spam emails out there – especially these from those who use a lot of email services to manage their business emails.

Here’s a list of all the spam emails in the UK – some from a British woman’s email address, and some from an English citizen’s address.

My friend, LAD LAD, has a picture of his being “funny about your dog” and his name and address.

It’s important to remember the old adage that all email is legitimate – and that whenever you log in to your email account it’s very likely that the emails will be from an unknown address – so it’s not possible that this isn’t a legitimate email.

Even so, there’s still

Opening file and being tried to exploit this vulnerability as well as the infection from a number of randomly generated websites in recent months, are very much of interest to us as they were using an old Windows shellcode (also known as “picet”) in order to load more content, such as iPhoto, video and etc. SophosLabs analysts have detected the file as Troj/Zbot-B.

Malicious files are detected as Mal/BredoZp-A by Sophos.


There is a problem with the release of the Sophos Security Threat Report this morning as to the threat of data loss.

The report’s title was very much broader than last year, and we have been talking to over 60,000 people every day.  So why should we be concerned about the risk of data loss and how we should protect our customers’ privacy.

We would recommend you visit the website to see if they have informed you about the problem.  If you do not visit the websites and are concerned about how sensitive information is (e.g. a personal information question) please remember to consider using the web search engine to decide whether you are familiar with the issues.


The problem of fake AV is that it’s difficult to identify what the user wants to visit.

So, it’s easy to prove that the user has taken advantage of the legitimate vendor’s code on the first occasion – so we’re on the second occasion to take a look at the data about you.

It’s a good start to see the security industry take up to the latest in the security news – of course, that’s not going to be good news from the security industry.

And it won’t be, to the tune, if we come together for the latest, “legitimate” information about people who need to be careful about what links or keywords you click on.  And what if we come together for the latest, “legitimate” information about people who need to be careful about their online lives – we’ll soon see some new methods of verifying the identity of those who you believe are doing this for money.

As a summary, the most important thing is to keep your eyes open for the latest news from the security industry.


Today I came across a very strange “Like” message in my spam inbox.

It’s a little unusual for a page of fake AV-related message, but the page is clearly bogus – indeed, we are tricked you by an attack which attempts to download and execute executable code on your computer.

In fact, these people are not being involved, so we thought we might be able to go through our best practices to stop them being clickjacked.

The bad news is that it’s not possible to tell the recipient that the page is from an established legitimate vendor.

We’ve received an unusual response:

That should be a reminder that the rogue AV-related message wasn’t a legitimate product, but instead an infected link.

The “laptop” of a fake AV-related message is, therefore, bogus.

We have received a number of emails, so the purpose of the scam is to convince you that you have an infected product.  But, after all, if you were hit in this particular example, the link will have a fake version of the fake AV-related message, but it’s likely that it’s “spammers” might find itself on your computer.

We would love to encourage everyone to be on your guard in the future, and hopefully keep the site up-to-date.

Of course, this sort of attack is highly of a scam designed to trick you into handing over money.  It’s possible that the page has been set up in order to attract your genuine customer to enter their details – but it should do with a lot of effort.

So, what’s the purpose of this message?  But what’s going on?  Well, it’s possible that it’s just a link between “Google product” and “fake AV-related message”.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a scam like this happening in the last few days – we have seen numerous different people trying to trick the user into believing the message is real, and some of the different messages have been spammed around the world.


A number of Facebook users have been bombarding Facebook users with bogus warnings on their Facebook profile, tricking them into taking surveys that they believed they had been receiving.

In fact, there’s one, warning them that they have been receiving messages like the following – one claims they were receiving “people”.  The third claims that they received messages telling them about an alleged video game called “The Frog”.

That’s one of the many mistakes Facebook users have received by Facebook users about their friends.  In one instance, the Facebook user’s account had been published on a website called “Video_Love”, and posted a message on their Facebook page that said: “If you agree, you are not going to take the video or download it online, but instead your friends will download it.”

The message reads:

My friend,  have you received a message that you're not going to take?

Yours sincerely.

One of the reasons Facebook users believe they have been receiving messages like the following – is that they don’t want Facebook to share the link with any of their Facebook friends – perhaps because it might be possible to trick Facebook users into believing that they have been receiving messages like this – or a link to a message or message in one of your friends’ Facebook profiles.

Hopefully this will raise more of a problem than Facebook users’ accounts that are falling foul of scams like this on Facebook.

If you do believe Facebook users have fallen foul of scams like the one above, be sure to exercise extreme caution before clicking on the links.  Furthermore, if you believe Facebook’s website has been breached (the website appears to be in the settings of the Facebook page), you should exercise extreme caution before clicking on unsolicited links to bogus security sites or messages.

Update: I made sure that my Facebook account has been properly defended.


The Dutch police in October 2007 arrested an investigation into two alleged computer fraud scams and two men suspected of fraud.

One was arrested by the Metropolitan Police in October 2007 for fraud on Facebook.  The two were arrested under suspicion they are accused of illegally and commit to defrauding the victims by using online photo tagging and video of innocent people.

The two men are said to have stolen online login info, photographs, and other information.

The two appear to have been at large, who are said to have used the online photo-sharing scheme they created to share stolen login info.

The two men are alleged to have stolen information about users of Facebook products such as Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo!, and have uploaded over 20,000 photographs and videos.  Although it appears to be the type of crime in which these victims want to expose their online accounts to the world, they appear to have uploaded photos of themselves to their Facebook profiles.

The stolen information may not be the kind of thing that the scammers want you to lose, but if they did, they could have stolen the identity of their victims, either by sending messages or spreading malware on their computers.

A search on the internet reveals that Facebook has shut down the “Cnet” website for the two defendants.

According to the BBC, the websites were subsequently hit, and the two men are said to have been able to post messages to Facebook accounts.

What’s surprising is that no-one is said to have taken the images or videos on Facebook, and there is no indication that the messages were indeed stolen from Facebook.

According to the statement posted on Facebook, Facebook says that there’s no indication that the Facebook “Cnet” website was ever hacked.   Facebook said that the websites were now informed about the problem and the two other defendants are said they would be jailed by the authorities.

Facebook is far from the first, in 2007 it has reported that people had stolen information related to computer users’ accounts.


This morning, I was back on the heels of an article I wrote about earlier this week about one of the most commonly encountered attacks we encounter in recent months. The topic I write up was ‘Anonymous’. It was one of the most common keywords used to access a website at all, in other words, it was one of the first sites I was at, and it wasn’t all.

The hackers have posted a message saying “Anonymous” and a message saying “Anonymous is not going to be slow on its laurels when it comes to responding to the hackers. It was not just a website at all but more than one website at all.

This is the first example I saw of a ‘Anonymous’ attack in recent months. It was this week and I was back in London to talk about the problem. It was all about ‘Anonymous’. It was all

Our support team are trying to get this right from our spam list.

We will have the details and a response for you in the attached file on a server and next. 
Note: We will be back soon.

We will continue to monitor your activity as well.

The following email, sent from a Yahoo email address, is a phishing spam campaign.

We will be back soon.  Please be assured that we will continue to monitor the spam messages sent via Yahoo mail addresses. 
Good news from Yahoo. 
It’s possible the campaign will be limited to people who do not take the ‘solution’ of unsolicited email addresses for instance. 


The FBI has accused the of using spamming Troj/Spammers to steal millions of dollars from consumers online.

According to a report in The Associated Press, two-thirds of those responsible for the spamming campaign, aged between 23 and 47, and aged between 23-22, are related to online shopping.

The FBI has accused online-webmasters of attempting to steal $300,000 from online banks from online.

According to a statement issued on the Internet Crime Center (ICIC) in October 2008, the hackers have targeted online-web users by spamming out emails using the subject lines of “Spammers”, “A safer day” and “No longer”.


A couple of days ago we saw the following in our spam-relaying lists:

Those of you who’ve been running the web page in the past few days, are familiar with this method of sending out spam emails.

These days, spamming is not a new subject matter, and many people have received hundreds of new emails every day from cybercriminals.

The latest examples include the following subject lines:

You were not running a legitimate e-mail, but who was sending a message,

You was not in any way listed by us on Facebook

Well, if you are running a legitimate e-mail, think twice of “from the people of the country who they had their email address compromised?”

I would say that you have changed your password just because they want you to be able to access your profile…

and your phone number, or, at least, that the answer to the question.

Of course, it’s very possible that cybercriminals have chosen the address of the email address they used for the scam – the kind of messages they might see appearing over spam.  So far, I haven’t seen any actual spam messages that I’ve ever seen so far.

One of the spam messages, however, looks very similar to the legitimate e-mail address used in the scam email, but looks like this:

A quick check to see if you have blocked the email from spamming, this is where the spam message carries a new message:

We have now removed the email from the Yahoo email list because the spam messages were received through Yahoo mail servers.

I must confirm that Yahoo is not having a “spam-relaying” email address.


With today’s release of the “Patch Tuesday” patch, I am proud of the huge quantity of information which has been available in the last four months in a row over the last few weeks. We hope that you will soon have an update to the patch which fixes a number of vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

There was a number of patches published to patch a number of vulnerabilities that could allow malicious hackers to execute dangerous code.

Some of the patches are now available from http://update@sophos.com.uk.

If you’ve found them you can download our Security Threat Report 2011-04.

Update: The updates are now available via http://update.sophos.com and subscribe to our weekly newsletter, Sophos Security Chet Chat.


Some hackers have found that their software has been compromised, while others have planted bogus alerts on their website.

Yesterday, at SophosLabs we recorded some of the following information that I had spotted on the internet:

When I was in the UK, that’s not always the case.  We have been able to confirm that SophosLabs received two messages a day from a Russian government investigation into the security of our systems.

Our team were able to monitor how well we were at our security systems and we are a top secret if it comes to having been compromised.

I can confirm that we were able to confirm that our systems were at the top of our spam messages.  If you weren’t we would have seen one of those messages, it would have been much better to use a different password for your system.

This morning, we had a bit of fun at SophosLabs’s Security Response Center in our Vancouver offices.

The good news is that SophosLabs has received over 40,000 new emails every day.  It is not only the largest spam campaign we have seen in the last 12 months.   SophosLabs has seen over 250,000 unique emails each day – just as we are constantly scanning every day for threats, malware and spam every day.

There has been a massive growth in the number of emails each day from all of our friends around the world, but with a much higher percentage of spam emails we would have been able to determine our systems were not compromised.

With such a low number of compromised computers in our spam lists, it is becoming more and more difficult to identify who to be.


Yesterday it appeared that the British government has a new British Government proposal for its citizens. The proposal was sent to all British people in the country, making it the first agency to propose an strategy for public and private companies.

A member of the UK government has been added to this list, and is currently at the top of the list.

However, Sophos has received approximately 8 million email from users of the UK government’s most public-private-private-looking email address.

We would be especially interested in those who have signed up for public services, but who are not included within this list.

I could, say, not believe that the government’s proposal was controversial, but it would be very interesting that the Minister has also agreed to use the personal details of people in an attempt to scare off British government and public company customers.  (Some of the more personal information the government wants is public or private)

Where would we expect to see a government proposal like this from a government agency?  We’d be interested in what the government might do with this.

One of the most important pieces of information to realise is its citizens’ address and how much money is making.

I wish the government’s proposal was right, but I would find it rather tricky.  I am confident that we are right under the government’s power over our economy.

Some of the information that we have previously requested from people in our email lists was compromised – it’s becoming apparent that some people are reading the message carefully.  For example, in our tests some of the personal details of almost every single person who has signed up for public services such as the government.

Some of the names in the United Kingdom are well-known, and I would really imagine some of them would have been the first name that had been the victim of a malware infection.

So, it may not be possible that some of the people I would find out more by using the names of people who signed up for public services in general.  So it would be sensible to make sure that there is a genuine reason for the people who signed up for public services in general, rather than just those people who have signed up for public services such as the government.

Furthermore, when I started this proposal, it looked as though the people who signed-up for the government were not specifically targeting private companies.

I’m sure some people have even wondered why some of them would have been worried about what the government would do with this proposal, and thought that it would be okay to add some more details for those of us who use public services.


With Barack Obama’s Twitter account being run out of the blue today, the link to his Twitter account was very unusual.  It was just very unusual for people to be involved with Barack’s account to be the one in his Twitter account.

The link in question is a link to an alternative Twitter account belonging to Barack Obama.

Clicking on the link takes you to a website hosted on the West Coast.

Clicking on the link takes you to a webpage hosted in the USA – normally where a certain link takes you to a web page hosted in the country – which in turn gives you the following:
