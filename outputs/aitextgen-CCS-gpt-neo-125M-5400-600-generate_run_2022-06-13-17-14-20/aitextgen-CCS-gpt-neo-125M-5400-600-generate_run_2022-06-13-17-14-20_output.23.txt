The Firewall application checks the Firewall application provided with this post as well as detecting the problem via an up-to-date version of Firewall and a checksum to detect the problem as it is detected.

The Firewall application was detected by Firewall as Mal/Download-E.

Since Firewall was initially found on a number of websites related to Firewall, we were able to identify the user. We then received two questions. The first was an application that had been downloaded from http://getances.org

The second question was an “Sophos” that was downloaded from http://getances.org

The Firewall application has a list of files downloaded from http://getances.org. So it is an indication that these files are potentially malicious.

The Firewall application detects the downloaded file as W32/Dloadr-A and does not use a special filename as the file is opened.

It has been detected as W32/Autorun-Gen. The Firewall application was detected as W32/Dloadr-A after downloading, and we have been able to detect that the downloaded file in question as Troj/Dloadr-A since it was relatively early as the Firewall was initially released and a lot of people downloaded and downloaded from http://getances.org

We would recommend that not to open up the app to ensure that the Firewall application was not malicious.


One of the things that I have been a bit of this week with web browsers was ‘cleaning’ and ‘cleanting’. When I first analysed the fake anti-virus that was ‘cleaning’ it’ it seemed like it was ‘cleaning’.

But that wasn’t the case at all. When I saw the fake anti-virus ‘cleaning’ on my PC I saw that it was still active in the fake anti-virus. And the fake anti-virus really was just just annoying. It was detected as W32/Autorun-G in the form of Mal/Zbot-B. When I got it that was still active as the program started, but the fake anti-virus was actually quite active as it was. So I was very suspicious of this fake anti-virus and it seemed like I was very suspicious.

I was suspicious of fake anti-virus scams like ‘scanning’. It was fairly obvious to me that they’re real fake anti-virus scams. It was clear to me that they’re real threats. The first thing I really like about the ‘cleaning’ dialog box was the usual Fake AV. It was, of course, a fake anti-virus that was a little bogus, especially for legitimate anti-virus software which really was not real security software.

When I ran this fake anti-virus in a real PC I would think that the fake anti-virus really had been really legitimate.  What was actually true is, it seems that the fake anti-virus software didn’t just actually install and run a real anti-virus to infect some of the fake anti-virus products, but also actually was installed to run a fake anti-virus program on my PC, not just from a genuine anti-virus software.

The fake anti-virus was just installed and ran on my computer.  What was interesting is that it turned the fake anti-virus software on my PC.

The fake anti-virus software only had the following registry key:

* The fake anti-virus software should automatically ‘clean’ the anti-virus programs on my PC. When I saw fake anti-virus programs I was immediately redirected to a site. But that isn’t it.

* The fake anti-virus software was detected as Mal/FakeAV-E. The fake anti-virus program was detected as W32/Spy-A as well.

* The fake anti-virus software downloaded from http://getances.org.com was legitimate. But, when I tried it, it tried and executed a program in the following window:

* The fake anti-virus program starts:

* The fake anti-virus software downloaded from http://getances.org. It really was legitimate. You see the fake anti-virus program.

* The fake anti-virus program downloaded from http://getances.org.

* The fake anti-virus software downloaded from http://getances.org.

* The fake anti-virus software downloaded from http://getances.org.

* The fake anti-virus program starts automatically logging on and running when the infected computer is turned on, but you will see a message saying “Don”. It's an awful lot more than just a registry key.

* The fake anti-virus software downloaded from http://getances.org

* The fake anti-virus program starts:

* The fake anti-virus software starts:

* The fake anti-virus software starts:

* The fake anti-virus program starts by copying the contents of the registry key to a drive in the computer to see that it is switched on. The fake anti-virus program starts off.

* The fake anti-virus program starts, not only from http://getances.org but also from http://getances.org

* The fake anti-virus software starts:

* The fake anti-virus program starts by copying the contents of the registry key (i’.e. the registry key) to the C: drive and every time the computer is switched on.

* The fake anti-virus software starts to boot up.

* The fake anti-virus program starts the fake anti-virus software ‘cleaning’. But it was, and after all, a fake anti-virus program. This is a scam, and in fact it seems to have been created in the form of a fake anti-virus program.

* The fake anti-virus program starts by automatically logging on again and again.

* The fake anti-virus program starts automatically logging on again and again. The fake anti-virus software starts by checking for the version of the Trojan it will come up with. But it only checks the version in question, which it will never visit, and in the case of fake anti-virus programs, the password is “Solution”.

* The fake anti-virus software starts to boot, and its true fake anti-virus program starts at 5:00. So that really is a scam and malware. So that really was fake anti-virus software, or in fact it was all a fake anti-virus product.

* The fake anti-virus software starts ‘cleaning’. And the fake anti-virus software starts ‘cleaning’. So, if you have fake anti-virus software you can log back on the fake anti-virus software again. So by looking at the fake anti-virus software you can log back on the fake anti-virus software you are effectively running up-to-date with the installation date.

* The fake anti-virus program starts. The fake anti-virus program starts by automatically logging in again and again.

* The fake anti-virus software starts again. This really is fake anti-virus software. So that really is fake anti-virus software. So that really is fake anti-virus software.

* The fake anti-virus software starts with ‘cleaning’. So what? He’s not really actually a real anti-virus product at all, so he needs a password password. He needs to enter his password in order to get the password. He needs to enter his password to get the password. He needs a password before this is even valid, and after entering his password. He needs a password on the password it is difficult to crack. He needs a password on the password. He needs a dictionary word. He needs a dictionary word. He needs a dictionary word.

We saw a variant of the infamous Zlob malware today.

When we first looked into the Zlob malware, the malware authors were clearly looking for new ways of hiding malware.

SophosLabs has recently published its annual technical paper “Securing an Attack Network”. This paper joined us with Paul Baccas and myself discussing some of the growing number of malicious web attacks and the recent interest in social networks having their personal information stolen.

It would be a busy week for a couple of the experts in the Zlob family of threats, and with the number of variants we encounter each day, it will be very difficult to determine the true true malicious activity.

On Friday, March 8th, we had a discussion about the high profile website defacements and the potential for identity theft.

The website defaced with images of the Zlob family of threats is one of the biggest high profile sites we have seen in recent weeks.

The number of unique identities is a prime indication of the current situation for any organization targeted by Zlob malware.  Although Zlob family of threats is growing, this is the number one site that needs more protection.

We’ll have to put more effort into the Zlob family of threats in future.  The number one is a little higher than the number one for those of the people who suffered from a Zlob attack.

So, it’s important to keep the number one site relatively low.  If you haven’t already done so, please do visit our website.

It’s important that all organisations use encryption techniques to clean up their personal information.  Make sure that you have chosen decent security settings, a hard-to-crack encryption, a non-spam anti-spam scanner, and a strong encryption with a strong encryption and the latest anti-virus software.


If you’re a computer user, I’ve just added another bit of security to that blog post.  The Naked Security team blogged about some of the more interesting and relevant security related stories from the week of Patch Tuesday.

This morning’s entry into SophosLabs published a blog post about the month of Patch Tuesday.

I thought it was an excellent day for the month in which security experts blogged about some of the more interesting vulnerabilities in Windows, Internet Explorer and Office.

There’s a good news for all of us – if you haven’t yet had a test drive for yourself, read the full story of Patch Tuesday here and download the Sophos Security Chet Chat.

We’ll also have a recording on January 9th to discuss whether the month was a busy week, and the other month’s updates are also available.

All of the SophosLabs bloggers are currently members of the National Public Conference – I don’t know if it’s true but it would be great if you had a listening programme for “Patch Tuesday”.

Let’s all know what you think of what’s going on here.

Microsoft has released a patch for Windows XP SP2, the latest version of the Microsoft Flash Player, for Windows XP SP2 SP2.

According to Microsoft, hackers are able to infect a victim’s machine with malware.  So if your computer is infected by malware, you might be able to install a Trojan horse that has been seen, and will run potentially dangerous programs.

Sophos have published a technical YouTube video where they explain how hackers can infect Windows XP SP2 users.

Here’s an update from Microsoft that describes the vulnerabilities in Windows XP SP2 SP2, Microsoft has published a statement that can be found in their website.

There’s plenty of talk of how Windows Vista SP2 can be exploited by hackers – although most of them claim that there is no fix for an issue on its own Windows XP SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP2 SP3 SP3 SP6 SP1 SP2 SP6 SP7 SP7 SP3 SP5 SP3 SP6 SP1 SP4 SP7 SP6 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP5 SP5 SP1 SP5 SP9 SP4 SP1 SP5 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP5 SP7 SP4 SP2 SP4 SP5 SP4 SP6 SP5 SP4 SP7 SP9 SP4 SP4 SP6 SP7 SP1 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP4 SP6 SP1 SP5 SP4 SP1 SP4 SP9 SP4 SP4 SP0 SP4 SP4 SP4 SP3 SP6 SP9 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP9 SP6 SP7 SP0 SP6 SP4 SP6 SP3 SP1 SP8 SP4 SP5 SP5 SP1 SP7 SP1 SP6 SP5 SP5 SP2 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP5 SP5 SP3 SP6 SP1 SP4 SP6 SP3 SP3 SP4 SP9 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP8 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP3 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP4 SP4 SP0 SP4 SP1 SP9 SP4 SP3 SP1 SP8 SP3 SP7 SP1 SP1 SP5 SP5 SP1 SP4 SP7 SP1 SP8 SP4 SP8 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP8 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP9 SP1 SP4 SP6 SP4 SP4 SP5 SP8 SP1 SP0 SP8 SP4 SP1 SP6 SP9 SP9 SP5 SP1 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP5 SP8 SP7 SP1 SP4 SP4 SP6 SP4 SP1 SP4 SP6 SP1 SP3 SP1 SP3 SP9 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP6 SP8 SP6 SP1 SP2 SP1 SP6 SP3 SP6 SP3 SP5 SP4 SP1 SP5 SP1 SP5 SP5 SP3 SP1 SP5 SP4 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP8 SP8 SP1 SP8 SP6 SP1 SP9 SP1 SP3 SP1 SP4 SP9 SP5 SP4 SP1 SP6 SP5 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP8 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP5 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP3 SP4 SP1 SP8 SP1 SP4 SP5 SP3 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP5 SP5 SP5 SP1 SP4 SP4 SP8 SP1 SP6 SP3 SP1 SP1 SP6 SP4 SP9 SP1 SP1 SP8 SP1 SP5 SP1 SP5 SP7 SP0 SP4 SP5 SP9 SP1 SP8 SP3 SP4 SP5 SP1 SP4 SP2 SP1 SP8 SP1 SP1 SP5 SP1 SP1 SP9 SP3 SP1 SP4 SP9 SP1 SP3 SP8 SP1 SP7 SP1 SP4 SP9 SP9 SP1 SP3 SP3 SP5 SP1 SP6 SP3 SP3 SP1 SP4 SP0 SP4 SP1 SP3 SP1 SP8 SP5 SP1 SP3 SP1 SP1 SP7 SP1 SP0 SP1 SP9 SP9 SP3 SP7 SP4 SP8 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP3 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP6 SP4 SP4 SP1 SP7 SP0 SP9 SP2 SP4 SP6 SP1 SP5 SP6 SP1 SP0 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP6 SP3 SP1 SP4 SP7 SP1 SP4 SP6 SP2 SP5 SP1 SP4 SP6 SP8 SP1 SP3 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP8 SP8 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP6 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP9 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP5 SP3 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP4 SP4 SP5 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP6 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP5 SP1 SP5 SP1 SP1 SP9 SP1 SP2 SP4 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP2 SP6 SP8 SP1 SP7 SP3 SP1 SP1 SP4 SP6 SP2 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP4 SP1 SP9 SP1 SP5 SP4 SP6 SP3 SP5 SP8 SP4 SP1 SP6 SP3 SP1 SP4 SP

The original Firewall TSO Enterprise file was used to spoof the certificate authority associated with the attack – meaning that the attacker was able to steal information related to the attack, without having to the knowledge that the user was involved in the attack.

This is important because the malicious hacker has not been able to access the database.


One of the questions that I have been asked to question over this morning [1,2] has a subject line of ‘Fascinating in the United States.’

One of the things that was highlighted was the subject line of “Fascinating in the United States.”

I am pleased. What do they say? Well, my first thought was a little more of a bit of an error. The last thought was to read the small text in the email with no problems. I had read the small text here [3] before but I don't have a small bit of imagination [4]

As well as the details, I spent the first thought on the subject line to try to view the original file. (The second thought was the subject line. The last thought was an attachment with no problems.) The second thought was that the source line had been copied to the same URL as the malicious hackers, with no file protection.

The only reason for this was the file that was loaded during the malware attack was in the source line. If the victim was not running a new version of Windows, they were not the first file to get the file.

The file that was loaded was not in any way malicious, and it is possible that there was the file with no file protection in place, with the files loaded from all of the other websites (in fact, not from any other website). It certainly would seem like an odd file as a result of the file with no file protection. So in this case, I was thinking that it was the same file as the malicious hackers. I am not aware that the file from a website was so malicious.

What I haven't received yet was the file of the malicious hacker’s choosing [1] and “Fascinating in the United States.” [2]

I am pleased.

So, if you haven’t seen the following files in the wild, you do need to update your Firewall or the new Firewall/File Execution Protection technology that protects against it.

Last month the British House of Commons received an e-mail with a random number and a random number in the text (the email address was “U”) so what will you do if you click?

Today saw a message with the following error message (click here for a quick summary):

A quick search of the internet results identified that the email address of the address number of a British scientist has been changed, meaning that a random number might be in the message.

The following picture shows how the address of the person sending the e-mail is changed, implying that the email address of the address number has been changed, or that the account has changed.

In a similar view, the computer in question has changed, in the same picture as the address.

I am really surprised that a new e-mail address – in the name of the person sending the e-mail – was sent to a new address by an e-mail address such as the address numbers.  It’s pretty unfortunate that there was so many people sending this e-mail address – even if it had been the one sending the address number of the e-mail address the e-mail address was changed.

A man has admitted to stealing a database for the US Army, that was sent to a Canadian hospital and held on March 25th, 2010.

The man has been named by the British authorities as Craig Matthew Ghand of the Virginia State Department for the Northern District.

This is the first time that a man has been jailed for stealing the database of US Army servers and US Army customers.

This case of the US Army has come as a wake for the ongoing investigation of a potential hacker.

According to The Daily Mail, a 23-year-old man has admitted to leaking information about their employees’ computers, and threatened them with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

According to The Daily Mail, the hacker – known as “Operationpoint One” – claims that he was able to access a number of US military websites to steal information about US Navy personnel including names, addresses and phone numbers, including names, phone numbers, addresses and addresses of students.

The US authorities claim that the man has admitted to stealing a large amount of information including “spider phone numbers, email addresses, and postal codes”.

So, it is unclear whether this is a new attack on the US Army or a new attack on the US Army website.

The newspaper quoted the source:

"Clearly the government did not take this at face value, but rather at face value, a DDoS attack against the US military website [...], and at least its website was accessible to everybody else by the US authorities. So we are still looking at the details of this case, and will see the full details soon. But I am not going to be proven guilty of that, although in the future I will be put off a raid and put the entire US military and the US Army into the dark."

The Daily Mail report claims that the US authorities also found evidence that the man was using SQL injection exploits to post offensive messages, spread spam and spread spam to US Army websites.

If you hear that the attack against US Army is now being discussed, the Register reported on the case on April 7th.

According to the Daily Mail, the firm’s executive published a statement on the website of former director Robert Ghandon, who revealed that he was planning to launch a DDoS attack against the website and gave that the firm was “completely blocking the internet from being struck by this attack [and] its members remain at risk and it will remain accessible to the general public and businesses who remain high on the internet from the future.”

Ghandon is alleged to have used the DDoS attack to damage websites in 12 US military networks to launch the DDoS attack.

According to The Daily Mail, Ghandon’s press release states that the US government believes that “the DDoS attack succeeded in effectively disruption and disrupted the Pentagon’s infrastructure [for] major security purposes.”

But the Register reports that Ghandon’s defence was not a “human attack”, and that an American authorities had used the internet for “approximately 30 hours to launch a DDoS attack against the US government”.

There’s speculation that Ghandon was responsible for the DDoS attack against US Army websites.

The Register reports that Ghandon has now been ordered to pay $5,000 in the next two weeks, making $8,000 a day.

Let’s not forget, that is not a proper explanation.  The Register reports that Ghandon has pleaded guilty to his part.

The Register reports that Ghandon is said to have been a “human”, having committed illegal activity against the US military.

The Register reports that Ghandon was also ordered to pay $6,000 in the next two years.

According to the Register, Ghandon has taken part in a DDoS attack against the US government’s website – but not its website.

The Register reports that Ghandon’s now-famous Director of Defense William Lynn admitted that a DDoS attack against the US government was not only illegal – but is also illegal to the United States.

That’s a real problem for US military computers which are struck by DDoS attacks against the US government.  If you were involved in this crime on January 13, you could be more interested in learning more about the security of your PC.

The Register reports that Ghandon’s now-famous CEO, Nick Lynn, admitted making a statement to the US authorities.

Meanwhile, the Register reports that Ghandon has been ordered to pay $8,000.

In a statement to the US authorities, Lord Ghandon is accused of “enemies” and was ordered to pay $8,000 a day – at which point, the alleged hacker will be jailed for two years.

It’s pretty straight forward to say that Ghandon has not been jailed for two years after being found guilty of making a DDoS attack on US government websites.

I think it’s okay to complain about a case like this – and hopefully we will see more and more in the future.

You can read more about the case in the Register and the United States on the Register and in the United States on the KrebsOnSecurity blog.


Over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of reports that the Facebook worm (also known as “zapchas”) has hit users’ Facebook accounts.

A typical user could find out that their Facebook account has been compromised, or have been hit by hackers in their attack.

The danger is that Facebook has been hit with the message “We believe that your account has been compromised by cybercriminals in this way”, and will have to provide proper protection against the threat.


The last few weeks we have seen spamming around for our friends and family this morning, I thought we could do a quick WHOIS search to see if there was any more spam spam.

The spammer claims that when he received a message from another user, he saw a number of different messages, all from Facebook. He was able to access the messages with the names of all of these profiles – so he could see them again.

So it looks like the bad guys are in greater interest in the spammer’s account’s account, but I have found it. It’s easy to believe that some of the accounts are in fact the same, and I have a number of personal information in one of my accounts.

I have a feeling of relief that I am not going to take a quick, hard-to-crack personal online account – I am not going to give them any access to that account if you have been logged in.

I was hoping that I could see my personal information being used for spamming too much, if that does not make me one of the “entrants” in his Facebook account, my full date of birth (if I am a member, that could make me a little too busy) and some personal information too. This is the only reason I am interested in being a member. This is the first time that Facebook has been hit.

I can confirm that I am not a member of Facebook, but I am really interested to see if I have my personal information and have never used my full date of birth to post it. This is another reason I am not interested in any particular email address, but it is important to confirm my identity.

It is unclear to me if Facebook is having a silver lining, if there is much more spam and spam than Facebook, it is possible that it might be the work of a spammer trying to break into my account that has been compromised.


Today we have seen two emails purporting to be from a friend of hers.

First, the messages claim that someone has created the account to post pictures of her children. This message claims to be from a “Personal” Facebook account. Next, the email claims that someone has created a “User account”, and posted photos of her children on Facebook. But it doesn’t seem like a legitimate photo. The link to the message in the message

Greetings from the Silly Dow Who website.

Earlier today we got a few samples of the spam email messages we were seeing during the week.  The recipients were happy to use the spam messages and were assured that they had not been compromised by malware.  They could receive a variety of other scams on their behalf, ranging from the form of scareware to the money mule fraud.

Here are the characteristics of the email that the users of those who sent the spam messages are seeing:

The messages, in which case the recipient was not a “from”, typically contain text relating to the “from” name, in which the content of the message includes the recipient’s email address. The email address for the recipient is a valid US domain and the number used to send it.

The domain of the messages is used in to deliver the spam messages and the messages being used is set for the spam messages.


I am a little late to the end of January.

We do not get spam emails, but from a spam email attachment we can receive. The spammers are using the form of a scam email:

The file attached to the messages is of the nature of the email message. The message attachment looks like this:

Here is an expected result of this spam message:

We do not get spam emails, but from a spammers perspective the email message is pretty much the same. It is a good mail for the spammers – the email messages have all been delivered from spam mail servers.

The body of the message is:

Of course this email spam message does not contain any spam message content, however, a “from” domain was used in this email campaign. It was sent to the recipients’ accounts and they’re now on the spamming site.

If you spam out the message you will see:

The address is: a domain with a.com domain, and that is in the name of the spam message. The domain is registered to a domain in 2007. This domain is a valid US domain (there is a.com domain used for this domain). However, if you send the email you will be a very suspicious as the address is not correct, however.


A quick search through our spamtraps finds that our spamtraps have a lot of spam emails. All they need is to take a closer look at our spam email and remove the spam message. The only reason I am sending my messages has been because the messages have been removed from our spamtrap content (for example, to stop the spam message from getting sent to me). The message is more different from our spamtrap spam messages, the content is quite different.

The spammers aren’t doing anything more than removing the spam message, and the attached ZIP file, not the main one. It just wants to “view the video” as this video message is, it’s a lot of different subjects.

The spam message is sent using email address www: @picspicsgreetings.com.

We’re on the latest spamming campaigns, with some new spams spreading in the future.  We’re currently detecting the latest messages as spam, pro-spam and pop-up ad spam.  The second spam message we receive (from “PicspicsGreetings.com”) is the subject line, and the subject lines used are the usual of email and social engineering.


Our email inbox got in touch this week. The spam messages are not just the spam messages that went on around the globe – they have actually seen messages from people you haven’t heard before, and have actually been sent in the past.

What’s going on is a message that went out to some folks as we were seeing:

Subject:

This is attached file called e-mail.zip

 body:

From:

Message body:

Good day from our office.

You would need to save some files attached, and if we were so generous (the name of the file attachment was not as we originally promised), please wait an error!

Good day from our office.

Good day from our office.

We're sorry.


SophosLabs analysts received suspicious reports in the form of an SMS-related spam messages. One of the reasons for the messages was because the spammer’s message was spammers’ spammer “Called Called A Spammers”, and the spammers’ messages were being sent out to users.

If you received the messages you’ll find you are redirected to a rogue anti-virus site in your town. If you do get the messages you are taken to an alternative site.

So, what will happen?

*Called A Spammers’ – the website says that you’ll have to buy a number of different anti-virus products from their site. The number is, in fact, different from the original anti-virus. The number is:

*Called A Spammers’ – an online survey that offers you a unique ID to an address you’ll need.

*Called A Spammers’ – which I’ve been able to find on its website – is a randomly generated survey, as I’ve tried to access the site using the legitimate web address:

*Called A Spammers’ – a random number.

*Called A Spammers’ – this email is a randomly generated survey. It asks you to submit a single member’s name, full date and current email address, and if you give the address in the message, the link is taken to a different location.

*Called A Spammers’ – to make sure that you have a legitimate Facebook page. It’s a very similar spam message to another “Called A Spammers” survey. It does exactly this – you receive the email and send it to a remote server.

*Called A Spammers’ – this email is a randomly generated survey. It will cost you money if you don’t get the spam message. If you don’t get the spam message, make sure that your computer is kept up-to-date. If you do receive the email, make sure that you have kept the security systems up-to-date, and keep your wits about you.

*Called A Spammers’ – the website claims you have won a “handling fee”. This will, in turn, help you win an “card for the money” prize. This, in turn, will help you win.

*Called A Spammers’ – this email says that if you do receive an email, you’ll be given a “handling fee”. This will hopefully mean that if your account’s spammers have broken into your account, you won’t be able to win any “card.”

*Called A Spammers’ – the site claims you have won an “AT”, and asks you to hand over your personal details (such as your full date, your full date, and your phone number) before the spam message can be sent. This is all a bit much trickery, as many spam messages have a “handling fee” – and the “handling fee” should be the sort of “card.”

*Called A Spammers – the email, which does not originate from a single individual, claims that you have won a “handling fee” and has received a “handling fee”. You can see the Spammers’ spam messages from the recipient’s inbox:

*Called A Spammers – the email claims that you have won a “handling fee”, presumably in an attempt to make the message seem more believable, but hasn’t convinced the sender’s recipient. And don’t forget, there’s nothing much particularly clever about getting an email to a “handling fee”.

*Called A Spammers – the spam messages don’t just say that the email got sent, but actually sent it to a number of people.

*Called A Spammers – the email addresses are randomly and randomly, and so the spam messages haven’t been sent.  And don’t forget – if you receive an email, please never reply to the text message, and not reply to the email messages.  And don’t forget – this spam message is genuine.

*Called A Spammers – the email address – is not the only “ communication” that will cause the spam message to appear even more nifty.

*Called A Spammers’ – this email claims that the email address and the

We’ve come back from the “get it” of the Sophos Security Threat Report which we’ve been made available recently.

We had a very very quiet day for SophosLabs, but we all have something to lose when it comes to detecting malware and spamming Trojans. The last few weeks we started seeing over 20,000 new spam. The last few weeks there was a big shift that was in line with the number of new spam and the number of new threats.

Over 20,000 new users had received spam, and that is exactly what the amount of spam and malware attacks we had seen in our spamtraps.

So, if you wish, don’t click on the “Free Download” button. If you wish you might see a message stating “Download is free”.

That’s the only spam we had seen and I am not going to send any spam. In fact, just because you “get it”, isn’t necessarily the spammer’s “ offering,” but it may be from the scammers’ own site.

Here’s an example. If you receive an email message from someone else, you should consider using SophosLabs’s own team of threat analysts to be very careful of the email threats spreading fast across your organization.

As we’ve done over the past few weeks we’ve been seeing some new attacks.

We’re in the form of a new Trojan, and hopefully the spammer will already take some time to clean the attached file, though. Perhaps you might notice that as soon as you do click on the link from the download page, your first thought would be to visit a legitimate site such as a web forum.

We won’t be back soon here this time, but we should all be grateful for the people who made the mistake of installing our software, so there’s a message to them too.


The spammers have been on a sharp rise recently, spreading the name of the victims.

It’s an interesting example of social engineering trick which we saw recently.

A typical email looks like this:

The email looks like this:

The email looks similar to the typical example that we have seen before:

The recipient ID[random number]

and the email message body contains the URL www.redcross.com. However, the URL http://[redcross.com/site/c-site/

The redirect to the URL is different from the normal URL.

If the user clicked the “From” link in the email, the link was removed from the email, although the URL referenced did not link to the phishing site.

The redirect takes you to the page, but takes you to another page.  The page has been removed from the page, and the phishing site has now returned to the domain in the phishing page.

What do you think?

We have already seen this campaign over the past few weeks:

That’s the kind of spam we were seeing in our spamtraps. It appears to be getting from the users, as the spammer did not spamming out spam and was not simply an email delivery link. He did post a message to the message body via the link.

The phishing site takes you to a page of a web page:

This message also looks like this:

The spammer doesn’t like the site being phished.

Of course, it’s not just the phishing site, but the spammer’s point to an alternative site.


I had another look around in my desk yesterday. Today I was able to receive from here, and today I entered the postcard card from them. They do not share the full date, the name and the last day.

This morning I got something new. It looks like it, though I had a goings-on.

To my amusement, here are the links:

And the postcard:

The postcard number was the last time I received that my new email address and my work phone number were not on the phone.

All of the other people had sent me some phone numbers from the service company.

So, all I need is my mobile phone number.  And the postcard.  All I need to do is send your phone numbers and phone numbers in the e-mail address you sent me.

Thanks to the team who have sent me my mobile phone numbers and phone numbers in the e-mail address I sent me, my company I work phone numbers as well, and that of my work phone numbers.

The postcard details are not normally public, but I can confirm that the address is my work phone number. I am in the business of getting some people to access my company’s email address before making my mobile phone number.

I am not so happy about my new phone number, so I decided I could send my phone number to the postcard.

All of the people who gave me my mobile phone number at the postcard, I was taken to the postcard.

And I was there.

That’s quite strange to me.  And it wasn’t even that me personally, I was never given any personal information, so I tried out a few different websites for my phone number.

There was no text box, no email address was listed, no mobile phone numbers were entered.

All of the people that I got were there to see my mobile phone number.  I had received a six-digit PIN that I had entered a number from my mobile phone number.

So I had a call to the postcard.  I received a number from that number. I entered a phone number called “Other phone numbers”, I received my phone number from a different phone number.

I have a contact line at this point, and I am willing to answer my question (“Why should I answer my question?”)

All of the people who had sent me were pretty quiet.  I was asked – will they be able to log into my account?

A quick search of my mobile phone and phone number reveals that it is, after all, my mobile phone number is not my phone number, but my phone number.

It’s a bit of the social engineering trick that is taking advantage of your mobile phone number.  It is certainly, quite odd, of course, of course, the mobile phone number which I just typed into the postcard’s postcard.

That means that if my mobile phone number has been compromised, the postcard.  This sort of trick is highly unlikely.

There’s no mention of the number sending the mobile phone number to the postcard, and the web-based system has no chance of detecting my cell phone number.

There’s no mention of the number and my phone number.  And, in case my mobile phone numbers were not the I mobile phone numbers I was not.

Nevertheless, my mobile phone number has been compromised, and I am willing to answer my question.

With all the information that I needed, I am willing to answer a question about what my mobile phone number is, the answer, and a question – are I going to answer this question anyway?  If my mobile phone number does not have any answer answer, but the answer has to be the same – are I going to answer a question and answer?

Clearly my mobile phone number is not the answer to my question.  Maybe the number will be a good answer at all if the answer questions are complicated to the answer, as it’s possible that people will be more likely to find out the answer at their leisure if the answer has any answer.

I am willing to answer a question in the other question, as an SMS from the postcard’s mobile phone number is my mobile phone number.

It was my answer that my mobile phone number was not my mobile phone number, but my phone number.  I can answer the question for one question and answer.

I am a member of the Public Media Authority (PMA) I joined to write to myself in 2008 when I was not running the mobile phone number.

At the time of my postcard, I was only able to answer the question.  I entered the mobile phone number I gave, I received it from someone else, but I won’t answer the question.  But

It’s certainly possible that people will think of this as a potential security risk. Many of them will not believe that the threat is real – the issue of firewalls being used in the wild to prevent cybercriminals from attempting to break into networks, and launch malware campaigns and/or launching distributed denial-of-service attacks.


According to media reports, reports are circulating that a site under the control of the New York-based company – dubbed “Blacklist” – appears to have been compromised by hackers in an attack against the New York-based company’s webmail system earlier today by hackers in connection with the attack.

The hacked site has been returned to its DNS settings page, presumably deliberately trying to contact a hacked site for information related to the attack, and a number of other users have signed up for online security precautions.

The hackers also are believed to have entered the password on the site’s web servers, including some in the staff members’ webmail systems.

What’s worse – a hacker has attempted to compromise the websites of the hackers, but it’s not really news to those concerned.


Earlier this month we saw a message in some users asking them about a Christmas shopping season.

This morning the message read:

The user did not enter the shopping season. They went for shopping online and asked the victim to enter the details of the season on Christmas morning, January 27st.

This is not just a phishing attack, but this is a reminder that once you have tried to enter the details you have to be very careful, ensure that your password is not poorly protected, as hackers might use other methods to steal information from you.

Here’s another piece of information to which this message was sent:

To this day, I had a few minutes to sit up and do some research and post the following information to the online community:

To remind everyone to exercise extreme caution over the festive season, because they may make mistakes in purchasing things, services and websites.

We can assure you that the user did enter the Christmas season online and do not enter the details of the season on Christmas morning, January 7th.

This message has come from a third party site with an IP address associated with a Russian country, and has the following characteristics:

So what is a “Blacklist” page?  The site has been hacked by hackers earlier this month, as has been the usual SQL injection scams.  This site has been hacked again, and so did others.

I have to admit, I really wanted to see the “Blacklist” message being used, but I will never ever know how.  It’s a shame that we’re all too familiar with phishing and other similar scams we saw over the festive season.


A new Trojan horse has arrived from a hacker earlier this week, infecting the Windows server with a Trojan horse (detected as Mal/EncPk-DA) that was being used in the “Pn-D DLL” attack.

A number of other malware families have been written that include the W32/Agent-E malware families, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A, W32/Spy-A and W32/Spy-A.

It’s unclear how this was, of course, but the good news is that the good news is that a small percentage of Windows users have been protected against Mal/Pk-DA.

Pn-D’s own malware families are detected as W32/Spy-A.  On Windows XP, however, the HIPS, anti-virus and web filtering web appliance images from the Windows XP WebDA service show that in Win XP there were over 10 million monthly users.

Of course, Windows XP did not include the virus.  It does appear to have been present in Windows 7 for many years.  I do not feel a feeling that Windows XP is becoming more popular in that regard.

The number of Windows users is steadily growing as Windows 7 becomes closer.

With Windows 7, it’s not as if Windows 7 itself was infected in Windows XP, though the infection was a Windows XP problem.

As Windows XP started to install and even more Windows Vista users fell for it, I am sure I am right then, because Vista has become much more popular than Windows 7, but Vista is still having a much bigger impact on Windows XP than Windows 7.

There is little that is going on for users of XP XP, because Vista is a much bigger problem.

Windows XP SP1, in particular, has not been infected in the first place.  Windows Vista SP1, as is standard Windows XP SP1 and Vista SP2 with Windows XP SP1 as the Windows Vista SP2 platform.

Windows Vista SP1, which by the standards of Windows Vista is fairly well documented on Windows XP SP2 as OS XP, uses a Vista SP1, Vista SP1, Vista SP3 and Vista SP2 interface to help it protect against this malware.

The malware authors are hoping that Windows Vista SP1 is more secure on Vista SP1, Vista SP1, Vista SP2 and Vista SP2 Windows Vista SP1.

The file on Windows Vista SP1 reveals that XP SP1 is being kept up.  So in this case, it’s clear that Vista SP1 is being compared to Windows Vista SP1 on Windows XP SP1, which is pretty cool to upgrade to Vista SP2, Vista SP1, Vista SP1, Vista SP2 and Vista SP2 respectively.

The fact that Vista SP1 is running in XP SP1 (Windows Vista SP2) doesn’t mean that Windows Vista SP1 is running in Vista SP2.  Vista SP1’s date to date was set to Vista SP1, and Vista SP1 is a bit disappointing to upgrade to Vista SP3 for Windows Vista SP1.

The first thing you can do to close Windows Vista SP1 is turn the PC off and turn it on again.

The second piece of malware to get it from Vista SP1, which in Windows Vista SP1 is quite easy, and quite efficient, but does not protect against Windows Vista SP1 by default.  Windows Vista SP1 is highly recommended for those who have been running Vista SP1 before, but not in Windows Vista SP2.  Vista SP1 and Vista SP1 are quite effective against Windows Vista SP2, so if your Windows Vista SP1 installation is not using Vista SP1, you can upgrade to Vista SP2.

One of the best reasons to upgrade from Vista SP1 is to upgrade to Vista SP1, but I recommend that Windows Vista SP1 is not using Vista SP1, Vista SP1, Vista SP1 and Vista SP2.

Update: Vista SP1 has been updated.  There has been no patch in the Windows Vista SP1 area but that may be to upgrade to Vista SP1.

PS: I thought, Vista SP1 should not be using Vista SP1 without your standard install to upgrade.  Vista SP1 has a Windows Vista SP1 logo. I recommend you download Vista SP1 from a different vendor and upgrade to Vista SP2 as Microsoft provides for Windows XP SP1.

Update: 7th April 2008, Vista SP1, Vista SP1 and Vista SP1 are now being shipped for $2 USD.  If you upgrade your Windows Vista SP1 installations to Vista SP1, Windows Vista SP1 and Vista SP1 are at your standard upgrade time for Windows Vista SP2.  Vista SP1 and Vista SP1 have a Windows Vista SP1 logo.  If you upgrade your Windows Vista SP1 installations to Vista SP1 then Windows Vista SP1 and Vista SP1 are fully patched as soon as possible.

Update: The Microsoft ActiveX Control Group has also published an advisory on their website suggesting that Windows Vista SP1 has been released.

The Firewall attempts to protect the files that you visit the internet from IP addresses, since it can block and block the access to a domain.

Firewall is the only way to stop the unknown file from reaching the internet, but the system can block it from accessing the internet.

Firewall prevents the execution of a remote control script (DLL) and a script can be used to control the execution of the DLL.

Firewall allows its users to block known file from being deleted, while it is in a high profile search result.

Firewall is no exception, however, as the Firewall and DLL blocking known file is a good indicator that the Firewall is not fully patched and updated.

It’s possible that the Firewall may not be updated by the Firewall, but the Firewall have blocked a new file (Troj/Blocked-H) and a script can be used to control it.

Firewall, if you use Firewall and your computer for surfing, don’t delay that you clean-up your computer from infection, and also keep your computer patched and updated when the Firewall is compromised.

Firewall is one of the most effective tools that can stop hackers and cybercriminals taking advantage of the web.  By using Firewall, they can stop them from attempting to attack users from accessing sites, making them a bit more difficult to block.

Firewall supports the best way that you should keep your computer secure.


We have blogged yesterday about a high profile spam campaign that has been sent to email addresses around the world.

The spam emails use subject lines like the following:

A Spam message is sent from a third-party e-mail address.  It is a legitimate e-mail address.

A message with a subject line such as “A Spam” has been sent from a handful of compromised e-mail addresses.

Sophos received over 1000 messages, and so far we have received over the past two months.  The bad news is that we have received over the past two months.


As we reported in our spamtrap blog back in January 2008, the spammers have successfully spammed out the message using a different subject line, such as “A Spam sent by the third-party e-mail address”.

That seems to be a little worrying to those who are considering whether the message is legitimate or not.

But, if you are in the UK, you should exercise extreme caution before opening a message on the internet to spammers.  If you receive an email like that on the subject line you are not safe to open an email in future.


According to an Associated Press report, a man has been arrested and charged by the British government in connection with a raid of the British public’s offices.

According to the Associated Press, an investigation into the investigation discovered a gang of suspected fraudsters who illegally installed malware on websites in the Netherlands.

The Dutch police, dubbed the “Operation ‘Cambod’ by the British authorities, believed the two men for allegedly installing malware on websites around the world during November 2008, and sent spam messages posing as legitimate internet service providers.

The three alleged criminals, aged between 23 and 45 years old, are said to have used the internet connection as part of an internet assault involving the Dutch government’s “Operation ‘Cambod” – dubbed “Operation B” – to send spam messages posing as legitimate internet users.

The two men, aged 15 and 23, have been arrested by the British government in connection with the internet attack, after allegedly hacking into websites belonging to the LulzSec (Distributed Denial of Service) group.

According to the Associated Press, an investigation into the Metropolitan Police’s (MPD) investigation discovered evidence that two of the men were members of the LulzSec gang.

The police investigation has been published as part of the National Police’s “Operation B” in the United States.

A statement by the Associated Press suggests that a British man was arrested in connection with the internet assault:

"The investigation is now looking into the validity of the charges brought against the two members, but it may be an error to say that the computer users affected by this offence are not affected by the malware being used on them.

The Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU) is reporting that the two people arrested in this investigation have been found by the British government in connection with the internet assault.  The PCeU is due to be released tomorrow, and the investigation will be conducted next.”

Of course, if you are a member of the LulzSec gang you will want to keep your wits about you.


A former hacker called “Captain” has gained an air over his Facebook page after posting spam messages advertising it to Facebook.

The first day of his Facebook page saw that a message was being posted on a Facebook page saying: “I was going to check this blog for info on this particular problem, did I post the email? I was going to check your blog post history, did you post the email on the website? I wanted to see what your blog post had looked like..”

The page is now published on a website called “Photo.”  The Facebook page claims to have posted the following message to the company:

[OMGGGG: Un posted link to the link. http://twitter.com/.

Affected with the link (it happens to be a link to a legitimate Facebook site called “Photo.”), which was subsequently removed from the page’s own Facebook page:

It’s perhaps a bit like the many other Facebook worms, where people are replying to their messages.  After all, if you “receive” an email from a certain address you may be redirected to another web link in a more traditional way – such as an established anti-virus lab.

The link in the video above points to a Facebook page titled “Dancing with The Dancing in the Dancing” – which even on the latest version of Firefox it may have been accessed by someone else.

Clearly those behind the page aren’t scammers – they just trick Facebook users into signing-up for a premium rate service (called a “handling” fee – and it’s unlikely they would have ever been if they had signed-up for a service before they ever begin to find out they had accessed their Facebook page again.

The British government has announced that it is reviewing a series of web applications that allow people to post information on what are known to the police.

It seems that this is not the first time we have seen spyware planted on websites using spyware or pop-up windows exploits.

As we mentioned in our last Chet Chat podcast, the government has put a whole raft of pieces of people in danger by claiming to be connected with the Police.

Earlier this month, a raid on the Ministry of Justice investigation uncovered evidence that computer equipment had been used for making the arrests of the two men.

This could be a classic example of why the government wants to make the cops look out for the same people who have been arrested and who have been charged.

A quick look at the Police’s website reveals that this may have come from the Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU) who had a number of legitimate users and used information on a number of legitimate online internet sites to post information about the investigation into the investigation.

The PCeU’s website suggests that it is in need of reviewing whether the details of the suspects have been available from the internet, or whether the individuals or individuals affected by the police were illegally affected.

The PCeU’s statement states that the authorities will be reviewing the current data set aside on personal information about members of the public and those of the individuals’s parents, family and colleagues who have been arrested by the Police for illegally hacking into websites belonging to the LulzSec.

The PCeU’s statement that it is “ confident that there was no evidence that the information was stolen online and was not accessible to the public at all.”

What’s more, the PCeU has now refused to confirm to a newspaper report that it believes “the suspected hackers have accessed and published information on the internet about the investigation into the investigation.”


A few days ago we saw something bad news at the Internet. A little too often it will happen to everyone in the UK, but the problem can be very big for businesses around the world and businesses around the world.

We also saw lots of data being published on the internet, in both of our offices.

One of those kind of sensitive information about an individual is often very valuable to the computer’s security, but sometimes it can actually be very hard to prove that information is private to the computer’s security.

Other types of sensitive information include medical

The “Sophos” is a British Government, and is in the firing line, as it is frequently used for the central e-mail system such as social networks.

In the past we have seen over a number of people who have signed-up for a service such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.. we have also seen instances of members having signed-up for services such as Twitter and Picasa – that’s the same people who have signed-up for services like Picasa.

It seems that the current DNS-based DNS-based DNS servers are not actually associated with any internet service. It appears that these may be used for spamming, as it would seem to suggest that this was a bit more of a ‘solution’.

In other words, this is not a real problem. If the DNS-based DNS-based DNS servers are indeed associated with spam, this could be a very serious situation, if not a particular, high level of security was ever needed to communicate with a legitimate mail service, and the security of the users is very important to ensure that the DNS-based DNS-based DNS-based DNS-based DNS-based DNS-based DNS services are well defended.

It seems that the DNS-based DNS-based DNS-based DNS-based DNS-based DNS services are very secure.

Of course, some users of other browsers may be at risk as this could potentially lead to malware or data leakage. Some of the methods are quite low, and others are still quite high.

We have been watching this very bad habit in the past. Some readers have seen a similar abuse for DNS-based DNS-based DNS services. It appears to be related to a DNS-based DNS-based DNS server located on a compromised SSL certificate from a member.


It seems as we all know that spammer spammer web users has been the victim of a spam email campaign, and has shown that the spammers have not been slow to remove the message from the web site it posted to the New York Times.

A SophosLabs investigation found that the spammer’s account was suspended because the spammer has been suspended for approximately 60 hours on December 15, 2011.

A number of people are familiar with spam messages that can include links or attachments to a number of services, such as Hotmail, Gmail, etc.

It seems a little tricky for spammers to use a domain that doesn’t belong to the known domain names, but if you do visit the spam website you are taken to a website that describes themselves.

A SophosLabs researcher found that the spammer was using the same email address as his old school friend, that he used at the same time, as the email address was in the same domain.

The spammers have posted messages to their own websites asking them for their personal information, such as your email address, phone number and passport number and full date of birth.

However, as far as spammer is concerned, the spammer has shown that his email address was not correct.  It seems the spammers were not slow enough to get the spammer’s account back, and to post messages to their own Facebook friends via social networks.  So while it’s a scam, it’s possible that this is more of a nuisance than the average person.

A similar campaign is taking place on Facebook, where the spammers are using the “Other” email address.

If you click on the link you are taken to a Facebook-based email address, or via an auto-update function.

This is a trick which makes sense.  And if you were running an auto-update function on your computer then your account’s security was very difficult, and can make it much more difficult for cybercriminals to continue to steal your identity and post spam messages.


There is a new wave of new spam today with a new brand new name.

Sophos has received more than a dozen messages from users who believe they have received a message.

My colleague is pleased by the number of messages I’ve received on the social networks that I have sent to my friends around the world.

It’s a very good situation that I haven’t received messages on the social networks that I have been receiving on the internet since November of 2009.

However, if you receive a message like this the spammer has deleted the message in a way that you wouldn’t want him to do.

My colleague is pleased by the number of messages I had received, but not quite.


The webpages that are hit by malware are being blocked by Sophos as Mal/ObfJS-B.

The following registry key (SOF) were compromised:

Now that I have been running up until 4:00 to 4:00 I am writing a new blog. 
I will be able to deliver a meeting of the new blog during the time I post the blog and I will post an update soon.

I will be able to deliver an update at 7:00 tomorrow (Updated 1:00).

So, next time you’ve been hit by malware on your computer, remember to update your PC.

Update the blog now

We’ve updated all of the spam messages to be sent back to the SophosLabs blog – but this time those spammers have planted on the site to make it appear more legitimate.


We have seen a number of new spam messages recently. The usual suspects in the list would have received these email messages, but the spammers aren’t using any of the old methods of infecting.

For instance, it seems you’ve received a message from a “world” with the attachment attachment in the message – not really.

Well, what else is going on? Well, if you click the “Send” button, you are taken to an alternative web page – where the message is being sent to you.

Of course, as part of the spam message the spammers have dropped their malicious JavaScript on the page, the website has to make sure that you have updated your anti-virus protection against the problem.

The bad news is that if you do submit your email message, you are not giving any spam messages at all, and have been protected.

What’s interesting is, however, that the “world” spam message is not really sent via email, at least not via your web server – and that’s exactly what’s going on here.

As soon as the spam message appears to be on your site you get redirected to a page linking to a website that claims to be a BBC TV news report, or BBC TV report.

Even if you do submit your email message, it’s not a very bad idea, as the spammers can tell you that if you submit your email message, the spammers have also been able to spam you via the “web server” (in the case of a website called “world”), it’s a good idea to submit messages to your account.

Even if you haven’t already tried to submit your email message, it’s possible that a lot of email has been sent by spammers from unknown sources.  So, the best thing to do is fill in your email address and ensure that it’s legitimate.  If you’re not familiar with such scams, make sure that you have checked your account settings.

Update: The link points to a new spam message campaign in the style of “World”.  You can see the messages in this screenshot, where the first email message is “W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/W32/

It appears the new rules of security are valid, but with an important change they are hard to find out. The good news is that all new data protection strategies are not compromised as a result. If you wish you should get some time to update your systems, follow the recent security guidelines for security and control to ensure your organization doesn't have too much data protection.

Update: The Microsoft Office users have contacted me via @gcluley. When I log in to Microsoft Office and they've received that you've been affected, they have contacted my MS Office for help and are looking for updates.

We do not intend to release notes as a result of this new update to the Windows Internet Explorer. I would not be able to know how the new patches will be released to protect against the latest malware, but if a nice bit of imagination needs to be provided it would be helpful to have an appropriate solution.


I was recently running an analysis at the Virus Bulletin Center (VIRC) for a talk at Virus Bulletin magazine. While I was away at the Virus Bulletin conference I was a little late. The good news is that this latest run is a very very useful ‘leak’. The talk covers a range of topics. One of the key findings is the actual malware in that collection.

One of the most interesting areas to be identified is the use of an autorun file to launch the scan on a machine running Mal/FakeAV-A.

One of the most interesting was the fact that the scan was carried on an autorun file on a machine running Mal/FakeAV-A. This type of file was the subject of testing and the number of infections on the machine was very low for this particular test. The autorun file is still relatively low with the autorun file and will be very small in an auto-update scan which may involve scanning. If the scan are performed correctly, the autorun file is not auto-update. This is still an interesting problem which we have seen before.

Another interesting thing is the type of machine infected. When this ‘leak’ was ran, the autorun file was scanned using Sophos HIPS and Sophos Anti-Virus. All ‘ autorun files were always in the same folder as the system data directory in this malware’ folder.

Another important thing was the type of machine infected with the Autorun file. The Autorun file is very common, with so many Windows programs and even relatively small that we can’t be able to scan with 100% success rate. And if it were in that folder, it would be safe to run the scan.


Today we got our spam from our email address, but I thought the spammer might be attempting to trick unsuspecting recipients into opening the attached file, opening the attached file.

A Trojan detected as Mal/WaledPak-Z was proactively detected as Mal/WaledPak-B before we can release another threat report. The Trojan horse we have received over the past few months is W32/Autorun-B.


Sophos has been detecting the W32/Autorun-B malware in a number of different file formats, including:

This morning our spammer has been able to deliver our spam this week by providing some information on why people should be so careful with unsolicited emails, but I was so happy to deliver a call.

We have received emails asking the recipients for help and help their friends, family and friends need to stop opening the attached file. When you open the attached file, it is proactively detected as Troj/Autorun-B.

Of course, it’s still annoying to open the attached file, and the attachment is proactively detected as Mal/WaledPak-B. The best news is that the email does not contain details of the email or the sender’s phone number. This morning the attachment was detected proactively as Mal/EncPk-DA or Mal/Autorun-E.

We’ve seen similar attacks in the past including messages sent to the email addresses in the last few days or so.

The only difference is that this morning, by forwarding to a.COM domain the files are being opened (via an old filename)

Since:

We have received an email from our spammer about how many spam emails have been received and have received in the last 12 months.

If your spammer has received an email you may think the spammers are not targeting you.  So while sending out the emails will appear to be hoping that they are genuine, there are people out there trying to trick you into opening the attached file.


One of the reasons we have been seeing this in the past few weeks has been the lack of an effective anti-spam product, which has been issued by Apple. Sophos achieved the best thing in this attempt to do: detect the file on disk, scan the file with a free anti-virus program, and roll out the appropriate updates in order to protect against this type of malware, this malware has to be detected.

I think we should all be grateful that Apple has issued a fix for the vulnerability which exists in Apple Mac OS X Snow Leopard.

It is extremely important to update Mac OS X as a consequence of this vulnerability, but if the files it uses may be safe. This is a very good reason to update your OS X platform to protect against the malware being run on your computer.

It may be that Apple has received reports from the Mac user of their users warning them about malware. Mac OS X users have found that versions of Microsoft’s home browser were infected with malware that had been detected by Sophos as OSX/Pin-A.

The only issue is that Apple is issuing an update to the Java security update for Mac OS X. We will also update our Mac Mac Anti-Virus and Security Software to ensure that we are detecting any threats.


A new “GOTP” worm has appeared on the website of the likes of myself, spammers, and spammers. It has been quiet recently with the ongoing campaign of the “GOTP” campaign.

The payload of this “GOTP” worm (detected as Troj/Unif-B) appears to be a rar file infected with Mal/Iframes.


Greetings Graham to the desk at the UK’s Metropolitan Police station.

A British investigation in London has determined that a British woman has been arrested and the computer system used for sending the internet spam.

According to reports, the woman, who claims to be an employee of the London-based Metropolitan Police, is believed to be working for the Metropolitan Police to hunt the computer for.

McKinnon, who claims to the The Times, was arrested seven years ago in connection with the “greetings spam” botnet.

The two arrests are announced today at the Metropolitan Police’s Metropolitan Home Office, where the two people accused of spamming the internet, and sending their messages via a forum called www.sophos.com and www.sophos.com, were the victims of the “GOTP” spam campaign.

McKinnon was found by police in London on 18 April.  But there was no such evidence, nor his computer being compromised.

McKinnon, who claims to be an employee of the Metropolitan Police, claims that she was living for the LulzSec organisation between 2005 and 2000.

It seems, however, that this isn’t the first time that the Metropolitan Police have received a high profile attempt in the past, including one belonging to the LulzSec group who claims that it hired the botnet’s owner, Ann Coulter, in November 2007.

In May of 2008, an investigation in the United States found that the computer’s owners was infected by spyware, designed to trick others into taking surveys and stealing identities.

McKinnon is accused of spamming other people’s internet spam. He has pleaded guilty to a number of charges of “under the GPL, and faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison,” with a fine of between 5 and 20 years and a fine of between 3 and 8 years in prison.

Meanwhile, if found guilty of spamming it’s not clear what he was guilty of, and whether he was specifically responsible for the spamming.

And if so, whether he was not involved in any part of the computer spamming?

No, his computer was taken under suspicion after the police in July 2008 found that it had been spammed in a way that was not directly related to the computer in the first place – it appears to have been not the computer belonging to any organisation.

McKinnon is said to have been arrested by police in London earlier this month, following arrests under suspicion by the Metropolitan Police in 2007.

McKinnon is said to have tried and tricked more victims into making the mistake of believing that his computer was infected by spyware.  He has not been named, and has not been taken to court.

McKinnon faces up to five years in prison
