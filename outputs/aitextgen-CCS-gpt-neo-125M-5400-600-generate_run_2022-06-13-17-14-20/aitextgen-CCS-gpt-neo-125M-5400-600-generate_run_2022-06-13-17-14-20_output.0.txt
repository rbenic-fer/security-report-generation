and the FBI.

According to media reports, the Dutch government has published details of the computer hackers’ data relating to the two security holes.

A statement published on the Dutch website, published yesterday, said that the Dutch police were investigating the arrests.

In addition, the Dutch National Police Service’s press release said that the suspects will be interviewed for further investigation.

According to the Dutch government’s website, the two security experts will be on hold.


When we look at the personal email address of the users in question, it’s usually the same email address to a Yahoo email address.

We have seen examples of spammers attempting to trick Yahoo users into opening their inboxes.

In fact, in the last 12 months, the spammer has made it as hard as possible to spread the messages around their inboxes.

We’ve seen spammers and malware authors in the past since the internet-enabled spammer has been on his/her/her/scam messages to use in his/her life.

Here’s one of the subject lines of the email messages we intercepted last week:

Hello < Email address>

We were currently working on a customer who sent us a scan letter for this email address, but I wish you were to continue to send us a scan letter.

We have received several messages and will update your Yahoo address soon

We'll continue to improve the security of your Yahoo email address

We've got so far this email address has been spammed out, so we will have some more details tomorrow.


In 2007, I noticed something strange in a spam email email address. The email address was in fact quite the same IP address that the spammer uses. So what’s happening here?

That’s so busy that I was interested to find out more about the subject lines of the spam emails:

The spam message is, of course, subject lines of the email. I suspect that the spammers could have broken their reputation in this. But don’t believe me!

We thought that the spammer’s email address may have been compromised in his/her/scam messages, or that the spammers were using the same password for multiple services. So what’s the purpose?

Here’s the spam message that I received today, and it looks like it’s a genuine message. It looked like this:

I’ve been receiving emails from these spammers in the past. For instance, the messages that direct me to an IP address belonging to the group known as “Anonymous”. Of course, in 2008, the messages were not really from the group known as “Anonymous” or indeed “Anonymous”.

These messages come from spammer me. The email address is not correct, and I suspect that the spammers’ inbox address should not be used to spam me.

It’s possible that if spammers want the sender to use the mail address to spread their messages around their inboxes, they could also make it too easy for them to access their email addresses or even send emails to other spammers.


It was just a strange surprise that I’ve been meaning to visit the web site of one of the web servers of a web browser.

A few days ago I noticed the following email (we detected the email as Mal/ObfJS-B):

So what happens if you visit this web site then it pretends to be the same one we saw yesterday:

The body of the email looks like this:

The message body has a single text message with a different filename.

As usual we’ve seen a lot of webpages having been compromised (in our case, this email does not contain the word “computing”).

This reveals that the spammer has changed the IP address of the web server.

What he did was guess how many requests were sent (hundreds of them!).

I thought he might find that the web server is sending over one hundred,000 requests (hundreds of which could be in excess of five per day), while he found he should have received more than 10,000 requests each.

That’s a very similar problem for webmasters.

So what’s wrong with the page?  Well, I have been meaning to visit this web page for a while now, so what happens if I visit this web page then it presents a message saying “Your site has been blocked because your address has been compromised by your spammer”.

If I visit that web page in the email, you’re seeing the message “Your site has been blocked because of your spammer”.  Of course, this will raise the ire of the internet community.  Hopefully I won’t be so lazy and click on the link to find out more.


We’ve got something to lose of some people.

Here’s an example of a website that has been hit – hit with a script, that has a random URL pointing to an IP address.

The domain is hosted in Russia, which makes it very possible to get to the website and find out what was going on.

That way, the “%” address should be a useful reminder that people out there have been struck, and that cybercriminals aren’t just targeting Russian website owners.  They also – the “%” address should be a useful reminder to those who use the word “.”


Over the past few weeks we have been seeing messages claiming to come from a Facebook application called “Anonymous”.

The email appears to have been sent from a Russian Russian-speaking Russian-speaking Russian, but with the intention of spamming out messages.

The body of the message itself contains a link that describes what “Anonymous” are you typing into the message, rather than its own site address, making the message look very similar to one of the many fake anti-virus fake websites.

Clicking on the link you are taken to the first webpage in the message, which has a message box and an image of “Anonymous”.

The second page, the text box, claims to be hosted in Russia. The second page, in turn, claims that “Anonymous” are behind the “Anonymous” botnet.

If you run the fake anti-virus website then you might notice that you are using the “Anonymous” name on the first page, although the second page refers to “Anonymous” in Russian.

The result?  You have a version of “Anonymous” that you would have a page under the “Anonymous” botnet.

This would be more unusual for a fake anti-virus company than in one of the fake anti-virus business-viruses.  But it does raise the ire of the people who would have been struck in this spam campaign.


I was going to visit one of the blogs that I have been watching recently. The day was over, but it was busy.

No need to click here.

We saw the usual thing on the first page of interest. The first website had been hit, a similar file was opened to the next website. A quick search of the file in the web page reveals that the second page was compromised with Mal/ObfJS-B.

The third page of interest was another little bit. The file referenced in the spam message contained the link to an IP IP address belonging to a Russia-based ISP.

It wasn’t an IP address.

One of the many interesting things was a URL containing malicious content (via web link). But the web page pointed to by the user’s IP address reveals that it was a download and a “download” as well.

The IP address of the two domains was registered to Russia, and the web page contained a URL linking to the Russian-based ISP’s website.

It appears the IP address of the two domains was hosted on Russia, with all of their hosted online site registered to Russia.

Somehow, however, the webpages from Russia (that was taken down again), were proactively compromised.  Some of these domains were proactively compromised.

It would be a shame, indeed, that so many people were clicking on the link.  However, there is still a small amount of effort that is taken to detect and disinfect the malicious webpages.

It’s no surprise that some people are being tempted to download and install fake anti-virus software via the Russian language to install their fake anti-virus product.  But now I doubt the Russian people are in their opinion that it was possible to install their fake anti-virus product from the Russian ones.

The other day’s day was over, as the website hosting malware was hit again.

I was in the second part of the world at thought, the world at sheze the problem of how many “Linux” are being hit by malware. However, it has taken many to make the point of seeing the rest of the world hit (that was the day we visited the webpages at Sophos from the Ukraine) and how
====================
had sent a message to the user’s security team saying “We have received a number of emails saying we have received the full date of birth. The email says that we have received emails on the subject of an official error message. All of the emails have the subject line and body attached and we are on the subject line to keep our customers informed and secure. Please do not reply to the email or respond to the email.

We are working to restore the issue back to the genuine information and to improve our current settings to provide other customers with the full date of birth. This email has the subject line and body attached. It will be taken to your own mailboxes and your users are now protecting your data.

Please, please do not reply to the email or reply to the telephone in the office. If you received the email you should delete the spam messages from their websites and forward them to your admins.

If you use Internet Explorer then they should update your browser to the latest version. We have been the victim of the spamming malware and will keep them up for the last update.

We have been the victim of the spamming malware for some time, but the spammers are busy hoping that their old-fashioned email messages will remain out there, claiming to come from the spammers. Unfortunately, the messages have not been delivered in an attachment and this attack might not be the first.


In my personal experience, it looks like it’s a legitimate website belonging to the US Army. It’s a website serving some malware and I personally would like to thank the security staff for taking the appropriate steps to better protect my web server.

I don’t know what the website has happened so I will not be the first. It seems like an official website, in fact I don’t know what the site’s source was, but what the site has seen so far it seems like an official, legitimate website that the people contacting were in response to some of the malware-infected websites.


This week’s security round is here, with a couple of new things to say.

First, in fact, the site has been updated to point to some of the site’s new ‘laptop’ webpages, some of which appear to have been hacked by a hacking group.

Secondly, the site has a DNS record of the DNS records that the hackers used to control the hacked sites.

of the World of Warcraft, as well as the TV show.  In a statement issued to BBC News, BBC Radio Five reporter Christopher Seer reported the story of hackers in the country.

I think if you remember how hackers stole £200,000 from British customers via the London internet, this hack would be a wise reminder that we all have plenty of money to be stolen from innocent people as they are, not just from the people of the world, who have been in the headlines for over a year.

The bad news in this blog post is that a password stealer has been found by hackers who have planted malware on their website disguised as a news report.

A file called “news report.exe” hosted malware inside the hacked website on a compromised server located in Shetland, Virginia.  The file was subsequently identified as “the source of the attack.”

Some of the details of the infection were:

The Trojan was detected as Troj/InfJS-A by the following URL:

The infection began as a matter of three minutes, where we detected another file, dubbed “news report.exe”.

We identified the file that was subsequently acquired, but found nothing to it.

No evidence to support the file is provided, but it does appear to have contained the file and thus no-one else could find any way to identify it.

The news report claims that the attack occurred in early October, but the hack of a computer connected to the web site was closed soon.  If you are an affected user it would be wise to scan your computer and clean-up your computer.

In the past few days, we have seen various groups and websites involved in this attack have published information about the hack and it’s becoming apparent that their website was recently hacked.

And hopefully the hackers will do more to stamp out more and more evidence of the hack – and will clean up every webpage that is infected with the malware.  It is time for some of the many people concerned to take prompt action to ensure that their computer security is up-to-date.


W32/Vidaj-E

That’s the name of the file, it seems.


Spammers are warning the world about their money-making scams.

According to an online poll conducted by the online firm, 7% of the overall fraudsters are from people who may be connected to the world of cybercrime.

A number like this makes us believe that cybercriminals have hit innocent users with bogus security alerts, or on their computers in return for a financial reward of at least $300.

So, as the hackers have informed their victims that they have been in the headlines for their money-making schemes, they have been right there.

And what’s a shame that we can’t be sure.  Just because a convicted cybercriminal has allegedly planted malicious code on websites has gone too far.


Facebook users may not be familiar with scams that spread quickly via Facebook users’ walls, but this month we saw a very similar attack spreading via Facebook: Facebook users reported seeing a scam.

This time the messages read like this:

You may not know why this Facebook scam appears on Facebook, but this scammer has planted some JavaScript on pages on your Facebook page that then redirects users to a web-based site hosted in Russia.

The script on the page takes you to a site hosted in Russia:

That’s a lot of spam, of course, as Facebook’s privacy settings are so poor.

In one of the last few months, Facebook have made much of its users’ inboxes, so we’re not going to repeat this one soon.

Update: It appears that we now have a fully-patched version of this scammer:

* If you wish to know more about the scammer’s Facebook page, remember to remember to delete the offending page from the start.

Of course, Sophos has received a number of spam messages in recent weeks, with most of which are from a small number. These include links to malware, spam messages and a variety of other security threats.

So what’s happening now?  The email message claims that the hackers have posted a post on the official forum that has posted to pastebin. This isn’t really a response to the hackers having posted the message – I thought that someone else was posting this message to a whole variety of people.

However, it looks like the hackers are not really trying to spread malware on their behalf.  When I searched for more details of what was happening, I was redirected to a URL ending in http://www.scr.uk.

The hackers behind the messages seem to be using some effort, and hopefully some of them will have posted a malicious update.


SophosLabs is seeing something strange at the moment.

A new variant of SophosLabs has been published by SophosLabs in a podcast, in both cases.

This morning, SophosLabs received a number of new samples each week.

So, if you are curious, please bear in mind that our analysts are proactively detecting the viruses proactively as Mal/EncPk-LE (also known as Mal/Dorf-A).

Update: The topic was updated today to include the title “Sophos Anti-Virus for Windows”.


Spammers, who often claim to have compromised various websites, are hoping that they will be able to steal millions of dollars in the future.


Over the last few days we have been tracking the amount of money that has been spammed out in the past three months and today we received a sample we are trying to contact customers.

The spammers want to get you to invest in this type of survey, and to make money, they use affiliate affiliate-based sales.  In this case, the the purpose is to trick you into purchasing a “card” or “card only” in order to earn their cash.

It seems that some people are waiting to get their card stolen, but it is perhaps the case that they are going to be able to steal it.

Even if you are not, you will find that the site has recently blocked that as we do not know the link, or that the spammers have chosen not to visit the page at all.

It’s important to keep in mind that if you have “solution” of the spam messages, there is nothing really going to do with them.  The spammers are trying to trick you into taking a survey and you are left exposed by the scams.

Of course, if you fall for the scams you might be wise to keep your computer security up-to-date.


During Friday, March 2 2008, I was hoping that an email came to me from a Facebook friend. A member of his Facebook friend was a member of yours – so the message was sent to me via a message from Facebook.

It may be a little more quiet indeed, as the spam messages include a link to a legitimate web certificate with an attachment called  www.iitis.com.

This would obviously seem a fairly quiet surprise to some people.  However, if you are a spammer, remember to make sure you have not been a victim of malware attacks.


A gang claiming to be a money-making company has tried to sue Facebook for a series of claims and charges has been tried against over the weekend in which it alleged the two people who have been using online banking and information security services have been the victim of hackers.

The hackers, named as “Pump”, claim that their scheme was not a proper-service-service scheme, but was just part of a large and somewhat controversial internet group known as the “Anonymous”.

The people who may have been used in the phishing attacks, meanwhile, including the hackers in the past were also known to be the criminals, who have claimed that their identity was not compromised in the past.

There was speculation on the Facebook website that that the hackers are members of the “Anonymous” group, who could be connected with the scheme.

It may not be a surprise to see the media and Facebook have been hit again, as they have previously denied that the hack was specifically targeted by hackers.

The scammers aren’t interested in making money by making money from people they aren’t friends with, but they still need users to be careful about what they do not trust.

And once again, it was a good thought to make sure that Facebook’s security team is working to stamp out the scams and clean-up the problem down.

And what’s more, the scammers do not just steal usernames and passwords for online banking and information security services.  They use those names and addresses in their own messages and other online banking, not the usernames and passwords that were used to phish usernames and passwords for other online banking and information security services.

There is also the problem of phishing scams.  Phishing scams, where the fraudster claims that you have stolen usernames and passwords of your users, make sure that the scammers are not using phishing tactics.

It would be wise to make your own point of view when this happens.

The good news is that Facebook did not take the step too far, making it easy for the scammers to steal usernames and passwords from accounts that they believe have been compromised.

Updated May 8, 2011: Facebook updated its privacy settings to say that it “encourage” users to enter their details online, and that it will be making information about you online and your friends and family online shopping.

Users should remember that privacy online shopping isn’t only a problem, of course.  Many of the online consumer data stolen by the hackers was not stolen, and it was easy to see that Facebook would be keen to take additional steps to better protect its users’ privacy.

Facebook has announced that a third-party application may be able to post messages about its users on the Facebook site that it believes you are “friends” or friends of.

The bad news is that the rogue application – which claims to be a “Facebook” – claims to be a “sharing software app”, but claims that it can post messages and email to users’ Facebook pages.

It’s worth considering whether Facebook has informed people of the problem by warning them about the problem by warning them about the problem.

There are two reasons for warning about privacy.  The first is that it’s an old trick that Facebook uses to post messages to Facebook via its website, and have provided the link to rogue applications to the various online users.

The other is that Facebook claims it’s “encourage” that Facebook will remove access to its website – and that it can then post messages to the Facebook page that it believes they have been sending messages to.

Another trick is that it’s not possible that Facebook may have used the “encourage” button for any number of reasons, and has agreed to remove access to the Facebook page from the list of “friends” or friends of its users.

The bad news is that Facebook doesn’t appear to be sharing with users’ Facebook pages any more – and that’s all very well.  Facebook appears to be more likely to block access to a page that they believe Facebook wants to “find” their information from being posted by others, rather than to encourage users to post messages to Facebook.

====================
s, hackers have created their own botnets that share spam messages.

A new botnet will be infected as soon as a computer can reach its peak, and the hackers will attempt to steal information about your company and your company that you’ve been able to log on for some time.  It’s only possible to be infected on the machine, but even if it has a copy of itself, this could be a significant security risk for your company.

It’s certainly an interesting turn for some anti-spam and anti-virus companies, but let’s face it, if you’ve ever encountered a malware attack like this, you’ll know that you should be careful about the computer security of its users.


Earlier this week we published another security report about a software zero-day vulnerability in Java which Sophos products were seeing every day.

We are seeing reports of this and other vulnerabilities being found in other versions of Java.

There are several major vulnerabilities currently at the risk, with the largest remote hacker being a sysadmin in your country, and the second being “Bad Antivirus”.

Two of the vulnerabilities at the time, both in the Java version of Java, are remote code execution vulnerabilities (RCEs) in Java 2.0 versions, though Java 2.0 versions are vulnerable, and both vulnerabilities could allow malicious code to run and run on the client.

Two of them, CVE-2009-32 and CVE-2009-29, lead you to believe that in one of these attacks you would be able to gain remote control of a Java Java server connected to your web servers – this is one of many ways of exposing your Java computers (even if the Java server is located in the UK).

Fortunately, a reliable web certificate for a Java server is available.

In other words, the Java version of Java is quite legitimate, and we won’t be seeing a critical one soon.  We will release a patch for the next update in time.


We saw a rise in spam yesterday for various of our home users today.  We saw a lot of spam recently in terms of the recipient’s password being used and the messages were all over the wall.

In addition to that, this is all very similar to the usual theme in an email.  It was all a bit of a “legitimate spam”.

So don’t just read the latest SophosLabs threat report, but also read the latest security fixes.


Hot on the heels of a widespread phishing attack, hackers have compromised the servers of online “tok” sites at the the Internet company’s annual event.

Here’s a video I made, demonstrating the attack in a podcast:

Yesterday, on a high number of people’s Twitter accounts were compromised by hackers, tricking unsuspecting users into clicking on bogus links from popular Twitter accounts.

The hack was dubbed the “Operation B” in the video above.  The hackers posted messages to their Twitter friends asking them if they had received their banking details:

====================
(detected by Sophos as Mal/Spy-B) for further investigation.


The number of spamming has dropped by, as many of the world’s biggest computer users seem to have fallen for the latest campaigns in the last few weeks.

And there’s a new spamming campaign – this time pretending to be a link in a email sent to all of your online friends.  We’ve also seen an interesting ecard spam campaign last week – another attempt by a group of hackers to spread their messages.

The messages were all very similar, the message appears to be:

The address has been temporarily changed, and an ecard spam email arrived from the same address (presumably as the address was changed).


A quick search by the loosely-knit “Wired” reveals a strange piece of malware – detected as Troj/Spy-B.

Sophos has received a number of spam emails which claim to come from the “Spy”.

Some of the email messages claim to come from an email address in the United States.  But, according to the company of a Russian-American company, the email is from an unknown address.

Other details for the email messages can be found in a number of spam messages, or from a company based in Russia.


The “Wired” published a statement on behalf of the US Army.

According to the statement, the US Department of Defense and National Defense have informed a number of US customers regarding a security breach in which information relating to the US Defense Research Center has been exposed.

We have published a statement that the hackers have gained access to classified information relating to US Defense Secretary William Lynn’s Cybernetic Group.

Our analysts believe that the sensitive information is being held in Russia – but we are not going to provide details of the hack to those interested in the US and the United Kingdom.

What has been revealed at this point is that the US military is still out of action at the country’s top defense contractor and that it was not known at the time the hack was posted.

A statement by the US Defense Secretary shows that it will be releasing a statement to all of the US staff at the US Defense Ministry and National Defense, as well as a statement which reads:

"To protect our US customers, we believe that the information stored in the database was being used in the US and other countries to compromise our defense and protect our national security. We will also be releasing additional information as appropriate to protect our national security."


The first day of an investigation to investigate the hack in January 2008 (when the US Army and US Air Force were at the House of Lords of Illinois), is when the end of December 2008.

It’s a sad thought for some of the US Defense Ministry, and it’s not been an official announcement on that their US defense team has informed them of the problem – but it does encourage others to take more extreme action in this regard for their own.

Yesterday in California, a former US military official, who claims to be the US military, sent an email to staff who suggested that it would be a surprise to see if someone else had compromised the US government.

That said, the hackers appear to have used some old-fashioned email to trick staff into taking the threat seriously and writing malicious code.  But that hasn’t stopped the hackers from using other disguises.  The hackers are now using the email as an lure for more and more people – as it’s easy to understand that even if they are really concerned about the security of their own computers, the hackers could have targeted a number of organisations.

According to the US Defense Secretary, the US Department of Defense and National Defense  have held a common message regarding an attempt by the US and U.S. “Spy” hackers to spread spam, spread malware and plant malicious payloads.

SophosLabs has received emails from a number of the organizations we support.  As part of the ongoing fight against cyber-security in the United States, the US and U.S. members can read their own articles from the staff department’s Office of the Director and Chairman of National defense in an email to their friends or partners.


The day that the April 2009 malware was seen had been seen for approximately three minutes (remember the day where they come from?

A typical day:

One of the biggest attacks we are seeing in recent weeks has been:

Today, the day that we are seeing in Mal/Packer, Troj/Packer-A has a message as to its “Wanna”:

"This malware was not delivered as a normal program at all.

The message body contained a typical message body of a legitimate version of Mal/Packer-A in which the Trojan (also known as Zeus) was proactively detected as Troj/Spy-A.

The message body contained a link to the malware detected as Mal/Packer-A in the message body.

In the following case, the malware was detected as Mal/Packer-E.

The first day we have seen this type of attack was Christmas morning in the form of W32/Spy-A:

That’s a shame the social engineering tricks used by the criminals are not the latest, but clearly the fact that the day was busy with malware in the first place is another reminder to not just be on your guard, and to keep the security up-to-date.


The W32/Autorun Trojan, detected by Sophos as Mal/Autorun-A (also known as Storm, we’ve detected W32/Autorun-A before) continues to be installed, and we will continue to monitor its activity with a regular update.  However, it is possible that some files could have been compromised by this.

We are currently detecting W32/Autorun-A since its release.


Today SophosLabs analysts encountered a malicious script from the W32/Autorun.inf file containing a malicious shellcode.

Mal/Autorun-A also contains a ZIP file.

This file is proactively detected as Mal/Autorun-A for the first time we have been seeing infected files from Zbot, such as Troj/Packer-A.

In a nutshell, the file is dropped to a removable drives using the Zbot encryption process (Zbot).


We are detecting the malicious W32/Autorun-A code in the above graphic, with W32/Autorun-A being proactively detected as Mal/Autorun-A on the drives.

The Zbot detection is performed by W32/Autorun-A by compressing the file with the file compression as the Zbot files are accessed.

We then detect the file Zbot.

As you can see in the image we’ve also seen, W32/Autorun-A does not get executed as you might expect.  So, if you are running the “Unknown” version of the Zbot that will be proactively detected as Mal/Zbot-A then you would expect to get infected.

So, in order to get infected and not have you there, you need to manually examine the Zbot and scan it with the Zbot program.

It’s quite a bit of fun to see malware such as this so that we don’t have a copy of the malware.  But it certainly does have a Trojan of its own – Troj/Zbot-A can’t be run at all, and its payload is “Packer”.

There’s a lesson here, though, though, that no-one wants to be snapper enough to get infected.


For the last couple of days we’ve seen fake AV malware in our spamtraps, in fact it was announced today at the end of August 2009.

The fake AV malware starts off by using a random string, which in turn drops a random string (in this case, a random string) into its own download package.

In reality it’s very similar, of course, to the fake AV malware, which has a number of different languages – so in this case, it’s very similar.

It’s certainly a scammer – this particular version was created after initial download with an additional random string (in this case, the string was another string as it happened to be a random string for the executable to contain) but, of course, you can probably understand why they give a random string in the source and what it’s up to.

It’s easy to see why cybercriminals haven’t changed their tactics – it’s not just the fake AV malware we’re seeing very widely.

In the last few hours we have been seeing an increasing number of web attacks, with growing numbers of redirecting to new domains.  Today, I am pleased to find that in most of the webpages we are seeing at the same time, in the last couple of days, some of those domains are being hosted on legitimate
====================
.  And I’m sure they’ll find out, if there’s the problem.


With the recent release of two-factor authentication, it is not simply that we need to provide our users with the same user-data to secure that our data is protected from threats.

The recent wave of new malware with little the time as we are on the ground were in fact making it easy for some of the world’s most notorious internet users to access their websites.

One of the main reasons why we should care about your security is the fact that your organization may find it incredibly easy to log into and access your sites on the same servers, making it easy for hackers to log into your account in the same way.  After all, if they are in the habit of allowing hackers to steal your identity, they’ll want to do the same.

One of the reasons why we should be concerned about our critical information is if the victim has not actually logged in to their website that their credentials may have been compromised.


There’s a lot of ‘zombie’ online ‘jacking’ to be found by the SophosLabs team.

As we described at the time of the release, there is much effort being put in place to protect the quality of webpages that you visit. The last few are the ones we were able to access to, but some of them – such as a web page – have recently been hacked.

It’s not just the number of ‘zombie’ or ‘cyber’, which we will see as the number of people who are infected has also hit by criminals.  These attacks are being spread via peer-to-peer networks.  And we have in some way been using peer-to-peer connections since last week.

As mentioned in a blog post yesterday, it is possible that hackers have gained entry to the list of known malicious webpages hosting the attacks.  By identifying those sites and responding to the security threats that have hit our users, they can potentially be able to steal usernames, passwords, and more.


Earlier this week we saw a new variant of the Zbot malware which was proactively detected as Troj/Zbot-A by Sophos’s products as Troj/Zbot-A.

The malware was proactively detected as Troj/Zbot-A on 11 April 2008, by SophosLabs as Troj/Zbot-A.

The Trojanized component of the Zbot was proactively detected as Troj/Zbot-A on 11 April 2008.

This is the first ever variant which has been proactively detected as Troj/Zbot-A.  The Troj/Zbot-A Trojan also had Troj/Zbot-A as well – as many other security-related variants of the Zbot family has been proactively detected in the past.


One of the most interesting of the two security related security related files that we have in our spam traps is the file of the W32/Spy-A virus.

By now, that’s one of the reasons to get infected.

The first time we see a file has been infected is when we take the files from a compromised computer on the same computer as it, so that we do not want that to get infected by malware. So, we would expect that the Dorf malware generated through W32/Spy-A and the Dorf malware generated by the Dorf malware will no longer be using W32/Spy-A on this file.

The second, W32/Spy-A – detected as W32/Spy-A on 11 April 2008 by Sophos as Mal/Spy-A.

In this case, the file W32/Spy-A was also detected as W32/Spy-A, and then used as a file to infect the new version of Zbot (also known as Zeus) in order to spread the Dorf malware.  For that reason, Zbot uses a variety of different files to send the Dorf messages:


SophosLabs has identified the Zbot family in W32/Spy-A.

The Zbot family has been detected by Sophos as W32/Spy-A for the following reasons:


The Zbot family is W32/Zbot-A by SophosLabs.

We detected W32/Spy-A at the end of 2008 using W32/Spy-A.

We saw W32/Spy-A at the time of writing, and we are still detecting it.

As shown by the above graphic, W32/Spy-A is not new. In fact, it is not new, but we have been detecting it as W32/Spy-E since September 15th.

For the second time in less than a month, W32/Spy-A received some media reports from our support team about Troj/Spy-A.

In the past few weeks, Troj/Spy-A has been spammed out using the W32/Spy-E method, making the Zbot family very difficult to detect and run in the wild.


One of the interesting results is that SophosLabs received over 4.5 million emails each day of the year, which are sent to people who use their Windows Live CD/Linux account.

A few hours ago we received another wave of spam emails, which may even have come from the same email address (as seen in previous campaigns).  But that’s not exactly the kind of email.

It could be that some people used the old trick of trying to get infected on computers, and have malware installed on their computer.  Even more strange, of course, is the fact that we are still seeing an increase in email.

Take the spammer’s trick of making a large amount of money out of the effort they put in to get their infected computer.  It also appears to be a rather minor move that can have serious consequences.


We’ve seen a large number of new malware every day.

We’ve just published a new report today, examining the top 10 spam threats in SophosLabs.

As well as reviewing the top ten spam-relaying countries around the world, our aim is to improve the quality of proactive protection of our customers’ computers by reducing the number of emails sent.

This is just the latest spamming in a very limited way. SophosLabs has also published detailed instructions on how to make a unique email message and a method to manage email filtering.


Over the last few days there’s been an explosion of new malware samples every day.

This morning, at the AusCERT conference in London, I’m celebrating a Christmas present for our US customers, SophosLabs.

Our US customers are getting on the same with the second year, SophosLabs. We’ve published a detailed summary about the Dorf malware today, and I will be off the air again on January 31st.

That’s quite a bit of catching, but I’ll keep you posted next.

We’ll be off the air again on March 25th, 2008, and hopefully there’s time for some to fly back to the UK office before Christmas morning (Monday).  I’m sure you’ll be back soon – so please let us know.

Oh, and if you’re not currently running SophosLabs – don’t forget to install our brand new and intelligent threat report tool (and if you’re in your office), we have a guide.


It’s Friday morning, and if you’ve been reading this, you’ll probably agree to the usual suspects – so why not grab yourself a coffee with your school’s help and take a cold lunch to the UK government’s Metropolitan Education and Development Authority?

A quick search on your home page reveals that an assortment of randomly-chosen computer-related news is currently burning.

This isn’t what you want to read on TV.  For instance, I am the “GCHQ” who has been responsible for the attack in the United States, is accused of being a “solution of the LulzSec”.

So, I’m going to be off at the University of Reading, and so I’ll be off the air again.  If you do get an email I will visit the British government’s website and ask you to scan your computer for suspicious activity (the answer to a number of different websites is to visit the website for the purpose of the alleged “solution”), but I don’t know what this means.


A few days ago we saw another Facebook scam scam being spammed out using the image of a man-in-the-middle site.

This weekend the scammer has posted an update – clearly his name was too familiar.

As ever, keep your computer security up-to-date, and be sure that you keep your computer patched.  Many of the people I have been able to access from the moment of writing are getting
====================
” as a video player that was captured by someone who allegedly posted offensive messages.

The images captured on the internet, and posted by the hackers, show the victim having shared a message via email that had posted images to Facebook, and had posted links to viral Facebook worms.

In some circumstances, a message on the website’s own Facebook page appears more offensive than the original message.  The post made the message appear genuine, but Facebook was clearly not slow to remove the link.

In other instances, the posts also allegedly posted an offensive message on the social networking site, but a message on the website’s own Facebook page posted an invisible message to the Facebook account owner’s own Facebook account.

That’s the real message that people are likely to find more offensive messages and malicious links on Facebook.  Maybe Facebook is busy making the message appear genuine.

Meanwhile, on the social networks’ site, the messages posted on the social networking site claimed that it had been published on the same “computing” site.  However, there were no messages posted to the profiles belonging to people that Facebook claimed to contain pornography.

So, if you click on a link that appears on the Facebook link, it will be detected as Troj/FakeAV-N or Mal/FakeAV-E.

Sophos detects the fake messages as spam, and is continuing to monitor their activity.

We will be seeing more Facebook users taking advantage of this situation as it brings us a better-known case of cybercriminals taking advantage of the situation to compromise innocent users’ Facebook accounts by targeting users’ walls.

Update: Sophos has released a threat report that states that hackers are using social networks and other social networks to spread spam, spread malware and spread spam via Facebook.

====================
data is stolen.

Sophos customers are protected from such threats as Mal/BredoZp-E.

The issue is, of course, that when we are talking of data protection and protection.  If that data protection is a policy in the document on the user site, how do we actually protect it?

I would make it clear that the data protection and protection of data protection systems are both relatively small and relevant to our operations.  But I am pleased that our data protection systems can do more than this.  The fact is, we are able to deliver data protection to a degree, and to defend against the very problem of data protection.

The problem with data protection is, as in the previous case, that a user cannot access an additional layer of protection.

So, let’s not forget that this is just one of several steps we can take to improve our information protection.  I would like to know more about what this list does.

Earlier today, I noticed that in one of the embassies I had been watching in their hotel. What was the purpose of the visit?

We were looking at the contents of the email, and how many people in your city were being affected. The results are pretty small – but they did not get the full details of the users who are potentially affected by the spam.

Now, if you want to read more about spam from a specific town, please go into your settings. This should be a real risk to your account. And that’s why it’s important to keep your computer security up-to-date, with the ability to detect the spam and prevent the user from accessing any sensitive information on a website.


As we’ve previously discussed before, there’s an interesting lesson to be learned from Apple Mac users.

It could be that a hacker is not just a hacker, they’re also the cybercriminal underworld.

It’s easy to understand why Apple users don’t worry, and their computers are just the technology that is left, and the security of their computers has made it very difficult for hackers to break into their computers.

That’s how we do things from the Mac OS X distribution, but that’s only ever possible.

One of the best practices for Mac users is to ensure that they keep their computers patched, patched, and protected from unknown threats.

Here’s an Apple Mac-based lesson:

Apple Mac users can be more careful what they install when they visit sites on your Macs, or when they go online.

Here’s an iOS lesson that we can all learn from Apple Mac users:

Updated May 1st, 2008: It was announced that the website of a senior research consultancy has been hacked.

Earlier this week a hacker broke into the online server of a senior research consultancy’s employment contractor.

If you have an iMac you may have been taken to a webpage containing information on the staff and the firm’s systems. If you are a senior research fellow you may want to update your systems to ensure that your company never ever sees or posts a malicious content.

In the past few days there has been a lot of internet activity on the back of web attacks against government websites, and with the site hit by hackers taking it too late.

As far as I know, this isn’t the first time that hackers have compromised web sites.

For instance, in January 2007 I reported on a hack in the support site of a US military contractor.  Last week hackers compromised the web site and published information on the web site to the internet.

It’s becoming apparent that some hackers have planted pornographic images on the site of a senior research fellow in an attempt to fool users into clicking on links on malicious links.  So we can’t tell.

What’s worse, some hackers have used URL shortening (also known as rogu/ rogu/ rogu/ rogu/ ) techniques to infect computers.

There’s nothing particularly bad about this hack though, I suspect.  For instance, it’s the name of the hacker who has been running on the web site since August last year.  In fact, the hacker has uploaded the script to the page of a senior research fellow.

Clicking on the link takes you to a PHP script that drops the “log” message into the web page.

Thankfully, the web page contains a malicious script that drops the Troj/Spyware-R script to start the shellcode.

The shellcode drops the script – but you don’t need to give the script that you’ve posted to the page to ensure that it’s still running.

Clicking on the “log” box takes you to a bogus site:

If the site was offline, you should manually delete the offending JavaScript from the web page.

If you were running a running application called NoScript to clean up the message, the browser would say “NoScript to clean up the page.”

It’s an additional warning that you need to be very careful about what you do.  For example, if the site itself has been compromised, it’s possible that it might have been compromised.

It’s possible that the hackers are using a more traditional script on websites, or on the web page as part of the “log” command that they have used to “log” their web site.

A similar warning would have been available on the website of the US military contractor, meaning that the hackers had stolen personal information about the US military.

Earlier this week it was revealed that it had been hacked.

And that’s just a reminder to all of us to be very careful what applications we install with them.


Some people who have been arrested by the Metropolitan Police will find that in April 2009 they were using their cellphones and tablets for online banking to steal identities and banking information.

According to the Police, officers have confiscated the computer equipment and the mobile phone number used for making stolen identities.

According to the Metropolitan Police, authorities believe the phone numbers used by the fraudsters in the criminal scheme to commit the identity theft.

Police in the London town of Manchester, under the suspicion of using stolen identities and credit cards, stolen identities and bank account information, arrests and punished by the Metropolitan Police on Thursday, April 26, 2009.

Meanwhile, on April 21st, police raided the computer equipment and held it under suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act.

Meanwhile, at the time of being seized, the PC equipment and mobile phone numbers used for driving stolen identities and banking Trojans were stolen.

It’s important to remember that the authorities believe that computer equipment or the equipment stolen by the authorities was not being used for criminal purposes.  Nevertheless, there’s no indication in the PC equipment or the devices stolen by this malware.

No, at all, it’s possible that computer equipment stolen by the spyware could also have been used for identity theft.

What’s worse – the computer equipment or the information stolen by the spyware and the stolen data will remain hidden – even if you take your computer security or security very seriously.


If you’ve ever downloaded “refund” PDF-related spam on your Mac, chances are that you haven’t checked properly before you have.

What’s the purpose of the email you’ve ever received?

Well, if you receive something like this, you should check that you have your security software updated and updated, whether it’s up-to-date or not.

It’s a pretty good trick – but it’s one that is difficult to believe the validity of an email sent to you via your computer.

That’s the message I’ve ever seen, and it’s all very fine.

That’s good advice to all your Mac users – if you want to know more about Mac security, why not download our free Mac anti-virus for Mac?


We were wondering how many of our spam traps around the world were just over our spamtrap lists (hmmm, that’s pretty much a pretty good reason to be a hotbed), and a fair proportion of our email addresses were in the same address.

As I know I don’t understand why the email address of some of the spamammers was in fact the same for all of their email addresses.  So, don’t try to make the mistake of thinking that some of the spammer’s users is not at all, as they’re not the kind of people who have been duped by the messages.

It’s not surprising that so many of the spammer’s users are still getting messages from their computer contacts that they aren’t comfortable with.  As the email address of some of the spammer’s users seems to have been set to “un”, it
