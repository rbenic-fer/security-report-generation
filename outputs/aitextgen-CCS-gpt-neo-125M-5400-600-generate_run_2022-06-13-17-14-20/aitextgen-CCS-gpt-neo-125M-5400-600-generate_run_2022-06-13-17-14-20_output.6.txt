In the opinion of the expert,   the good news is that they have a good reason to keep the system under the highest standards for their efforts, as this is the best possible for some of their staff.

But as we said in the article about the most difficult problems and concerns to have handled before, I must admit I was not surprised by how the IT team felt about a security breach in the system.

I hope that our IT team are reviewing the security of their systems and protecting their security as a matter of course.

Thanks to Naked Security reader Pete for making me aware of this situation.


Our friends at SophosLabs are constantly watching the latest security news. These days I am a bit closer to the UK’s largest security conference (we have the largest ever held in the UK), and we have been able to deliver the most relevant security analyses of the UK.

We have produced a detailed list of the top ten security conferences in the UK, Canada, Asia and the USA. We also ran the annual events which has a great video of how you can make a better understanding of the UK’s top twelve, IT-related security enthusiasts.

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

Here are a small sampling of the information on which we have included the most relevant security vendors:

There are many places in the UK that we haven’t had any problems with your organisation.  Many people spend the UK time at home, and for the last few months have been busy in the workable from your desk.


I was wondering what I am, how I know what the name of the country I work in, and what the language of the country I am at is.

The UK, for its part, has a Top 10 in the list, with the title “Operation Stuxnet”.

We were pleased that SophosLabs published our findings – so I thought it is pretty odd that in this poll we were asked to consider the other four top ten in the Top 10.

But there were three places:

You can see a lot of details, but one of them is a domain that we are able to see.

You can see that the bottom of the list has the following characteristics:

Heg. ‘Wep’ is a.cn domain, and the.cn domain is a.cn domain.

There are also a number of different domain names being used for the.cn domain:

Some of the people listed are in the Top 10.

In fact, SophosLabs has published information about their countries as well.

Now there’s a little question mark.  The domain names of those countries I work in were highly related.  According to our Security Threat Report 2009, in fact, it was pretty good news if I am a proud citizen, so I can now say that I am not proud of that.

I must admit that I am proud of the US government.  What is the top ten, of course, and how to make a better understanding?


We have been monitoring over the last few weeks for a number of the malicious Trojans that are distributed to the victim’s inboxes. The first time we received a message to “SophosLabs,” this morning, was this:

I am pleased to see the number of such Trojans being spammed out, so I had to check with my colleagues in the SophosLabs to see if any of them were being spammed out. The more people that get in, the more money they get, the more people will have that will have to fall for scams.

A few days ago we have seen new malware attempting to spread in the form of Weps. One of them has a variant detected as WepS. It drops the file WepS.EXE and drops the WepS.EXE file to the victim’s network shares. The infected file WepS.EXE was proactively detected as WepS as Mal/WepS-H. A further variant detected as WepS.EXE was proactively detected as Mal/WepS-U. Once this variant had a legitimate copy, it dropped WepS.EXE to the victim’s network shares and started to take more actions to prevent the same infection happening again.

So now I had the opportunity to look at the malware payload, it took a lot of manual analysis, this time from the time of the infection. This is a lot of time for anti-virus users to consider whether a certain Trojan had broken the WepS file. The main purpose of that is to make the detection key not fool me as to what the original WepS file is:

When this file is placed it will attempt to infect the victim with the original Mal/WepS file. This method of infection will not rely on WepS in its original form if it contains a legitimate virus or a threat. When the downloaded file is opened and executed the Trojan will launch and infect the user with Mal/WepS.

In the above email the message box is the same as above. The actual message box is the same, but with the original WepS file, the payload will attempt to infect the victim with WepS.EXE file.

However, the main purpose is to infect the victim with Mal/WepS. So the first time the file is unpacked, it is automatically executed with the malicious WepS.EXE file, which the Trojan has the filename “Spam_reg.exe”. So the Trojans will attempt to take advantage of the WepS.EXE file and run their malware-infection.


It has been announced that there was another new virus in the wild (also known as the W32/W32/GJ) recently – Troj/Wepaw-A, which is another example of the growing number of computer viruses that we had heard of before.

We have been detecting this family of worms for quite some time, but its only ever to be observed. I do not believe that the Dorf-related W32/Wepaw-A family of worms (also known as Wepaw-A) exists in any way to be spammed out to computers around the world.

The Dorf family has received over 10,000 monthly active users, so its payload was the same as Wepaw-A. The Wepaw-A family has been distributed in the wild every day for a variety of purposes, such as financial and medical purposes. We detected this family as Wepaw-A (aka Wepaw-A or Wepaw-A) using the Wepaw-A family.

So if you fall for the Wepaw-A family of worms then it doesn’t seem to be that good, and the only way to tell is to install the original Wepaw-A virus and fix it. So far we have received no files, no spam and no new applications. This was a lot more likely, as it appears that Wepaw-A is not the only family of worms that are used in the Dorf-infection.

But it was interesting to see the spread of Wepaw-A before it could spread. For the purposes of this post, I have only encountered a few instances of Wepaw-A. The first, Wepaw-A is a variant of the Wepaw-A family of malware. The second Wepaw-A families of malware was Wepaw-A, Wepaw-A was a variant of Wepaw-A. Wepaw-A was a family of viruses. Wepaw-A generated a number of samples with Wepaw-A and the worm Wepaw-A was a variant with Wepaw-A. The second Wepaw-A sample was Wepaw-A.


Today I saw that a number of people have been sent to the website of the “Fox Hunt”, a site dedicated to “enemies and the media giant are looking at the site in question. This will change the site to the same place again, so the script that you enter at this time point needs to be different.

From a web page you could see that the website is set to load the new script that I saw before. On the same page the site is set to load a new script from the same domain at the same time.

Now the script from the same domain is set to load another new script, but is the same as the current script from the same domain. It also targets is a web page from the same domain as the site we are directed to and the web page is not set to load the script from the same domain. In fact it is not just the script in the same domain, I’ll be off and go back and go back and update the page again, as it’s still very important.

I’ve found a lot of work which can be done by people at the web website. The good news is that I have blocked my email and used the old old ones. No need to do anything from a web page, of course.

But if you are running a web page you may also notice
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  “I am not a fan of the e-mail and my dog are dead.”

According to the Wall Street Journal, “that if you are a user of the e-mail you should be on your own computer for your information later.”

No one has ever spoken to me saying.  It just happened that the company is not going to do a business with people who make calls or send photographs and photos.  So, as the Wall Street Journal reports, a former employee who has refused to hand over personal information to others has been able to break the law under the FTC’s Act.

It’s possible that the police will be more careful and ensure that any information about the “Personal Data” which was not protected under the FTC’s Act is not considered private information.

The Internet Storm Center has announced its intention to put off the automatic tracking of the “backing and abating” of websites on the social networks, compromised by hackers that it believed were used to promote the hack.

Although the company is believed to have compromised the webpages the hackers appear to have gained access to the computers on the compromised websites by using SQL injection and the malicious code.

And it’s good news that the site is offline – as it has been used to serve up material on the “redacted” of its systems in the past.

In a world news forum we made earlier this week, the website’s website has been compromised by hackers who have planted malicious code on the webpages on the websites of hackers who had been responsible for some of the attacks.

Of course, it’s only the last time that “redacted” of the “redacted” of “redacted” of “redacted” are targeted by hackers.

It’s not the first time that hackers have planted malware on websites on a social networks.  For instance, in 2008, hackers planted malicious code on a website that was being used by hackers to spam out messages from a number of Facebook users and spread spam.

One thing that should have been for certain: if you weren’t careful about how you should protect your company against online attacks, and your website was compromised, hackers could have planted SQL injection attacks on it – that would have made up the worse.


Earlier this week Naked Security blogged about a website belonging to the American Bank of Ireland, in which the online payment service was fraudulently phished by hackers.

The information stolen by the hackers was that the company used the online payment service to deliver its checks and claim “a significant amount of money” in a Nigerian bank in Spain.

We will now know as to why the site was stolen by hackers.

Further investigation has been published online, after it was discovered that the information stolen by the hackers was being used to log into other online bank accounts.

Of course the people who have not been properly held were at a different point of view – perhaps the more time that a member of the online community is having a chance of making money from stolen credit card numbers.


Sophos’s annual Security Threat Report published yesterday, revealed the vast numbers of infected PCs across the globe.

Here’s an updated view of the latest stats, published by SophosLabs:

By the way, if you missed this post in the past few days, please remember to keep your computer up to date with patches and advisories.

Update: Read the Sophos Security Threat Report 2011, which outlines the top ten in the top ten countries for computer security on January 7, 2011.

Update: Read the “dirty dozen” report.


SophosLabs has witnessed a mass-spam campaign using the phrase “spam”.

It’s a widespread campaign targeting the US and British government.  So how many computers are infected?  A good proportion of them are, after all, infected by malware, spammed out on compromised machines.

The latest spam messages used in these messages are being spammed out in a number of different languages.  This is a variant of the Dorf malware family – if you’ve ever seen a malware infection of your computer then you’ll know that the malware will take the right to run your malware before infecting you with a virus.

In the following video, the subject line is the following:

By the way, the spam messages may vary between messages.

So, if you find the spammer wants to use a common language (e.g. “spam”), please don’t click on the link in the email.  Don’t be surprised if you’ve seen something too good.

Update: Here’s a similar spammed out in the form of a bogus email, which claims to be from a different vendor.

Earlier this week we published an update to our “dirty dozen” report, discussing the various threats in a daily podcast:

(19 January 2011, duration 12:25 minutes, size 11.8MBytes)


We are at RSA recently, and as the video’s name suggests, they have released us some time for the most wanted Chet Chat podcast – a special guest of the week, Chet Chat – during RSA’s annual annual “Patch Tuesday”.

The Chet Chat was released on Wednesday, which includes some content from our booth speaking and a range of talks including an interview, seminar and podcast.  I also joined you as Chet Chat episode 13.

Watch as Chet has joined us on Thursday, November 2:00 ( GMT), as Chet and Chet Chat episode 12 were a special guests, as Chet has joined us for the Chet Chat episode.

You can also download this podcast directly in MP3 format: Sophos Security Chet Chat 22. All of Chet’s past podcasts are available from http://podcasts.sophos.com.


SophosLabs are continuing to analyse all malware campaigns we will be seeing for in the last 12 months, as malware authors will continue to exploit every day of the year.

This is the largest growth in malware we are seeing, but not the largest, most popular, the most popular one we see, in terms of which we detect our malware samples are.

So, it seems as though cybercriminals are taking advantage of this new interest in the financial markets to put their money into the hands of those who wish to spend time in this week’s show.

For some of our readers, we are still detecting our files as malware (also known as Pushdo or Chernobyl malware, in the way that the authors are using it), and as Chet’s post on his blog, his blog was updated on Nov 10th to point to some new features in the product.

To help protect our personal information during our educational activities, Chet has joined us on Nov 19th, 2011, and has been closely monitored for every day of the year. Chet has been involved in this podcast as well as from the security of his blog post to blog articles.

In addition, Chet has joined us on Nov 15th to discuss the rising number of malware on smartphones and tablets during our educational sessions. Chet has also joined us on Nov 18th with Chet’s Chet Chat episode “Banking on the Security of a Live computer”. Chet has joined Chet’s Chet Chat episode “Fanking on the Security of a Live computer”.

====================
In the opinion of the expert,  the use of “solicited” keywords by various internet sites could lead to a higher level of confidence than legitimate.

It’s good to see a strong push for more of your personal information over the net as many people around the world are vulnerable to fraud and phishing attacks.  But if you haven’t already done so, don’t worry too much – don’t give them your personal information.

If you’ve found out how to deal with the problem of scams being used by cybercriminals you should ensure that they aren’t posing as genuine security vendors.  It could have been, for instance, that hackers were using compromised internet sites that appeared genuine security vendors wanted to steal.

Here’s a typical email, which tries to trick you into believing that you have received your contact details and then sends a message to your online friends:

Your details can be easily attached to a message – if you lose your passport it’s likely that cybercriminals have planted dangerous software on your computer.  It’s possible that cybercriminals are using this method to spread spam – but a real problem to me.  After all, it’s pretty simple to email a number of email addresses.

Update: The link above was used in a bogus email. The domain of the domain is registered to a website that was registered to a criminal.

Further investigation revealed that the hackers in question also appear to have planted images of hackers on the computer screens and emails used to spam them.  If you haven’t, you can report the email to the legitimate security vendor.

Update: The email was from a professional email address.com with a fake SSL certificate.

Update: The email appears to have been sent from a Russian country – a domain which normally uses Russian language.


Facebook users may be at risk of scams being spammed out by hackers exploiting the “solicited messages” to trick users into clicking on messages to spam or spread malware.

If you visit the following link from a Russian-speaking Russian user:

Facebook users who wish to see a video of the attacks could manually play a video and install the Sophos Anti-Virus.

By the way, if you click on the video, the video you are actually taken to the website of a Russian-speaking Russian-speaking Russian-American, with the promise of a video codec, or a shocking video of the Russian-American party taking the online assault.

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)

This isn’t a Facebook problem – so why would Facebook post a message to your online friends?  If they did click they actually made the mistake of clicking on the link.

But what’s clear – if you click on the video, you are really running the risk of being hit by this malware, or spreading the malware via your web browser on a compromised computer, or infecting your computer with spyware.

Update: Facebook users have seen messages posted via the “solicited messages” URL linking to a site called Vodafone.com, which was registered to a Russian-speaking Russian-speaking Russian user.

There’s a lesson for Facebook users:  If your computer is carrying an assortment of spyware, spyware and cybercriminals you should not post messages to your Facebook page, or send spam or attachments to your Facebook friends.  But if you click on a link from a Russian-speaking Russian member that appears to be an official YouTube video of the attacks, or is a dangerous reminder to exercise extreme caution over the internet and ensure that your computer is defended.


Today we released our annual Security Threat Report. The week I joined in our annual podcast, discussing the increasing number of emails from malware on the social networks and social networks, and what the web security industry has learn to learn about.

We also have some of the thoughts on how to choose a memorable subject.

The hackers who posted a message to Twitter yesterday posted an explanation to the Twitter accounts of hackers who have posted photographs of the group’s users.

A message to the Twitter user’s wall reads:

"Good enough to go back and re-post the photo, http://twitter.com/#!/twitter_dodgy_twitter!"

The tweet reads:

Hello, this message got sent from Twitter, however I do not want your password to be more public.  I want to see the message posted to your Twitter account for the first time in my lifetime, <LINK>

It doesn't seem like the only reason that they posted a message.  But I am sure that they have posted a message that was more relevant.  It could be that they posted an explanation rather than just a harmless error.  However, it could be that they posted an explanation that the message was posted to their Twitter friends.

If you use Twitter and follow the link from the Twitter website of a Russian hacker, make sure that you are running a strong anti-spam filters to ensure that you are not easily fooled.


Last month we published a report examining how many people seem to be being hit by a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) in the form of a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) [1]. The DDoS attack was an attack using a DDoS attack to hijack the Twitter accounts of the groups behind the attacks.

The group’s group has been in the running for over 20,000 traffic from the @Twitter account on July 29th [2]. The DDoS attack was launched in March, where they used the tools they have published on their website, the DDoS attack is said to have succeeded.

A statement posted on the official Twitter website has said “Our support team will be reviewing the situation and will ensure that a proper investigation is launched as soon as we discover the evidence generated by the participating parties.” The DDoS attack is a DDoS attack. It could be that the group’s “e-mail accounts” were being used to spew out traffic from the Twitter account, making it a part of the damage launched.

If you have fallen for the DDoS attack you are very much at risk.  If you fall for a DDoS attack on your Twitter account you are exposing your computer to hackers who have used it for up-to-date security updates and control systems.

What should be done, however, is is that if your Twitter account had been compromised and you are not in the running for up-to-date updates, your Twitter account would be compromised too.  So, if you are able to make use of the DDoS attack for free, update your Twitter page immediately.  But do not believe the rumours that it’s not a DDoS attack.  I must admit I felt that having a DDoS attack on a Twitter user’s account was very dangerous.

There is no denying that hackers using DDoS attacks are very much involved in the attacks.  As I mentioned yesterday, Twitter users should be very careful about the DDoS attack as many of them will have had their accounts clogging up the net.  Indeed, it’s possible that a hacker will have used the DDoS attack to make the point of his attack more serious.

Update: Twitter posted an explanation for the DDoS attack on July 2nd – another Twitter user tweeted on July 8th.

There’s no denying that Twitter’s “e-mail accounts” were hacked – but there’s no denying that there was no evidence of the attacks against the users of their Twitter accounts.

What’s interesting to me is that so many of the folks around the world are seeing that the Twitter users have fallen for DDoS attacks like this every day.  But that’s only to make them believe that they are using the DDoS attack to spew out spam, spread malware and launch a DDoS attack.

Make sure that you keep informed about the latest DDoS attacks in the USA.  Do not fall for them – if you have fallen for them, visit http://www.twitter.com/dodgy_twitter (presumably)

Update: Twitter’s Twitter page has been hit by a DDoS attack (for some time).  I do not believe that Twitter has responded.

Update: Twitter’s own Twitter page has been hit.

It’s clear that there’s an impact on the Twitter users, and the many people reading the security blog will be at a high alert for their situation – in particular those who use the service.

Update: Twitter was hit by a DDoS attack on July 8th [3].

There’s no denying that Twitter has fallen for the DDoS attack on July 8th [4].  But it’s clear that many of Twitter’s users are comfortable with the DDoS – rather than having their own Twitter accounts compromised.

If you haven’t already done so, read this article from the Daily Telegraph in which we revealed that Twitter has issued a warning about a “very low number” of DDoS attack [5].
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  they had lost the ability to find the data at the other end by uploading the ‘leak’ of photos to the company.  They would have been at risk of the wrong data loss by the company’s customers.

The same sort of mistake is being played out in the headlines.

Here’s the full video of the hack being made by Chris Merta:

(Enjoy this video?  You can check out more on the SophosLabs YouTube channel and subscribe if you like)


Yesterday it was reported that Facebook had hired hackers to break into its systems and post messages to their website in the last 24 hours.

Regular readers of the Facebook blog will recall that Facebook has chosen a “Bad news” headline as a “we are really sick now”.  It is, perhaps, news of a hack which was first revealed earlier today by Facebook itself.

The hoax was initially reported in October to be spread via the social network of a leading US military contractor, and Facebook claims it has suffered from a hack.

It appears that Facebook did not take action to clean the user when Facebook began receiving messages from their staff about the hack from the firm from their own Facebook friends.

One of the many leading Facebook users said that it was looking for information about the hack, and it has posted messages to the Facebook website confirming the hack.

A similar message posted to the website reads, as though the user sent a message via an SMS message, informing them that their Facebook page had been “very quiet now”, Facebook said.

So I was very surprised and stumbled upon Facebook saying, “I would like Facebook to take the threat seriously.”  But what I was surprised at was that Facebook had responded in an official update to the Facebook page’s “Bad news”, warning users that there was nothing to post to their page.  And it’s not possible that Facebook could have had the wrong messages posted to the Facebook page via its systems.

Of course, it appears the Facebook page is not vulnerable to this hack – Facebook has informed the users that their Facebook page has been compromised and posted messages to their Facebook profiles, warning their friends that their account may have been compromised and may have had their computer stolen.

But the only lesson here is that it’s never too late – Facebook has tried to warn users that there are no messages to their Facebook page – or, better yet – it would be prudent to check that the link used for sharing the message has not been posted in any attempt by the rogue Facebook software firm to trick the users into taking the “good” action of Facebook taking the message seriously.

In other words, Facebook should have issued more information about the hack into its pages and published information about the hack, in the hope of causing a higher levels of damage.

It’s possible that Facebook was wronging its official page on its own site when the hackers entered it on the site – but Facebook does seem to have taken action to correct the problem, and now there was nothing to post to the Facebook page.


Updated Today the Internet Storm Center (ISCated by the IRedcross) was released their annual report. The Internet Storm Center had the world’s leading up until the end of 2010 to report the success of the cybercriminal group.  The IRedcross is not the only country to be hit, and it’s a shame that the IRedcross is in the headlines for its action.   

I came across the European market where I will give you the name of that country, in an attempt to give a view of how the cybercriminal group has evolved from the to its current crime.  I don’t know how to speak to the anti-virus industry, but the IRedcross was back in 2002 to report this.

The IRedcross had a script and a logic that had made it a relatively difficult for anti-virus. I do not know how the IRedcross had any intention of conducting a script, but it has been very serious to the IRedcross for all of its computer code.   

The IRedcross also posted on its website about the hacking of its internet connection with a web site (the www.redcross’s) – so it could be pretty sure that its website was in fact compromised.  But it certainly isn’t the kind of computer hackers that we see in the public.  As I have discussed before, cybercriminals don’t just target the web site from which they could spy on the people that may spy on the IRedcross’s computer system for the purposes of identity theft, but it also also has the capability of a botnet – a set of botnets of which it should be able to find.

I must admit, I’m not entirely surprised at the thought of the the IRedcross hack.  The IRedcross hack just means that a little too no computer user should install the new IRedcross.  But I must admit, “Yes – I know that the IRedcross hack was an act of some form, but it’s never done with the real IRedcross.”

There’s a lesson here here: if your computer relies upon a website (e.g. one called a website on which your computer is connected to a website on which your computer is connected to a website on which you are computer) then you might be at risk.

Even if you fall for the confidence trick of a computer security vendor for your computer to become infected with malware, you’ll be at risk.

And remember – if you are a computer security vendor at your company, consider changing the registry, or running a security checker.

PS. If you haven’t already done so, we have been aware of some of the IRedcross that can happen to your PC if a malicious hacker managed to hack the computer’s system, potentially infect it.


The bad guys around the world have been targeting Facebook users in a malicious spam campaign.

The messages are posted to the official Facebook page by Facebook’s users.  The link takes you to a website that requests your account information from Facebook and it’s then sent to a web page, claiming that it was sent to a website that claims that you need to take a survey.

The purpose of the spam messages is to trick you into believing that they are from legitimate Facebook users, and give you a “hand fee”.

The scam messages follow the link to make the scammer’s buck out by displaying fake “for me at your desk” dialogs.

If you click the link you are taken to a site which claims to be an “i-rated” Facebook page – but I think it’s an extremely bogus page too.  That’s why Facebook is warning about this problem on Facebook, of course.  Facebook clearly doesn’t make the mistake of taking a survey – a page which claims that it hasn’t been “via Google” yet.

But there’s a lesson here – there’s nothing more that Facebook can’t prove against the security of its users, by saying that it may not be “via Google.”   And it’s possible that the people behind these scams will be less likely to be compromised by cybercriminals than in “via the box.”

The bad news is that it seems to me that there isn’t really a sign of more serious about the Facebook I’ve been struggling to fix Facebook’s security, and that I am not going to be able to guarantee that it doesn’t try to compromise people via my PC that’s on.  And I don’t have to worry that Facebook may make more serious mistakes in its computer security that I’ve been struggling with lately.

One thing to say is that I don’t want Facebook users to be phished for in this manner.

I hope to see Facebook taking the appropriate steps to protect its users in future.

There’s no denying that Facebook users are much more concerned about the security of their Facebook pages than those of innocent users.  This could be the first time that Facebook has warned users of the problem, by recommending that they turn on a “hand payment” dialog box.


Updated The Facebook “laptop” of “Facebook”?

If you click a quick look at your password, then you get redirected to a fraudulent payment processing site.

Of course, this isn’t a legitimate Facebook page, as there isn’t much to say about it – there was a link to a Facebook page linking to a rogue site that they believe you’ve been hit by an attack (click here for more information about the real deal).

However, if you did click a quick search on the page, you get redirected to a rogue-looking website.

The website’s real-time checksum asks you for your credit card details.  But, the fake-from-
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  the proposed changes are likely the beginning of the year.

Let us hope to see the  changes in the way the anti-virus product handles the threat of computer security for more than a few years.


The release of the Mac OS X 10.5.6 operating system – this time being known as ‘the Firewall’ – is out.

In addition to that, there are also several security patches in this latest update, which can be applied for Windows 7, OS X 10.6 or earlier, which will be released tomorrow (Monday 7th October).

For those of you not familiar with Mac OS X, SophosLabs have seen five critical updates for Snow Leopard over the past few weeks.

This brings us to the release of Snow Leopard, Windows 7, Windows 7 SP2, and Windows 8.5.

You have to wonder whether this includes any security fixes that you would expect from Apple or any other operating system that an application requires to run.

Of course, the issue of critical updates in the last few days is of course not a thing that exists in your computer.

A lot of users, particularly those running older versions of Windows, would recommend that they set up their Mac computers with up-to-date anti-virus and anti-rootkit protection, and make sure that they are properly patched.

It’s a bit confusing to find out if you simply cannot install updates from Apple, and install them from the Apple App Store.  But, it also means that it’s possible that Apple updates were published without their users having accessed their Apple Mac computers.

If you lose control of your Mac computers then you need to upgrade Apple Macs to fix them.  They may include security patches or patches for your Mac or for other computers, but this is just one of the reasons why many people use Macs.


Updated: The OS X 10.5.4 patch is out, however that does not mean that the patch should be released sooner rather than later.

The update is available as a download to download and it includes an update for the XProtect (XProtect) file format.

All of your users who have upgraded to the new version of Mac OS X 10.5.4 are protected with a version of OS X 10.5.5.

The update is available from Adobe.

Don’t forget, if you lose control of your Mac or Windows PC then Apple would have done the hard thing by disabling it on any unencrypted Macs that were not allowed to access your system.

Note: Some users are struggling to upgrade to an alternative version of the XProtect in XProtect, as the Mac version includes a copy of the OSX 10.5.4 update for OS X 10.5.6 and earlier XProtect.

Update: Read the update here, and if you feel comfortable downloading the update, download it from http://updated’s website.

If you believe your computer’s security you should know and ask it for you to give SophosLabs expert information.

We have a couple of things to ask you to do about computer security:

One thing that can be tricky is to tell the computer security firm that a computer virus is on your PC.  It’s quite possible that there’s a problem – of course, it can’t – if your computer has been compromised by malware (such as a Trojan or worm) it’s possible that you could be attacked by malware as well.

But in an attempt to trick computer users into thinking that a computer security company hasn’t had any problems with your PC (and its computer owners have been working in the past) you’ll find an issue that’s probably bigger than your PC, and it’s possible that a computer security firm has found the problem tricky.

So, to put the computer security at its heart, it should take some time to update your anti-virus product to keep its protection in proportion.  If that’s the case then you should check that your anti-virus product has “redated” it.

Update 2: Many users of the free Anti-Virus for Mac Home Edition or Windows 7 would recommend that they upgrade to Sophos Anti-Virus for Windows XP or Windows 8 if they have been fully patched.

Update 2: It’s seemed that the upgrade is fully rolled out for the second time in a row – Microsoft has issued an update which fixes a number of critical issues.

Unfortunately, the upgrade to Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac (OSX 10.5) was available for anyone who downloaded the software and installed it on a computer infected with the Troj/FakeAV Trojan horse.


Last week I wrote up a report that revealed a new piece of malware that can spread via networks in the UK, or via removable drives. The bad news is that the spammed out malicious attachments in the way of an email attachment, or via removable email attachments.

It was a busy week for SophosLabs Australia, but let me say with a loudhearted. The first problem is how widespread is malware to spread. With such a low amount of malware on a computer and so on, malware authors have moved on. With all the new malware, users need to think twice about the importance of properly securing their computers against the latest threats.

In a move that could make many of us believe that malware authors are using more and more sophisticated, perhaps by exploiting some new technology and malware techniques to spread their malware.

This is a common theme.

The bad news is that although there was no malware written to spread via removable drives, we do see something new. By default, the most effective techniques are to use either the Firewire or USB flash drives.

There are several methods available to use to spread the malware. One of the methods is to load a drive-by download. You can get a variety of files – such as the ‘.lnk’ and ‘.brk’ – from an removable disk or USB flash drive. This is, in turn, your own piece of code – as it can easily be changed to point to the C: drive and point to the malicious file. The second method is to load and write to the file in order to see the ‘.lnk’ and ‘.brk’.

Now imagine that there are many of them.

We can expect to see more and more people trying to download and run malware on computers in the UK than we are trying to detect for malware.

The only way to start, is for those of us who have already paid for the file to keep the file secure. The good news is that we don’t have any way of detecting malware in sight. That should make the file safe and more secure than relying on USB keys. For example, some of the methods in this story seem to be related to ‘automatically’. We have even seen some cases where this method was a bit complex, such as when it was just run on the PC.


There’s a new variant of the ‘Loveback’ family of malware?

That’s where the title is, of course, because of an attachment which claims to be a Windows Shortcut.  A quick look at the Windows Shortcut, reveals that the dropped file is in fact a Windows Shortcuter file (detected as Troj/Downer-D since January 2002).

The purpose is just to make the infected computer unusable (for instance, it was the file was subsequently downloaded from a remote location- server hosted in Ireland.

I am not saying “the virus would have been there to run and no-one was out.” But this is unlikely.

When we tested the worm on computers in our lab it didn’t seem to have gone far enough, so we did not have to manually examine it.

As we did in the Zafi family of malware (also known as “Loveback”) we have been detecting for over a quarter of a dozen malware families every day. The last five samples we were able to detect were Troj/Zafi-A (also known as Mal/Zafi-A), Troj/Kango-A (also known as the ‘Loveback’ family of malware) and Troj/Zafi-B (also known as “Spy”).

The Zafi family of malware does not contain any piece of software or hardware related to the Zafi family of malware.

It was a quiet day, but we didn’t lose anything, so we took the time to put this more directly into a safe place.  It was a busy day for SophosLabs.

I would recommend, however, that this piece of malware was a little less malware.  If we are honest, we would be not use the name “Loveback” in any other way, you would think it would be a surprise to see the bad guys trying to infect computers around the world.


The first reason I am on the horizon is that most of the world’s web sites are infected with the Mal/If
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  and its support of its proposed bill that would allow any user to view the view of the view of the view of the view of their view, is irresponsible.

The proposed bill, passed by American voters, is designed to give law enforcement agencies the power to take the full view of the view of the view of the view of the view of the view of the view of the view of the view, even if they believe the views were acceptable for their actions.

The proposed bill would allow any user to view the view of the view of the view of the view of the view. A complete view is available on the website of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and is recommended to this effect.

The proposed bill would be rejected to the next month (such as the next year), but the proposed bill does not allow any new feature to be used for police purposes.

The House of Representatives is taking effect soon, but this isn’t likely to be released later this year.

And if you haven’t already read the new piece of the bill you can download this report, as it is available on www.sophos.com.

Note that this poll is not scientific to any of the consumer or security problems in the company’s comments, so please read them carefully:

There’s a lot of speculation that this bill will not be used in court at all, in this case a result of the proposed changes.

Update: There have been several reports of the proposed bill being rejected for the next two weeks.

There are lots of questions over the last 12 months, but if it was, this would be a good start.  What’s so wrong, if your company are to be the least careful about how its users are accessing their websites or – in this case, to their website.


I’m back recently from the US air and my wife has returned from a trip to our offices for a few days.

I know it's the kind of thing I would expect if I don't want my wife to lose my passport because she did lose her passport!  She just passed on the email to me.

Well, if I had to lose her passport I would have to lose my passport because of it.  Maybe it could have been much more embarrassing.

Here’s the email I received that I've received in the past week:

We are going to collect your contact details, so please please lose your passport details.  If you lose the passport, please lose the passport with your wife or friend.

Thank you for transferring to our website now.

As usual, please lose your passport details.  You will need to submit your information to the US Department of Homeland Security website where you can keep you informed of your lost or stolen passport. 
We will use this as a reason for your new passport.  We will provide information on how we can implement your standard of passport policies. 
I will add you to this list of current state laws.

Update: I wish I was a bit smaller.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has temporarily halted access to the US Department of Homeland Security website from being held insecure.  In the worst cases you can lose your passport and need to pay over the wire to get back from the passport.

Update 2: The Department of Homeland Security website was unavailable as well. The Department of Homeland Security has released a statement stating that the security was closed in a routine manner.

Update 3: I don't want my wife to lose my passport because of the accident I've been made at the moment.  I wish I're really small.


According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, “A hacking gang has broken into the US government’s website and left a photo on its webcam, stolen information about the US’s top secret weapons system, and stole details about US military personnel that had been at risk.”

According to the Wall Street Journal, “A hacking group had stolen details about US Air One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night One-night”

In a statement published to Wall Street Journal newspaper The Washington Times, Wall Street Journal quoted a hacker who hacked into the US government’s website and published an invisible message to its website:

"An anonymous hack of the website was not simply a step too far for the US government to know about a hacker and a hacker, but it also caused millions of dollars damage to the US government. We have made the information publicly available for the public to see the full view of the view of the full view of the view of the full view of the full view of the full view of the full view. By default, a hacker's name or a name or a name can be used to spread the link to all of the websites serving the online story or information in the database."

According to The Wall Street Journal, a hacker’s name was published on the computer network’s website on Nov 13, 2011.

Clearly a hacking group has taken an action against their website and published it to other website owners.  Many other websites have suffered over this breach, including Twitter and Facebook, have had security issues for some time, and it seems their own that there was an issue on some of their servers, and it was difficult to identify how the hack occurred.

Some people who are concerned about the leaking of details about the US Army are suggesting that they visit their US authorities to keep them informed of the latest hack.

It’s a shame some folks are just so nervous about what else they could find at the internet, and how it can be viewed more easily, or a manual process to prove their identity online.


I’m not saying I am a fan of Facebook, or anyone else I know.

I am a fan of Apple’s Mac OS X (Apple Mac App Store) but I am not saying I am not a fan.

It’s easy to see why Apple should have kept me up-to-date with security patches as this morning.

The OS X version of Mac OS X 10.6 and older versions of Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) is 10.6.6 (Snow Leopard is 10.6).

With that, they have announced that they are adding two security updates, all in an attempt to provide better security in the Mac OS X version.

All of this has been updated to the latest version (64 versions of OS X 10.6.4 and 10.7.7).

We will update this article once a week, as the number of users (the last 7.5 in the chart) is growing, to make it even harder for the bad guys to break into your online life.

And if you haven’t updated your Mac OS X version, or your Mac anti-virus software (i.e. your anti-virus software), you should check out our latest security research.

The bad guys have started making calls to the “SophosLabs Twitter feed” claiming to contain information about the “Personalities of Americans”.

I don’t believe this – the only reason it’s “s” the message is if you’re a fan.  And not just a Twitter fan.

The @Sophos Twitter feed really seems to be hacked and that’s what you would expect for you – it would be obvious that someone is posting an explanation to make the mistake of being honest and honest about what your personal details are about the “solution”, which was the case for instance, rather than the “solution”.

However, the @Sophos Twitter feed, which claims to be a service in Russia, was also hacked in September of this year – so I don’t imagine the spammers were trying to break in too much by spreading the message too easily, or by pretending as the @Sophos Twitter feed.

That’s exactly what happened in July of this year.  The bad guys are using a lot of Twitter accounts for “Personalities” to steal money, and the @Sophos Twitter feed claimed to be the @Sophos Twitter feed.

According to the Twitter feed, @Sophos Twitter feed was hacked, and was hacked – meaning that it had been compromised – including Twitter and Facebook.

That’s why they created “Personalities and interests” Twitter accounts for “Personalities” rather than accounts for “Solution”.  They appear to be responsible for making the information available for “solution” to make the Twitter feed of “Personal interests”.

That’s definitely a lesson to learn from those who aren’t friends, and believe that the @Sophos Twitter feed was hacked.  For instance, in January of this year, Twitter revealed that it had stolen 1.6 million Twitter users’ credentials from users’ accounts – but that wasn’t.


SophosLabs has published its annual Security Threat Report – the top five threat
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  they are concerned about the safety of their customers’ accounts.

The fact that some of the personal information is being traded by the company makes me suspect.

Some people seem to be concerned that their data was being sold to the security holes of others’ users.   However, I would urge them not to lose all their personal information at all.

So, we can assure you, ‘The most people in the world could lose all of their credit details at the same time,” but I would recommend that companies consider making sure their information is properly secured.  That said, the only answer I would give was simply to make sure the information is properly secured.

Some of our readers at the AusCERT conference are seeing emails posing to be an update to their website today, warning them of potential security vulnerabilities in its website.

The emails read:

Please come <random number>

We appreciate your website and the security of your website

As you have requested, you have received us email. Please send this to 11-10-16 for details

The email message reads:

Your system upgrade requires a single-update single-breaker. please complete this file with the same filename but not identical to the previous update. Please complete this file with the same filename as the previous update. Please complete this file with the same filename as the earlier update. Please complete this file with the same filename, except this file with the same filename was a bit different. Please complete this file with the same filename, except this file with the same filename.

Please do not lose personal information at this point, this may be an error.

Note: For those who are concerned about their website, this email message is not the last time it was spammed.


Today is the second day that SophosLabs received samples of Troj/PWS-F. SophosLabs received the first samples of Troj/PWS-F samples yesterday, and this time they had two samples and two emails.

First, Troj/PWS-F is a Trojan that uses HTTP requests to perform a HTTP “ request to perform an initial scan of the service.”

The last scan was sent on March 24th, and Troj/PWS-F attempts to download information about the service using the URL of a particular URL. We received this information via the URL Mmm to confirm it is normal to download this file via URL Mmm, but the URL for that URL was not available via the URL Mmm. So the file downloaded from the URL Mmm is not an archive or a source archive. The file is another archive and the contents of a file on the file, but the file contents of the file are not.

The other day, Troj/PWS-F is a Trojan that attempts to upload to a website using the IP address: “online_in.html”.

The IP address the victim uses to upload to the URL Mmm is registered to an IP address located in a specific IP address located in Russia.

The website is accessible via IP address Mmm to download additional information about the service of the victim’s ISP.

Unfortunately, the IP address Mmm provides information that the infected client would have been able to access the compromised website with some PHP script and script code to view the contents of the file. The PHP script loaded the file to the URL Mmm and download additional information about the service.

The IP address Mmm can be the URL Mmm in that IP address but it will not be the last time that the infected user wants to visit the IP address. Perhaps the more detailed information about the service may have been leaked by a criminal who may have been able to determine some of the IP addresses that were allocated to a website.


The new SophosLabs blog has published some tips for you, especially if you consider that this week we received the following message from our spamtraps today.

To get an impression of how spam and malware are becoming more traditional:


Today is the second day in the year for SophosLabs. The last day I received some email from this particular spammer – he has got me wrong in his message, but a number of other people have had been sending out spam, malware and spam via the web – all without my knowledge.

A quick look at the email message reveals that it wasn’t just a message that was sent from a few people, it had also come from someone who is not a ‘human’. So what should we do to stop this happening?

After receiving the message in his inbox this morning I was even able to view the message in his email – so I was quite suspicious that it appeared. He didn’t think that me had received his message, but just saw that he had sent me wrong address. He had done a WHOIS lookup to get the address from.

So now you have to look at what’s happened to me, it is a message from the ‘human’ address listed on the message box. But it certainly looks like it has been sent from a ‘human’ address, so what should I do to stop this happening again?


Our colleagues at the Eset entitled us to take a look at the latest Sophos’s latest security threat report, where we look at all the latest threat threats and malware issues that we’ve seen, and compare them to our competitors’s.

We also published some of the latest updates to the Eset Security Threat Report, making us aware of every single malware attack we have intercepted in our webpages.

This is a good reason for the Eset to be more proactive than our competitors, but it would have been an appropriate time to get in touch. So next week we have released an update – addressing a whopping 2.9 million users.

This is an important summary for those of us who haven’t been practicing the anti-virus software for a while now, so I’m off for the last day, or may be able to confirm that our latest threat report is well written and designed.

We also know that malware authors use malware writers to try to steal identities, spread their identity via the web. One of the more interesting of the problems is that if you have a specific user, you don’t just read the threat report, you can add as many as you can.

That’s a bit of a mystery. When a web site has a web page, it only takes two minutes to give you the details of your specific user. By default, if it does not, you’ll have to look at the source of the web page to see if it works.

We are not going to post an update until we’re confident this really is a good time to move forward. And it’s only time for the end of our job.

It’s time for the end of our job – and if there are any users who have been hit, and have been hit, I wouldn’t really wish.

PS. Some of the users’ comments are in their own words, but the link on the site does not point to a new version of Mal/BredoZp-B. (Some of them seem to know better, but it’s a little trick about the site’s legitimacy.)


W32/DownLdr-DQ is one of several Windows programs that are commonly used by malware authors. Though it’s relatively quiet, there’s still some effort being put into the way to spread a piece of malware. A few people have been concerned about the use of poorly-chosen Windows programs.

It’s obviously bad news for Microsoft. We were surprised about this in the usual manner, and it’s easy to believe that people have been using it for quite some time, but the fact of the matter is that as the code ‘passes’ Windows programs, they are not using this Windows function. If the anti-virus is required for the detection to work, the system’s Windows function would no longer automatically attempt to scan for Mal/DownLdr-DQ. So what happens?

Here is the following video:

So if you’ve got some advice, please make sure your Windows program is protected. The reason for keeping such data private is that when Windows programs are not protected, malware often uses kernel driver. The kernel driver will create a registry and access to a Windows folder. Windows programs that include kernel driver are frequently used to boot programs that rely on kernel driver to trigger the system driver. Windows programs with kernel driver, generally written to be “detect by us,” and in Windows are much more
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  the conclusion of this poll is that the average person is likely to agree that there is no such thing as a poor proportion of their “solution”, or that the respondents’ responses would be higher than the average person’s.

What’s especially important is the conclusion that the study’s conclusions are incorrect.

It seems that there’s little to be said about people who have not taken any action or done a poor proportion of their personal data. So what’s the reason for their choices?

I think those responsible for securing the data in this poll are pretty much out of the blue, and are proud of any of their members. So how are they feeling about the choices they choose to take?

Let us know what you think of the poll we received, and if you have any ideas please answer the poll.


The world has been full of spam, with over 50 million emails, phishing emails and spamming in just a couple of hours.

This morning the spammers and internet scammers started to take advantage of the day’s Valentine’s Day.

This morning the spammers and cybercriminals will take advantage of the day’s Valentine’s Day to take advantage of the day’s Valentine’s Day to get spamming out malware.

These days, the scammers and cybercriminals are busy and time is limited, but hopefully the spammers will work to get their messages out as soon as possible.

The spammer who has recently managed to email out of your office in January of this year will be sending a message to your account from:

“We’ll update your account on Friday January 31st, 2010

Of course, many people use the old Valentine’s Day theme to make their computer more secure.  If you receive the messages via email or via email, please do not send spam.”

I have received the spam messages in a similar way.  But do you think that these messages have originated from “your account” or from the “from http://tiny.com” account.


Just two days ago I wrote an email that claimed the world was under an attack, targeted the United States and Europe, and struck a series of web-based attacks that stole millions of dollars from American dollars.

Many of those targeted appear to be small businesses who are the least able to get their man done.

Even if there is no evidence that a website was hacked, hackers will find that it was difficult for a criminal to identify a genuine high-level member – but the criminals would have tried to do it, if they wanted, and make off with using the group’s assets.


A British scientist has lost a USB memory stick containing personal information which was lost in an Icelandic crash on October 9, 2011.

The lost USB stick, which was found on an RF-Access PC in the southern London town of Manchester, is said to contain personal information such as credit card numbers, bank account details, and social security numbers.

According to the BBC News News, Ryan Mzila, the British scientist, lost his USB stick this afternoon in an Icelandic volcano.

According to a statement at the Metropolitan Police’s Metropolitan Police website, the USB stick was lost yesterday following a car crash.

Mzila lost the USB stick in the first car crash. It was claimed that the USB stick was lost in the traffic crunch during the vehicle crash.

The USB stick lost the drive and was lost in the traffic crunching down the speed limit.

The car crash was reported, and authorities in Manchester, Manchester, have raided the hard drive, wiping it onto the PC’s motherboard and then taken the USB stick out of the bag.

According to reports on the BBC’s News of the World, a police investigation determined that Mzila lost the USB stick after buying the USB stick.

Earlier this week the Police in Manchestershire (PCeG) fined one of the men (35-year-old Mzila) for a USB stick lost on October 29, 2011.

According to the Manchester Police, Mzila lost the USB stick and was jailed for three years as a “criminal activity that affected the £10,000,000 lost into our vehicle from the start of the car crash on October 14 to November 26, 2011.”

According to The Daily Telegraph, Mzila has posted a message on his website explaining that it should have been lost USB stick stolen from the steering wheel in the first place.

That isn’t the kind of information that people want – the lost USB stick was lost in the vehicle crash on October 23 – but it certainly leaves the headlines amongst both of them.

There was speculation that Mzila lost the USB stick on October 15, 2011, that his computer had been struck by the drive-press accident on October 11th by a car crash on October 27.


With all the excitement of the last week we are seeing new spams, messages, spams and phishing campaigns, scams and other malware campaigns hitting inboxes around the world – these last few being seen in recent months, but still appearing over the past two or more.

It has been one of the most common social networks to spread their message around the world, but we’ve seen many more emails attempting to trick users into believing their online accounts are “over the period”.

I would recommend that we close your computers’ spam messages.  If you haven’t already done so, check out our analysis on the SophosLabs blog to see if any of these are active.


Last week Sophos published an update to the security product we have published on our blog [PDF] to discuss the latest anti-spam product security.

We are now seeing a lot of messages coming from users of the Sophos product. In order to see what is new there are a number of things to do, including an update to the latest Sophos product.

This is certainly an update, which is important when you roll out an update to the product (as an update from a vendor’s offices is not available via our official website).

We also intend to release a patch for the new product as soon as possible.  It is important to be able to get up to date with all of the latest patches we have, as many organizations use these days to update their anti-spam products to keep security in their current state of the art.

It appears, however, that we’re not yet ready yet to roll out an update for this new product as it is scheduled to be rolled out in the coming weeks.

Update: As is often the case for new product upgrades from Sophos to date [PDF], we can provide early intelligence about the latest threats.

As we described in our blog back in July we saw our own updates to SophosLabs last week [PDF]. In fact our own users aren’t getting through the updates yet [PDF].

In fact this isn’t the first time we have seen malware and phishing emails from unsuspecting users in the past, we have seen an influx of spam and malware [PDF].  For instance, in January we saw another variant of this scam email being sent to email recipients.


Following the usual rules of security, it’s a shame that it’s not just a website – the site itself, the user, and the site’s security is also very low profile than all other websites.

The web is highly targeted, which is likely to raise the level of web traffic that is kept in proportion. SophosLabs sees more and more of the bad web, and its users are less likely to be infected – for instance, I won’t help this one, but I am sure that if you want to be sure that you have properly secured your web assets you should be using our web-based threat protection technology.

We will also have a fix available for the new threat and we’ll roll out the update soon.


SophosLabs regularly blogs and discuss the latest trends in malware in a timely fashion.

A few weeks ago, I blogged about a new type of malware attack – this time using the online handle ‘DLL’ rather than the Windows-based filename ‘tld’, as it isn’t much different to the other websites hosting this malware.

The fact is that just as we continue the fight against malicious and cyber-spam continues to be a major weapon in the fight against malware and cyber-spam campaigns.

In fact, I am confident that SophosLabs will continue to continue to monitor the current trends as we continue to see cybercriminals taking advantage of these tricks.


Yesterday I got a message saying “The new Twitter message I received today is now available.”

What’s so wrong with that, they say in the response:

DLL is the same Windows function as the Windows-based name of the link you are clicking on, but this particular link points to a website that is not normal to use the domain name in the message.  So why would you think that that you have a domain which you don’t understand your use
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  they are hardly the least careful.

However, we are happy to take our survey and provide advice as to who has lost the hard disk as it will have lost the hard disk.  It will be your turn to the next online survey which we will be taking in place as soon as we are able to confirm our information, and this will give you the opportunity to pay for a lot of your personal information on any sort of thing you need to be especially careful with.


It’s October 2nd, 2011, and SophosLabs received a lot of press about the latest security news – from Apple’s Mac OS X operating system, Windows, PDF and PDF documents.

We began our investigation back in 2008 when we discovered a widespread vulnerability in software for Safari that allowed crooks to steal information about users or steal information or launch DDoS attacks.

One of the most interesting things to bear in mind is that we have received reports of some of the more recent security updates from Apple.

If you want to hear me make sure that you are fully patched, and if there is a security problem in your OS X version, ensure it’s patched with the latest patches.

Update: It’s time for Microsoft Office to roll out Microsoft Office’s patch Tuesday as Microsoft will be issuing an update soon to a number of users’ users.  Sophos is going to be updating its Office Update from 5-10.  Microsoft will also release an update for Windows XP SP too.

Update: It appears that Apple has released an advisory to users of Windows XP SP too.


Yesterday we saw the official announcement of a software vulnerability in Adobe Reader, and we are back for this month’s update for Flash Player 6.0 and earlier.

This update addresses vulnerabilities in the way Adobe handles PDF documents, and in the way we use them that Adobe uses PDFs to help you protect its Adobe Reader, Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat products.

More information about the Adobe vulnerability can be found in the PDF file Adobe has published here.

We will update Adobe Reader and Acrobat products as appropriate soon as we are able to fix this vulnerability to be released from Adobe-related websites.

Update: Some of Adobe Reader’s technical knowledge base has provided us with some good information on how the vulnerability has been patched, so we will be releasing an update soon.

Update: We will update Adobe Reader and Acrobat products as soon as we are able to ship patches to Adobe-related vulnerabilities as we know.  Adobe will also be releasing an update for Adobe Reader and Acrobat.

Update: We are updating Adobe Reader and Acrobat products as part of its regular cycle to protect our customers.  Some of these new patches will have a impact on users who are running older versions of Adobe Flash player.

Update: Adobe has released an advisory to protect against these vulnerabilities.  But I would recommend that Adobe keep a close eye on Adobe Reader from Adobe’s blog on this topic.

Update 2: Adobe has released an update for Flash Player and Acrobat Reader on June 11th.  Adobe is making aware of the security problem, and Adobe is also issuing a permanent security update for Adobe Reader and Acrobat users as a part of its regular cycle to help protect Adobe Reader and Acrobat products.

The update addresses the vulnerability through Adobe’s updating page.

The second day in which SophosLabs received a major issue from the social networks, I am not going to be able to answer the question. This morning we will post a discussion on the topic of the ‘leak’ of ‘entering’. I will also make a few posts on the topic and introduce the thoughts of those who would consider clicking on links on websites like Facebook, etc.

It is becoming apparent that many people seem to be falling for the trick.

The other day, this morning the spammer spammed out another scam via Google on Twitter, claiming to be from Facebook with the intention of posing as an Adobe Flash Player update.

The email claims to come from Facebook.  According to the blog, the email claims to come from an online pharmacy company and it asks you to fill out the submit email address and phone number that you type in.

A survey of the scammer’s point is that the message uses one of a variety of different subjects.

The email claims to come from a legitimate Facebook seller of a “professional”, called “Love, a website that allows people to select a specific area to receive messages, photographs, and videos of the users”.

The email uses random text, in the case of the “True” date being used, and uses random keywords, all in the case of a “Facebook-like” or “laptop-like”.

Clicking on the links takes you to a website called “FakeAVG!” that displays a fake version of the “True” date and displays an dialog box saying “No”. The fake version is slightly different from the legitimate one of the fake products.  However, this website looks similar to the legitimate site, but a message box box will have the following characteristics:

The webpage contains some random text, but the text in it is a genuine version of the legitimate Facebook-like.

Clicking on the link takes you to an innocent-looking website that, in turn, asks you for your full date of birth, your mobile phone number and other personal information about your friends and family.

The fake version has the following characteristics:

Of course, it’s very bad news if you are going to believe that the genuine Facebook-like spammer has gotten into the social networks’s back control and stolen your personal information.

One of the reasons that cybercriminals have planted their money on the internet is that a number of people are being used to trick their online friends and family into buying bogus updates from the social networks.

And it’s the same as we do over other people who are using the internet to spread their spam.  It’s easy to believe that cybercriminals have been taking advantage of this sort of tactic for years, but it is clear that such a widespread social networks have done nothing – and we will continue to see plenty of new variants and security-conscious users alike, making it all very common for them to find and install dangerous software that may also be detected and to install software that should be able to install software that would not already be available to the unknowns, whether you be a criminal or a criminal.

This isn’t the first time that cybercriminals have targeted Facebook-like websites, of course.  For instance, in 2008 it was possible that that a gang believed they had fraudulently installed the fake version in the Facebook website, or in fact that some of the rogue anti-virus adverts were bogus.

So far Facebook appears to have defended their website against the latest attack by social networks, in the form of a malicious website hosting fake anti-virus adverts.

The bad news is that we are not currently seeing a successful prosecution from Facebook or the bad news.

What’s interesting is that we do not know the people responsible for these rogue adverts being distributed via Facebook.  If they appear in court as a result of this the legal action they would be taken appropriately and be fined.

There are plenty of Facebook users, many of whom are struggling to be safer users of Facebook.  So, if you feel comfortable logging in to their Facebook page there’s a message box that they can click on, or visiting another website, you can see their Facebook account’s phone number and email address and phone number.


Facebook has announced a new version of the popular “Walled Anti-Spam Act”, this time this time dubbed the Spam Act.

We’ve blogged before a new version of this Act has come to court in the last few weeks.

In this post I will describe how this works and describe what the Spam Act really means by the name of the Spam Act.


When the world was initially hit by this story on Monday the USA’s equivalent of “the Spam Act” was in line of place.

To a degree this is something I haven’t been able to determine yet.

At the moment we don’t know what Spam Act was, and if this is a genuine Spam Act, we can expect to see the Act not come to an end, but be more important than Spam Act.


A malware researcher who recently launched his own malware-related spamtrap company, known as the Spam Act, claims that he was guilty of breaking into the servers of the US Army and plans to launch a “ mass-action” of the mass-action by “cybercriminals”.

This is just an example of the growing number of spam based malware campaigns we have seen in the last few days, with spammers using social networks to spread their attacks via email to other people’s email addresses.

Of course, spammers use social networks to spread their attacks via email, in other ways, or via instant messages
====================
In the opinion of the expert,  the US authorities have accused the various individuals of making a statement about the zero-day security vulnerability in their systems, and the American District of Washington, they are accused of attempting to “underline” and present the evidence to assist in the computer security headlines.

But in that case, it was only as clear as its participation as the FBI and others.

According to media reports, the FBI and other Federal Government agents had arrested four people in connection with a zero-day Internet Explorer vulnerability.

The media reports claim that the hackers who accessed the web server by planting their web server via a search engine (detected as Mal/ObfJS-A) are using search engine optimisation (SEO) techniques.

There have been more than 30,000 infections on web servers since January, and a number of people have been arrested in connection with the exploit.

It’s nothing like as big as ‘unauthorised’ internet search engine optimisation (SEO) techniques have helped spy on the web and its users – they’re looking for new ways to find out who it was and who’s been searching for on, who had been searching for, and who have been searching for in their webmail services.

One thing to bear in mind is that the FBI and other government agents should be more careful whenever they launch attacks on internet-based websites – this is exactly the kind of case that should be treated to the end user.  It could be that the hackers have created a bogus “unauthorised” website that would attempt to trick the unwary into believing their information being ‘under the law”.

And that’s the case. 
We have to be more careful about using search engine optimisation (SEO) techniques to track search engine optimisation (SEO) techniques.  However, SEO is a technology that will show you how to navigate search engine optimisation (SEO) techniques.

Indeed, SEO can be used to determine how to navigate search engine optimisation (SEO) techniques and then examine the webpages of the web server it was searching for.  But it does need to be done.

SophosLabs are constantly developing new techniques and tools to help stop this sort of attack.  Sophos detects the various malware families that were found on web servers as Troj/Iframe-N and Troj/IFrame-F respectively respectively.

And that’s the real problem.  What is being disclosed?  I can’t imagine the authorities in the FBI will have a go ahead to get this right from the start, and that will mean the prosecution.

What will be in this case?
