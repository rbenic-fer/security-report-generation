In large countries, the growing popularity of this type of material was cause to research. The results of this data are locations
provSection consuming. Nevertheless, research on mobile devices under the Cybercrime@IPA
project. Some are professionally scoped and heavily invested in and others may be one officer with a
computer and freely available forensic tools. Anyone who contemplates setting up and relying on a
digital forensic laboratory should carefully research the requirements of their jurisdiction, ensuring
they consult with the other players in the criminal justice system of the country.
The responsible prosecutor, and to a certain extent forensic managers and staff, must be
aware not only of the applicable criminal law framework, but very often about laws and
by-laws which are regulating telecommunications, service provider operations, information
technology, as well as international law related to substantive criminal law, procedural law
and mutual legal assistance. For example, grounds for the retention of data and rules for
their acquisition for criminal investigation purposes are often stipulated by laws or acts on
electronic communications.

Processing of computer systems

During processing the forensic examiners may prioritise certain devices or data and will produce an
exact copy or image of the content of any digital storage seized. Working on media files such as
the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connectionalgorithm, data may be acquired where not be stored.
3.3.1.2 Triaging techniques
In cases where involve lots of computer systems and storage media it might not be possible for the
digital forensics lab to analyses each and every exhibit within a reasonable amount of time. That is
when a triaging technique could help. It can also be one model used in the digital forensic process
to find out quickly which computer seems most promising to analyse.
Triage in the digital forensics context is the process by which cases or activities are prioritised to
determine which case, which exhibit and which type to data are to be examined firstly, secondly,
etc. This process can include the possibility that some exhibits or data are not examined at all
(exclusive triage) or that some data will just be analysed at a later stage (prioritising triage).
Triage considers the value of investigating, the complexity, the cost and the order in which the
investigation should be accomplished.
While triaging offers some advantages there are also disadvantages that need to be addressed. A
triage cannot replace a full examination. That is why triage should not be used on a daily basis.
Using only automated techniques to retrieve evidence and/or only examining a small sub-set of all
data comes with the risk to miss evidence. Those disadvantages need to be explained to the
investigator, prosecutor or judge and based on that information they need to decide in favour or
against the triaging process for that particular case.

Digital Forensics Guide

However, triage remains a valid method in order to cope with a situation that could not be solved
in any other way. Examples for such situations include:


a huge amount of exhibits to no evidential value. This pertains not only to the files
data that no matter what level of support is available (for information
regarding the different levels of support, see chapter 3.3.1.2.6).

While triaging offers some advantages there are also disadvantages to consider when
developing their new chunk of evidence against the more harrowing investigations.
Triage in the digital forensics context is the process by which cases or activities are prioritised to
determine which case, which exhibit and which type to data are to be examined firstly, secondly,
etc. This process can include the possibility that some exhibits or data are not examined at all
(exclusive triage) or that some software notepad software solutions.

File Timings Explained
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when an item required researching
(called MAC times). Some like many UNIX flavours (inc Linux) apply stamps
time stamps on all activity (unless prohibited by the tool accessing the file).
Microsoft Windows however, will stamp full time and date information on

creation and modification but only date information on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, access it on the 2nd Nov, modify it on the 3rd Nov and copy it
onto separate media on the 4th; when the MACs are viewed on the 5th
however, it will appear to have been accessed and modified before it was
created.

ins

fu
ll r

igh
ts.

As will be explained in the section 3. file, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained the MAC times of the original carried files. Thus
when the carried files are exported from the carrier file a new instance is
written to the new media and although this will have a different creation time
again, it will retain the original accessed and modification times.

Appendix A – Comparison of forensic software
All appendices in section A are templates and should aid laboratory managers to develop their own comparison matrix in order to make an educated decision about software, hardware
and training purchases. In some tables, exemplary data are provided for better understanding. It is important to understand that each forensic laboratory might have its’ own
prerequisites, demands and maybe even legal framework (e.g. mandatory list of court-validated software). While one lab might have a majority of cases involving recovery of files and
filesystems another lab might only have cases where large amounts of documents and e-mails might need to be analysed. While the first laboratory might choose one particular forensic
software that suits their requirements (excellent data carving, file system support and recovery capabilities) the other laboratory might aim for another solution that fits their demands
better. There cannot be one definite recommendation for a specific software that is the universal best solution for all digital forensic laboratories.

Please remember that results from each individual software should be double-checked. The ideal situation is that the results are double-checked by manually analysing the raw data.
Depending on the data and on the knowledge of the examiner this might not be possible in any case. In this case the results of the first tool should be checked against the results of a
second tool. Some legislations even require dual-tool verification legally. Thus, it is good practise to have more than one forensic software available at a forensic lab in order to crosscheck the results.

A.1) Available software for digital forensics laboratories
A variety of different software is needed in order to run a digital forensics laboratory. This includes case management software as well as feature-packed suites for computer and mobile forensics.
Depending on the tasks of the laboratory additional specialised software may be required. The number of forensic big and small software solutions is huge and very agile. Especially the open
source community is publishing new tools nearly every day. It is not the aim of this guide to provide a full list of all available tools. However, to provide a better overview that can assist in the
development of a comparison matrix a list of useful resources is given below.
