Recruitment should start as soon as the business case has been accepted and the premises are
identified. Having key staff on hand to assist with the identification and selection of hardware and
software would be beneficial. It may be that these key staff are already trained or are familiar with
a certain type of forensic software and would rather work with this. Ideally the roles and
responsibilities of each vacancy will be established prior to advertising.
Once staff are recruited to use the identification and verify their security vetting material they will be secured.
Digital forensics analysts should ensure that they are fully conversant with the laws of their own countries related to the digital forensic
 process and be in place to explain their procedures and findings in detail; their statements will be
examined both by the prosecution and defence, and, depending on the system, by the
judiciary. This situation can be of crucial importance for the success or failure of the
case and it must be taken seriously.

Prosecutors should be aware that given the equality of arms the defence will be able to rely on it as the truth.
Content that the equality of arms the defence will be likely to engage expert witnesses of their own, who will
challenge most, if not all, aspects of the expert examination. This kind of situation is
becoming more and more frequent in courtrooms and forensic experts must be prepared
for this.
Alternative presentation methods are depending on the technical facilities of the court but
not only there. Plea bargaining and, in some countries, the growing popularity of
“deferred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many

Steganographic Program that hides user selected data inside carrier files. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
attention. For example, you could create a picture file that looks and

behaves exactly like any other picture file but contains hidden encrypted
files, or you could hide a file inside a Word document that would not attract
attention if discovered. Such files can later be safely extracted. For additional
security you can password your camouflaged file. This password will be
required when extracting the files within. You can even camouflage files
within camouflaged files. Camouflage was written for use with Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT and Windows 2000, and is simple
to install and use.”

An attempt to recreate the image made by Mr R J Leszczynski failed in that the md5
hashes of the output file are not the same. That said it is unlikely that they would as
the files would be different given the different MAC times that would accompany the

the imaged drives (having performed a deep or recursive hash of all files on
his HDD; this will confirm or otherwise the presence of pre or post
camouflaged files.
2.
Prevent Mr R J Leszczynski from having any access to his or any
Company system, all of his accounts should be frozen immediately and any
current sessions terminated immediately; in case he tries to destroy
evidence.

The only points that jump out from the above list are that the investigator hopes the
user didn’t use this system for online banking with Lloydstsb as several of the
Spyware and Trojans installed were capable of keystroke logging. And it is a
shame they didn’t stop longer at the Zonelabs site, even the free personal firewall
would have been useful.

This did present a problem as to this point no passwords had been recovered, either
in text files on in the form of an obvious file or text in a file on the disk.

Passwords
The investigator then tried a few default passwords, starting with “password” which
was rejected. The next one tried was “Password” this was the correct password as
the image below shows the contents of the Camouflaged file.

The “Password” was then tried on the other potential carrier file but it was not
accepted. At this point the investigator was slightly stumped and began to examine
the strings file for the FD to glean any possible password. After some time and
after trying several dozen passwords gold was struck. It closer examination
indicated that the password for the Password_Policy.doc file was the first part of
the file name, thus “Remote” was tried on the Remote_Access_Policy.doc file
and the following files were revealed to inside the carrier.
