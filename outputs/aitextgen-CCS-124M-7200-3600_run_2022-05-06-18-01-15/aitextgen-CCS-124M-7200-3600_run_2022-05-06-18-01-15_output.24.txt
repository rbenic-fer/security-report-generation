Using only automated techniques to retrieve evidence and/or only examining a small sub-set of all
data comes with the risk to miss evidence. Those disadvantages need to be explained to the
investigator, prosecutor or judge and based on that information they need to decide in favour or
against the triaging process for that particular case.

Digital Forensics Guide

However, triage remains a valid method in order to cope with a situation that could not be solved
in any other way. Examples for such situations include:


a huge amount of exhibits to no evidential value



exhibits cannot be stored any longer because of legal issues



getting information as quickly as possible is of highest priority (e.g. in terrorist cases)

A triaging offers some advantages there are also disadvantages to analyze:

3.2.1.6 Physical vs. logical copy
There are two types of copies; a physical and a logical one. While a physical copy includes all raw
data a logical copy typically not every case is preferred to a physical copy of all that data. On disk level for
example a physical copy includes the whole disk including the partitioning scheme, all partitions
and even unallocated areas while a logical copy on disk level is just a copy of one logical
partition.
33

Digital Forensics Guide

A digital forensic analyst should typically not only find traces of value to the digital forensic analyst. That is why it is important to verify that all forensic
copies of the evidence are double-checked by manually analysing the raw data.
Depending on the data and on the knowledge of the examiner this might not be possible in any case. In this case the forensic analyst
can even find situations where not a single byte of data can be retrieved
from a company’s computers because they will merely be client computers without any storage
media of their own, but using the resources of a virtual machine in the cloud. The advantage with
this is that, technically, the virtual machine can be easily copied. Depending on the relevant and
applicable legislation, however, identifying and obtaining the appropriate legal authorisation for
intercepting such data might be a problem. It may also be challenging to ensure that data have
been acquired in compliance with the legal procedures in the requesting country.
Another disadvantage is to make that data have to be acquired in compliance with the legal procedures in the requesting country.
Another disadvantage is to make there are likely to be far less recoverable data available to find.
Indeed if a suspect were to create a temporary virtual machine for committing his or her crimes
and then to delete that machine, there might be no evidence at all to recover.
50

Digital Forensics Guide

The possibility to acquire and analyse data that is remotely stored is highly depending on the
legislation and jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions for example the forensic analyst - under certain
circumstances - is allowed to connect to the remote storage using the suspect's credentials from
the computer in order to acquire the data from the cloud provider. Other jurisdictions will not
accept such an acquisition. In those cases the official channels can be used in order to request
preservation and access to the data from the provider.
3.4.1.2.11 Computer Memory (RAM)

When computer memory has been acquired while the seized computer was still running (as
described in chapter 3.5 of the Electronic Evidence Guide), the memory dump can be analysed in
the forensics laboratory.

Abstract
This document is submitted as the practical part of the GCIA Certified Forensic
Analyst program (GCFA)1.

This practical is in two parts, the first of which required an image of a floppy disk properties despite being
connected to a home use one ; additionally the laboratories operating system.
The conclusion being that the owner and holder of the disk had
attempted to export company data via this hidden means.

The second part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user).

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The “Comscene Publications Act 1959 & 1964” criminal justice systems still exists,
but the borderline is becoming less visible and hybrid systems emerge as time goes by
and practitioners all over the world are demanding more unified and, above all, more
expedited systems for criminal justice.
The position and role of prosecutors in a contemporary criminal justice system becomes
more prominent. In most systems prosecutors are bridging points between suppression
and litigation, between discovery and adjudication of criminal acts, and between the
police and other law enforcement agencies as well as judges and courts.
Taking that into account, processes and procedures in the forensics laboratory may or be dismissed.
The responsible prosecutor, and to a certain extent forensic managers and staff, must be
aware not only of the applicable criminal law framework, but very often about laws and
by-laws which are regulating telecommunications, service provider operations, information
technology, as well as international law related to substantive criminal law, procedural law
and mutual legal assistance. For example, grounds for the retention of data and rules for
their acquisition for criminal investigation purposes are often stipulated by laws or acts on
electronic communications.

Processing stage

During processing the forensic examiners may prioritise certain devices or data and will produce an
exact copy or image of the content of any digital storage seized. Working on the duplicate (never
the original) they can apply smart, case-specific filters (data mining) or they can just process the
image (e.g. by recovering deleted files, mounting containers, breaking encryption, parsing
application data like internet history, chat logs, etc.). Those processing steps are often times
repeatable for specific categories of cases. Even though they are resource intensive needing a lot of
computing power and time they can typically be run over-night, over the weekend or on a second
forensic workstation that is not in use.

3.3.1

Processing of computer systems

Not only the number of computer systems per household and organisations, but also the amount of
storage in these computer systems is rising. Managing large amount of data while keeping the
backlog short is a big challenge for digital forensics laboratories. That is why different processing
approaching should be considered.
3.3.1.1 Exhibit Handling
Forensic officers must use extra care when handling computer systems, as they contain batteries and
can easily be powered on accidentally. This is likely to change evidential data in the process, such
as time and date information for last use. Experts should pay special attention during initial
handling to identify power buttons and to provide network isolation at all times.
The ‘Isolation’ phase is essential, as many cases will contain distressing pictures,
videos and text depicting child abuse, sexual abuse or terrorism subject matter. In some cases the
quantity of this type of material will cause stress; occasionally the depravity depicted in the digital
images will affect the analyst more. It is important that the digital
forensics analyst does not state something in the report that he cannot prove, e.g. "The suspect
has done A, B, C"; it is only possible to state "With this computer, at this point of time, using user
account XY, file A has been created, USB thumb drive B has been attached and in inbox of webmail
account C has been visited."
A digital forensics report should consist of the following main chapters:
1.

Information about the request and the mandate

2.

Information about the exhibits

3.

Information about the examination methods (persons/software/hardware)

4.

Acquisition process

5.

Analysis process

6.

Result

An exemplary layout of a report has been attached to this document in appendix J.
In the digital forensics laboratory it should be clearly defined who is responsible for the report and
who will be delivering the evidence in court. Typically the basis of the report is February 15, SHA
