The file (written by the GIAC
of certified professionals) was then placed in the Lab Internal folder (http://www.pjc.com/spyware-doctor). The final step for this
item was to create the time-line file from the body with a start and end point. As
Floppy disk contained small amounts of data a complete timeline was requested
and this was saved as ‘output/total-timeline’.

The last modified date and time stamps shows that all three of the groups of evidence are backdated. The
file date stamps show that they are consistent with the numeric dates reflected in the
video file names as well as the folders in the path of those video files. Furthermore, the date stamps embedded within
the videos themselves are consistent with the date stamps of the folders in the video file path.
The example of the relationship between the video file name and file created date stamps shows that they are consistent with the numeric dates reflected in the

3.2.1 Exhibit Handling
Forensic officers must use extra care when handling mobile devices, as they contain batteries and
can easily be powered on accidentally. This is likely to change evidential data in the process, such
as time and date information for last use. Experts should pay special attention during initial
handling to identify power buttons and to provide network isolation at all times.
The ‘Isolation’ phase is essential, as many devices require acquisitions to be conducted when it is
‘Live.’ This means that the examiner will be required to power the device on in order to use the
device functioning throughout the acquisition. If the mobile device is not isolated and allowed to
connect to external networks, such as the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connection, data may be changed on the device. One example is that it is possible to remotely wipe
some mobile devices.
Isolation can be achieved through different forms:


Production of a ‘Laboratory SIM/IDEN card’ – a SIM/IDEN card that appears to the
device as the original SIM/IDEN card but lacks the capability to actually connect to the
mobile network. A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) / Integrated Digital Enhanced
Network (IDEN) identifies the subscriber to the network which the mobile device wishes to
connect to



Acquisition in a network shielded room – a dedicated laboratory with Faraday
shielding installed to prevent network isolation.



Use of wireless jamming equipment – equipment can be acquired that can jam and
prevent wireless signals from reaching the exhibit. These devices are illegal in some
36

Digital Forensics Guide

jurisdictions.
The best method will depend on local laws, laboratory set up and on the device being examined.
Consideration should also be applied to prevent connection to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals.
Before proceeding with acquiring the mobile device exhibit, it must be identified. The device will
often have an equipment label affixed to the inside of the handset, if it is a mobile telephone, or
printed on the back of the device. The label will include an International Mobile Equipment Identify
Number (IMEI), a Mobile Equipment Identity Number (MEID) or Serial Number. This data can be
used to uniquely identify the devices and is important for requesting billing records or conducting
cell site analysis later. The make, model and IMEI/MEID can then be used to look up the device
using your forensic packages to determine what level of support is available (for information
regarding the different levels of support, see chapter 3.2.2.6).
Also at this stage, a review of the case paperwork supplied with the exhibit from the officer in
charge should be undertaken to ascertain what evidence is required from the device. This can help
the examiner make a decision in regards to what level of examination should be undertaken, i.e. if
deleted data is required then a physical examination should be sort for. An attempt should also be
made to gather any known passcodes, passwords or patterns from the device’s owner prior to the
full examination. This will ensure that no matter what level of support is available for the device, at
least access can be granted to the data that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN cards or memory cards. This plan should include the acquisition of data from the SIM /
IDEN card(s) and memory card(s) (if applicable) and what level of exam is going to be undertaken
and why. The examiner should also plan a second level of exam in case the first level of exam is
not successful due to various difficulties, i.e. a broken or ineffective power button (see chapter
3.2.2.6 for levels of examination).
3.2.2.2 Wiping imaging media / sterilising / cross-contamination
When producing images of the mobile devices, it is considered best practice to use a clean target
medium, which does not contain any data relating to any previously examined exhibits. If using
laboratory or cloned SIM cards, examiners must ensure that the laboratory SIM card contains the
data from the last inserted SIM card.
3.2.2.3 Write blocking
Due to some specific extraction techniques, such as iOS Boot loader extractions and rooting of
Android

The only points that jump out from the above list are that the investigator hopes the
user didn’t use this system for online banking with Lloydstsb as several of the
Spyware and Trojans installed were capable of keystroke logging. And it is a
shame they didn’t stop longer at the Zonelabs site, even the free personal firewall
would have been useful.

A.2) Cost overview of standard software for forensic analysis
Remember: All costs for software, hardware and training are reoccurring expenses. While the initial purchase of a forensic software is usually a one-time cost the reoccurring costs for
annual license renewals should never be forgotten. Since the prices for license updates and service subscriptions may differ significantly depending on the product it is important to
pay attention to those costs. Besides that, hardware needs to be renewed on a regular basis in order to maximise the performance of the evidence processing and to meet the
requirements of updated forensic software. In addition to that even the training costs are reoccurring because digital forensics examiners need continuous professional education.
