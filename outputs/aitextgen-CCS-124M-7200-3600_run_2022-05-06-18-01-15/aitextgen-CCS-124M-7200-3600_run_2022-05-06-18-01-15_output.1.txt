The guidance for this group will be more involved in the capacity of the digital forensics arena. It is recognised that there is no single
solution applicable to all countries or even different organisations within countries. The guide is
designed to assist managers to make decisions about a subject with which many may not be
familiar.
The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of laboratory activities and the staff
that will carry out the function of acquisition, processing analysing and presenting electronic
evidence.

The guidance for this group will be more specific to the functions related to the capacity of the digital forensics arena. It is important
for digital forensics laboratories to have a control system to store backups.
As a laboratory staff mentoring process is very expensive
and the use of Faraday bags may be an alternative. As a last resort, completely enclosing the
devices in strong silver foil as a temporary measure will prevent communication with devices.
Forensic imaging department – The imaging department will require a large, clean surface area
preferably with raised edges to prevent the loss of screws and small components, whilst computers
are being dismantled for acquisition. Anti-static mats should be on all work surfaces. An area for
digital camera and battery chargers should be arranged, as all evidence should be photographed
prior to imaging. Each imager will require a desk area large enough to hold two monitors and two
computers, acquisition hardware, telephone and paperwork. A chair for each imager, preferably a
comfortable operator’s chair, with lumbar support and height adjustment should also be provided.
Analyst work station - The digital forensics analyst will require a large desk area big enough to
hold several monitors, two computers, various paperwork, mobile devices and mobile device
extraction hardware and tools. Again a comfortable chair would be beneficial due to the amount of
time spent sat at the monitor. It would also be advisable to position the desks to avoid others from

accidentally viewing sensitive data on the screens – or put privacy screens between the
workstations to provide a cubicle type environment.
Server room – The space allocated to central server will need to be secure due to the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room for resilience like UPS.

2.5.2

Software and hardware

Hardware - The digital forensic laboratory should be a high tech environment with lots of sensitive
data being analysed and stored. As such, it will require an examination network, which is isolated
from any external connections. As all laboratory staff will use this network it will need to be
resilient, secure and fast. When setting up any server or system, best practice would be to opt for
the highest available processing power and a suitable data storage array.
This system must provide Internet access to the team, either individually supplied to all hosts or
just to one dedicated computer within the laboratory. This should allow analysts and staff easy use
for checking emails, researching, downloading patches, updates and tools.
Any analyst would prefer that two monitors make their work easier. When it comes to building their
final reports it is much easier to have the report open on one screen and their investigation on the
other. It can also assist when viewing a high quantity of thumbnails. Whilst this is extra expense,
the benefits of having this viewing capability will provide time saving benefits along with a robust
system that can support the analysts provide more accurate reports for evidence.
Those responsible for imaging computers will require sanitised storage disks and write blockers to
prevent any changes in data and the integrity of the original evidence. There are numerous

The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of laboratory activities and the staff
that will carry out the function of acquisition, processing analysing and presenting electronic
evidence.
The guidance for this group will be more involved in the expertise processes, including involvement in particular
phases of the process itself. It is envisaged that this area would be less secure than the rest of the
laboratory so no case papers or sensitive paperwork should be stored in this area.
Secure property store – This facility should be large enough to store various items of computer
and mobile phone evidence for a significant period of time. Computers can come in all shapes and
sizes and some servers are very large and heavy. Conversely, mobile phones and external storage
devices could be easily damaged or lost if not stored securely. The property store should be a
secure room with access control. It should be situated close to reception and close to the Imaging
area to avoid the need to carry heavy items too far. Ideally you should install strong shelving and a
numbering system to segregate the exhibits to allow easy identification of exhibits for each case.
Consider purchasing plastic boxed to house the smaller exhibits. The exact location of the exhibits
for each case should be noted in the case management system and exhibits returned to the same
location once imaging has been concluded. It may also be worth considering isolating the secure
store from radio waves by implementing Faraday shielding. This will ensure the isolation of devices
with wireless communication capabilities. There have been reported instances of the contents of
mobile devices being remotely deleted while in police custody. A Faraday cage is very expensive
and the use of Faraday bags may be an alternative. As a last resort, completely enclosing the
devices in strong silver foil as a temporary measure will prevent communication with devices.

facts are returned to the same levels of protection as possible and
 strong enough to install strong shelving and a Faraday cage. It would therefore make sense to prepare for another solution for all digital forensic laboratories. The Faraday cage is to take responsibility to ensure the health and safety of all staff
that come into the ownership and management of their digital forensics
laboratory. It is good practice to not only have one backup but also another off-site backup.
While the digital forensic analyst is conducting the analysis with his working copy of the image
there should still be a backup stored on another system (e.g. an imaging server).

3.2.2

Acquisition of computer systems

As with computer-based examinations, the aim during the acquisition of a computer system is to
produce the best possible copy, or image, of data stored on the system.
The original forensic image shows that all forensic tools are available.
The basis of such a analysis is to either acquire all existing hardware and.
The forensic image of the laptop has been retained for future use and reference
should be required to ensure that the image is mounted write-protect with a write cache
allowing the virtual operating system to write log files and changes to that write cache without
affecting the integrity of the image. Some operating systems refuse to start in virtual
environments. This can typically be solved by replacing drivers and adapting configurations, using
software like OpenGates and OpenJobs. Should the virtual operating system start with a password
prompt the forensic analyst needs to either crack that password or blank it.
3.4.1.4 Process for handling mass data
Some cases involve lots of computer systems and storage media while the workload for the
forensic laboratories is already very high. A separation between forensic analysis and content
51

Digital Forensics Guide

analysis can spread the work more evenly between the digital forensics analysts and the case
investigators. The forensic analysts can concentrate on recovering, parsing, mounting and
processing of exhibits while the content analysis is being done by investigators with case
knowledge. A process needs to be in place and the software and overhanding techniques
supporting this process need to be in place (e.g. container file provided by forensic analyst to
investigator, viewer component to be used by investigator, handing back the finding to the forensic
analyst).
3.4.1.5 Visualisation aids
For aiding in visualisation of complex data structures, visualisation aids can be helpful. Examples
for those aids are:


Timelines: Indicating the behaviour of the user: When did the suspect log in, when did he
connect a certain medium, when did he connect to which wireless lan, when did he view
which website, etc.



Relationship diagrams: Can give answers to the questions: Who has met whom at which
point of time using which medium? Which information was sent/received? Who knows
whom? Who is the main suspect who coordinated the others?



Moneyflow diagrams: Can help to understand at which point of time which amount

Abstract
This document is submitted as the practical part of the GCIA Certified Forensic
Analyst program (GCFA)1.

fu
ll r

igh
ts.

This practical is in two parts of the practical, the first of which required an image of a floppy disk to
be analysed and a report submitted based upon the contents. During this part of
the practical, the investigator discovered traces of a steganographic program
(Camouflage.exe). The conclusion being that the owner and holder of the disk had
attempted to export company data via this hidden means.

rr

eta

ins

The second part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user).

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

fu
ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

eta

ins

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and information leakage and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis was a single Floppy Disk. The disk
received was identified and described as:
