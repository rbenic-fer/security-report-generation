The question as to whether the use conducted any illegal activity can be a difficult
one to answer as it can depend on many things. The pornography for example is
explicit but as to its breach of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 & 64 (OPA) the

On their site the OPA is defined as:

The law on obscene publications is difficult to define in everyday terms.
As a guide it could include images featuring acts of extreme sexual activity such as bestiality,
necrophilia, rape or torture.
Key fingerprint = AF19 FA27 2F94 998D FDB5 DE3D F8B5 06E4 A169 4E46
This act makes it an offence to publish, whether for gain or not, any article whose effect, taken
as a whole, is such, in the view of the court, to tend to "deprave and corrupt" those likely to
read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.

Although the names of the pornography video files did include on several occasions
the words rape, the belief is that many are either ‘staged’ or simply advertising tricks
to increase hits. Note – this is a legal
common renaming trick used by site owners to increase the size of their libraries
and to maintain customer interest. Detailed analysis of these files was not
performed.
There were also 30 music files and music videos, mainly of Elvis. They type and
quality of these indicates they were originally released by one of the major recording
labels. Their presence on the hard disk itself in not sufficient to prove they were
illegally obtained however, they are in two locations:
C:\My Shared

C:\Program Files\Grokster\My Shared Folder

With online music purchasing increasing exponentially in the UK, the user may
have an external device or other system where they legally acquire the files.
However, it is the belief of given the other files in these folders
(ie pornography) which are unlikely to be ‘purchased’ these music videos were also
downloaded via the peer-to-peer software especially as there were 4 different types
of peer-to-peer applications.

Therefore, a breach of the recording labels licence’s and IPR has occurred.
However, this is currently a topical subject both in the USA and Europe with USA
based companies using USA legislation against non US citizens outside the US
and as such, the acceptable levels and applicability of these laws and procedures
have yet to be determined.
