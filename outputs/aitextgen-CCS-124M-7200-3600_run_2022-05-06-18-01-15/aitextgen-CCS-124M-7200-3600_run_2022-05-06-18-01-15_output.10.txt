Abstract
This document is submitted as the practical part of the GCIA Certified Forensic
Analyst program (GCFA)1.

fu

igh
ts.

This practical is in two parts of the practical, the first of which required an image of a floppy disk to
be analysed and a report submitted based upon the contents. During this part of
the practical, the investigator discovered traces of a steganographic program
(Camouflage.exe). The conclusion being that the owner and holder of the disk had
attempted to export company data via this hidden means.

The second part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user).

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

fu
ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

eta

ins

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and information leakage and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

rr

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis was a single Floppy Disk. The disk
received was identified and described as:

Remember: All costs for software, hardware and training are reoccurring expenses. While the initial purchase of a forensic software is usually a one-time cost the reoccurring costs for
annual license renewals should never be forgotten. Since the prices of license updates and the
notification of hardware and software choices it is imperative that the user gives up on 22 August 2004,

Although the names of the pornography video files did include on several occasions
the words rape, the belief is that many are either ‘staged’ or simply advertising tricks
to increase hits. Note – this was a database of all the groups of pornography against the raw video files.

2.3.2

Acquisition of mobile devices

As with computer-based examinations, the aim during the acquisition of mobile devices is to
produce the best possible copy, or image, of data stored on the mobile device. With mobile devices
however, it may not be possible to make a full copy of the original content of the original content entered by the original. This may be
possible for some to be as if the original
storage medium and the copy contain exactly the same data.

The possibility to acquire the original data without changing the original evidence.
3.3.2.2.8 Verification / Hashing
Once the data has been acquired from the device in an acceptable fashion, then the
reports containing the data should be compiled and produced so officer can use the
reports to acquire the relevant data.
This is likely to analyse any such data (like IMEI and application settings) that are often best confirmed / acquired
during this stage.
Once all the required data has been acquired from the device in an acceptable fashion, then the
reports containing the desired data can be compiled and produced for the officer to review.
Prosecutor's considerations
Since the ultimate goal of a digital forensics process is to produce evidence to prove or
disprove disputed facts, electronic evidence must be obtained in compliance with existing
legislation and best practices to ensure admissibility at trials. It isCompliance with the legal defence in the future be able to
be aware of the legal procedures that the fact that given the equality of arms the defence will be
examining forensic findings, including provisional conclusions which might be challenged to sustain significant examination during the trial.

The possibility to acquire evidence must be ensured throughout the UK civil courts. Although in the USA, the majority of devices and
mobile devices are updated by the mobile devices. It is imperative that the user gives up on 22 August 2004,
believing the disk to be corrupt elects to scrap the data.
The possibility to acquire and analyse data that is remotely stored is highly depending on the user’s activities.
Administration
An important role within any laboratory is to opt for
the highest available processing power and a suitable data storage array.
Administration
The minimum entries for a case management system should be as follows:


The use of Faraday bags may be an alternative.



The user must be aware of the correct way to lift heavy items to avoid
injury.



The user menu



The user menu



The user menu



Detailed Analysis

The forensic big and small amounts of data a complete timeline was requested
and this was saved as ‘output/total-timeline’.

All this data is vitally vitally stored in the user home folder, that of (the
C:\Program
Files

The possibility to acquire and analyse data that is remotely stored is highly depending on the
legislation and jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions for example the forensic analyst - under certain
circumstances - is allowed to connect to the remote storage using the suspect's credentials from
the computer in order to acquire the data from the cloud provider. Other jurisdictions will not
accept such an acquisition. In those cases the official channels can be used in order to request
preservation and access to the data from the provider.
3.4.1.2.11 Computer Memory (RAM)

When computer memory has been acquired while the seized computer was still running (as the laboratory) and there was no way security to stored
preventing the data from the use.

The only glitch that was with the use of the external caddie which
connects IDE devices to either IEEE 1394 or USB2. While MS Windows was able
to address the device, Fedora Core 2 did not have any support for it in the kernel.
That said some research on the internet did reveal a patch had been submitted (see
below) which when applied allowed the external caddie to be mounted in the
Fedora Core 2 (FC2) OS in read only mode

Digital Forensics Guide

This Guide and the information contained in it are considered valid until 31 December
2018. Where conditions permit the Guide will be updated before that date to reflect any
relevant changes in technology, procedures and practices. Any person or organisation
wishing to use the Guide after the above date should contact the Council of Europe to
obtain the most recent version.

1.2

Who is the Guide for?

This Guide is designed for two specific categories of reader:
1.

Those responsible for the development and management of their digital forensics
laboratory that will form part of an overall digital forensics strategy,

2.

Staff employed within a digital forensics laboratory, in technical roles relating to the
digital forensics processes and procedures.

The guidance for the first group is designed to assist those responsible for developing digital
forensic strategies, making decisions about building the capacity to deal with digital forensics and
for those responsible for the management of laboratories. It is recognised that there is no single
solution applicable to all countries or even different organisations within countries. The guide is
designed to assist managers to make decisions about a subject with which many may not be
familiar.
The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of laboratory activities and the staff
that will carry out the function of acquisition, processing analysing and presenting electronic
evidence.
The guidance for this group will be more specific to the functions related to the

electronic evidence process and will allow procedures to be adopted that will meet requirements of
national and international criminal justice systems.
As aforementioned, prosecutors, prosecutorial and court assistants and other staff included
in criminal proceedings on substantive level, should be introduced to the contents of this guide in
parts which are of vital interest for the cases in their competence.

1.3

How should the Guide be used?

This Guide should be seen as a template document that can be used by countries to consider when
developing their digital forensics capability.

The advice given is intended to be used at both

strategic and tactical levels, according to their national legislation, practice and procedure.
The overarching principles described in the Electronic Evidence Guide are just as relevant to the
