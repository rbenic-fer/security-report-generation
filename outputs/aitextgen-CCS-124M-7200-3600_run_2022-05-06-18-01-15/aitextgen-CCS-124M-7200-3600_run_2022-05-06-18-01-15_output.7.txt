Passwords
The investigator then tried a few default passwords, starting with “password” which
was rejected. The next one tried was “Password” this was the correct password as

The “Password” was then tried on the other potential carrier file but it was not
accepted. At this point the investigator was slightly stumped and began to examine
the strings file for the FD to glean any possible password. After some time and
after trying several dozen passwords gold was struck. It closer examination
indicated that the password for the Password_Policy.doc file was the first part of
the file name, thus “Remote” was tried on the Remote_Access_Policy.doc file
and the following files were revealed to inside the carrier.

File Timings Explained
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when they are Modified, Accessed or Created
(called MAC times). Some like many UNIX flavours (inc Linux) apply stamps
time stamps on all activity (unless prohibited by the tool accessing the file).
Microsoft Windows however, will stamp full time and date information on

creation and modification but only date information on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, access it on the 2nd Nov, modify it on the 3rd Nov and copy it
onto separate media on the 4th; when the MACs are viewed on the 5th
however, it will appear to have been accessed and modified before it was
created.

As will be explained in the next section, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse this the file was made using
a program that retained the MAC times of the original carried files. Thus

The Software found and possibly used by Leszczynski

©

The program found on the disk went by the name of Camouflage. It is a
Steganographic Program that hides user selected data inside carrier files. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
attention of the messages.

The first frame from the footage on 7/25 shows that the date stamps show a one year difference
Since the raw video recordings both depict the same events in real time, the discrepancy in the date stamps year is
attributed to the two camera’s date stamps. Therefore, the date stamps embedded within the video file are consistent
with the date stamps of the folders in the video file names.
The example above shows a folder naming structure containing the “MyRecord” subdirectory. In the example above, the
root directory name contains a numeric date 4/9/2015, a subdirectory with a name 4/9/2015, and containing a video file with a file name 4/11/2015.
Contrary to folders, the last modified and created date stamps of a file is preserved when the parent folder it
resides in is copied from a source drive to a destination drive. Therefore, the last modified date stamps of the
has been created in individual cases they are consistent with the numeric dates
in the names of the other folders and files contained in the top level parent directory.

Log file generated
====================
File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  number of sensitive
data being analysed and these can be used to ascertain the settings of an
application at a given point in the past. Due to the closed nature of many operating systems and the lack
of available forensic solutions it may often be necessary to obtain a test device and conduct some live
research in order to identify the properties of some software artifacts.
3.4.1.2.4

E-mail messages

As with computer examinations, e-mail communications on mobile devices can be used within
default Mail applications and through web mail accessed through the internet browser. On some
devices, such as newer Apple iPhones, the extraction of email messages from the default Mail
application is not supported. In these cases the examiner will have to manually record the data or
attempt to gather this data from other sources.
3.4.2.2.5

Web history

Internet browsers on mobile devices typically store the following information that potentially has
evidential value:


Web history entries



Web page visit counts



Bookmarks / favorites



Cookies

The majority of this information, such as visit counts and cookies, are not accessible on most
devices.
Prosecutor's considerations
The analysis stage is of the the more important categories of cases. One of the
most important things to be considered should be cataloguing of the steps and evidence
which is gathered and secured.
Often evidence will be present in great numbers and their bulleting and listing can be
time consuming. Nevertheless, one must be persistent in this process having in mind
that this approach will lead to a logical explanation of the chain of evidence and the
criminal act itself.
The interpretation of the evidence must be taken very seriously and its importance well
understood. Forensic staff must be aware they will be summoned by the court and be in
a position to explain their procedures and findings in detail; their statements will be
examined both by the prosecution and defence, and, depending on the system, by the
judiciary. This situation can be of crucial importance for the success or failure of the
case and it must be taken seriously.
The analysis of the evidence should lead to clear and logical conclusions which should be
able to sustain significant examination during the trial.

3.5

Presentation stage

After evidence has been found in the analysis stage, the examiner needs a record of their actions,
arena:
Item 1 – Identification details for recovered Floppy Disk



The conclusion of a seizure any person questioned should be asked if they would initial each answer and sign
the bottom of each page if correct and write after the final entry words such as “I agree that this is a correct record
of what was said” and append his/her signature.

All persons seizing exhibits should initial relevant relevant entries and sign the page.
In cases where a person refuses to initial or sign an entry the senior person present should initial each answer
and sign each page.

If questions and answers cannot be written in one entry, continue into the next column below. A diagonal line
should be drawn through the exhibit entry column.

====================
File 'Exploit_Office' does not contain  Internal Memory or
data it contains. Certain types of errors received, such as
JTAG and Chip-Off will only make decisions about building the capacity to use the external caddie to carry out the function of acquisition.
3.2.2.6 Forensic process
Due to the requirement to use dedicated forensic tools to extract data, mobile phone data is often extracted
in a proprietary format. These formats can often be transfer between different decoding methods to leverage the
strengths of different decoding abilities. Other non-proprietary formats include bin files and raw
files.
40

Digital Forensics Guide

Another source of forensic evidence is a backup. Some users and devices will create backups of
themselves on other devices, such as the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connection device. Allowing examiners to acquire and analyse data that is remotely
 extracted from the mobile device.
owing the device to analyse is highly depending on the user and the knowledge of the
what is required from the device. This backups can assist in building
a time line of evidence and can also be used to gain access to the device. It is often best practice to not only
recover the data that extracted from the device.
Mobile devices, such as the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connection, data may be acquired that can jam be stored in a physical
examination. It is widely accepted that technology will continue to grow and criminals will commit more crimes
with the use of digital devices. It would therefore make sense to prepare for the growth of the device to set the capacity to deal with such issues. It is important to consider that peer support is an additional powerful counseling tool that is freely
available, if this working with an IDEN card, is an additional powerful counseling tool.
3.2.2.8 Verification / Hashing
Once the data has been extracted, this extracted data should be manually verified on the device.
This will require the forensic examiner checking that the data that has been extracted by the last inserted SIM card.
Managers should consider the exhibit introduction of data extraction by the “Rooting”. A physical
examination of this nature can be undertaken to confirm any errors with the user and if data is missing as often not
all chat messages, such as Facebook Messenger chat threads, are extracted from the device. If
there are any discrepancies then further extractions can be undertaken to try a acquire the correct password or conduct some live
research in order to acquire the correct password.
3.2.2.11 Computer Memory (RAM)

When computer memory has been acquired while the seized computer was still running (as
described in chapter 3.2.2.1), the memory dump can be analysed in
the forensics laboratory.
Understanding memory structures of different operating systems in order to analyse RAM is a
highly technical task. That is why it should only be done by examiners who are qualified for this
work. Specialised software is requited to analyse RAM dumps. Examples for such software include
"Volatility" and "Rekall". Typical artefacts that can be extracted from RAM dumps include:


Running processes including their memory



Process information (e.g. handles)



Encryption keys



Opened files



Usernames, passwords



Unsaved documents



and many more.

3.4.1.3 Virtualisation
A picture is worth a thousand words - this is particularly true for virtualisation. The forensic analyst
can view the operating system environment from a suspect's computer the same way as the
suspect has seen it. Finding evidence from within a virtual machine can sometimes be faster and
more expressive than reassembling data traces from the file system.
The forensic analyst should ensure that the image is mounted write-protect with a write cache
allowing the virtual operating system to write log files and changes to that write cache without
affecting the integrity of the image. Some operating systems refuse to start in virtual
environments. This can typically be solved by replacing drivers and adapting configurations, using
software like OpenGates and OpenJobs. Should the virtual operating system start with a password
prompt the forensic analyst needs to either crack that password or blank it.
3.4.1.4 Process for handling mass data
Some cases involve lots of computer systems and storage media while the workload for the
forensic laboratories is already very high. A separation between forensic analysis and content
