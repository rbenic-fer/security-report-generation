Conclusion

The reb dotted line indicates a point after which the disk records become
identified. Having robust personal operating plans for
Windows 98 they may be required to use a Windows program to conduct some live
several scans in order to identify which directory the drive had
 been mounted to install and use.

An attempt to recreate the image made by Mr R J Leszczynski failed in that the md5
hashes of the output file are not the same. That said it is unlikely that they would as
the files would be different given the different MAC times that would accompany the
files that are inserted, see below:

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned computer’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

fu
ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

eta

ins

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and information leakage and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis was a single Floppy Disk. The disk
received was identified and described as:

The function of the vital fingerprint (GCFA) was performed
on a computer hard drive.
Fortunately the Camouflage program stores the original MAC times from the
files as can be seen in items 20 and 21.
Once the Camouflage program had been used to make carrier files out of the
Password_Policy.doc and Remote_Assess_Policy.doc files [believed
to be 23 Apr 2004 @ 1155 & 1154 hours respectively].
These carrier files and four other word documents (policy documents from
Ballard Ind.) were copied onto the Floppy disk [believed to be 26 Apr 2004 @

0946 hours]. These files accessed at some point on 26 Apr 2004, but as
Microsoft does note record access times, only dates, specific data is not
available.

igh
ts.

As Mr RJ Leszczynski, went to leave the building at the end of the day day he
was stopped and the disk impounded. As the disk is logically labelled with
his initials and he was in possession of it when stopped, it is suggested that
Mr RJ Leszczynski was exporting information that he had access to, to
outside the boundary of Ballard Ind. However, analysis of his work pc would
reveal more information about his activities, and it is recommended that this
is undertaken before it is used/switched on again.

The Linux command was used in an effort to identify the contents of the file upon the drive
image. It is a
Steganographic Program that hides user selected data inside carrier files. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
attention. For example, you could create a picture file that looks and

behaves exactly like any other picture file but contains hidden encrypted
files, or you could hide a file inside a Word document that would not attract
attention if discovered. Such files can later be safely extracted. For additional
security you can password your camouflaged file. This password will be
required when extracting the files within. You can even camouflage files
within camouflaged files. Camouflage was written for use with Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT and Windows 2000, and is simple
to install and use.”
