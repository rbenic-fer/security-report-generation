The first and main point of call when a windows system is the registry.
The registry in Windows 98 was quit embryonic when compared to the likes of
Windows XP, with its separate user logons, separate data storage area and even even
separate software installs and permissions. When Microsoft was designing
Windows 98 they assumed the person sat in front of the system was authorised to
see and access all data. In modern IT Security terms it was a dedicated operating
system. As a result there is no ability to discern the particular users at any set time, to which point of time which amount of
money has been sent over which channel by which persons.

Education and training of all stakeholders computer hardware, with its separate user logons, separate data storage area and even
separate software installs and permissions. When an item required researching
on the identified and running a computer the forensic analyst needs to either crack that particular software, certain artefacts thatll allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the
the data that is live and accessible to the user.
3.4.1.2.7

Health and safety........................................................................................................ 55

The laboratory manager should take responsibility to ensure the health and safety of all staff and
the visitors to the laboratory. He should conduct risk assessments by examining current conditions
and situations and addressing anything thought to be hazardous or potentially damaging to health
or safety. The manager must also be aware of any legal health and safety requirements. Health
and safety measures apply equally in respect of people that may visit the laboratory and measures
must be put in place to ensure that they do not see or are subjected to illegal or distressing
materials. The possibility of this can be mitigated by following the ideas previously provided with
regard to the structure and set up of the laboratory.
These are some of the standard H&S features that are encountered in a digital forensics laboratory:


Anti-static mats and wrist straps – reducing the risk of static damage to equipment and
exhibits.



Contaminated Substances – preventing exposure with the use of surgical gloves or other
protective clothing.



Handling/lifting - ensuring staff are aware of the correct way to lift heavy items to avoid
injury.



Rubber matting - to reduce the risk of electric shock or damage to data.



Rubuit breakers - to reduce the risk of electric shock or damage to data.

Physical laboratory requirements

Once the location of suitable premises has been identified and the initial recruitment processes for
a digital forensics team are underway, it is important to consider the establishment of a physical
laboratory.

2.5.1

Office equipment

The size of any laboratory will dictate the amount of office equipment required.
Administrator desk - Ideally you will have a reception area that will require a reception desk
large enough to hold two monitors and two computers, a telephone and a significant amount of
paperwork. In addition, it would be beneficial to have an adjoining clear surface to deposit
incoming and outgoing exhibits and case papers to allow for the checking

Backing up the disk

The forensic analyst was able to image the hard disk without
any problems, it is surmised that the errors on the disk were software related. With
this in mind the investigator looked for recent software installations that may have

File Timings Explained

Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when they are Modified, Accessed or Created
(called MAC times). Some like many UNIX flavours (inc Linux) apply stamps
time stamps on all activity (unless prohibited by the tool accessing the file).
Microsoft Windows however, will stamp full time and date information on

creation and modification but only date information on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, access it on the 2nd Nov, modify it on the 3rd Nov and copy it
onto separate media on the 4th; when the MACs are viewed on the 5th
however, it will appear to have been accessed and modified before it was
created.

3. Examination methods

Some digital forensics facilities have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to display all files. They typically
have an air connected to computers due to lack of
memory space. Ideally the office will have a different address to a switch.
However, it is the belief of the investigator that the video files located on the floppy disk are
accurate representations of the same day.

directories. The numeric dates within the root of the flash drive. The five directories in the root
listed above delineate five separate dates of video recordings which is explained in further detail below.
The folders named with numeric dates contained video files. In total, there were 86 AVI video files on the flash drive.
The metadata for the AVI video files does not contain any metadata or unique file signatures to indicate the video
recording device that was used to create the video. Review of the video content reveals that the video files were
captured from two separate video recording devices which are separated into the Investigator 1 and Investigator 2

to any given video file. Examples of the folder and file naming schemes are shown below.

root directory structure contains a numeric date of 7/25/2014, a subdirectory with a name containing the numeric date
7/25/2014, and containing a video file with a file name including the numeric date 7/25/2014. Another example of the
folder and file naming structure is shown below.

You might also see the OEM ID "MSWIN4.0" on disks formatted by
Windows 95 and "MSWIN4.0" on disks formatted by Windows 95 OEM

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried, however the first check was requested
 by the investigator.

The only glitch that was presented was with the use of the external caddie which
connects IDE devices to either IEEE 1394 or USB2. While MS Windows was able
to address the device, Fedora Core 2 did not have any support for it in the kernel.
That said some research on the internet did reveal a patch had been submitted (see
below) which when applied allowed the external caddie to be mounted in the
Fedora Core 2 (FC2) OS in read only mode.
