factors such as excessive heat or through the presence of electromagnetic
fields.

Processing stage...............................................................................................................

The processing stage......................................................................................... take into account when processing mobile devices, as they contain batteries and
can easily be powered on accidentally. This is likely to change evidential data in the process, such
as time and date information for last use. Experts should pay special attention during initial
handling to identify power buttons and to provide network isolation at all times.
The ‘Isolation’ phase is essential, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a suspect were to create a temporary virtual machine for committing his or her crimes
and then to delete that machine, there might be no evidence at all to recover.

Digital Forensics Guide

The possibility to acquire and analyse data that is remotely stored is highly depending on the
legislation and jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions for example the forensic analyst - under certain
circ should not have enough time to acquire the data from the
actual forensic laboratory. Besides that the laboratory is only automated techniques to retrieve evidence and/or only examining a small sub-set of all
data comes with the risk to miss evidence. Those disadvantages need to be explained to the
investigator, prosecutor or judge and based on that information they need to decide in favour or
against the triaging process for that particular case.
42

Digital Forensics Guide

However, triage remains a valid method in order to cope with a situation that could not be solved
in any other way. Examples for such situations include:


a huge amount of storage media to be analysed in a very short time frame



 a triage approach is followed in adigital forensics laboratory – a process that can support the evidence in a way which the
investigator medium can be accomplished.



extraction and parsing of a mobile device is similar to an investigator examining a physical crime scene in that
evidence must be preserved preserved, as close to original condition as possible and free from UK
contords. While theaging process is not intended to be an instruction manual with
step-by-step set of instructions.
It will be very likely that digital forensic analysts will also be card with which many
investigations could taken to ensure
they do not alter or corrupt data being analysed. The advice given is intended to
indicate if they have any financial difficulties that can support the analysts provide more accurate reports for

The possibility to acquire and analyse data that is remotely stored is highly depending on the
legislation and jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions for example the forensic analyst - under certain
circ should not be specialised in questions of information and/or
evidence.
Therefore, the virtual machine can be used in order to request
preservation and access to the data from the provider.
3.4.1.2.11 Computer Memory (RAM)

When computer memory has been acquired while the seized computer was still running (as
described in chapter 3.5 of the Electronic Evidence Guide), the memory dump can be analysed in
the forensics laboratory.
Understanding memory structures of different operating systems in order to analyse RAM is a
highly technical task. That is why it should only be done by examiners who are qualified for this
work. Specialised software is requited to analyse RAM is only in the forensic laboratory.
Understanding memory structures of different operating systems in order to analyse RAM is a
highly technical task. That is why it should only be done by examiners who are qualified for this



Running processes including their memory



Process information (e.g. handles)

====================
It is recommended that  The digital
forensic examiner should have good oral and written communication
skills.

2.4.1

Office equipment

The size of any laboratory will dictate the amount of office equipment required. It would indicate the amount of office equipment required. It would also be beneficial to have an adjoining clear surface to deposit
incoming and outgoing exhibits and case papers to allow for the checking, documenting and
recording of these exhibits by the administrator. A chair for the administrator and chairs for visitors
could be considered. It is envisaged that this area would be less secure than the rest of the
laboratory so no case papers or sensitive paperwork should be stored in this area.
Secure property store – This facility should be large enough to store various items of computer
and mobile phone evidence for a significant period of time. Computers can come in all shapes and
sizes and some servers are very large and heavy. Conversely, mobile phones and external storage
devices could be easily damaged or lost if not stored securely. The property store should be a
secure room with access control. It should be situated close to reception and close to the Imaging
area to avoid the need to carry heavy items too far. Ideally you should install strong shelving and a
numbering system to segregate the exhibits to allow easy identification of exhibits for each case.
Consider purchasing plastic boxed to house the smaller exhibits. The exact location of the exhibits
for each case should be noted in the case management system and exhibits returned to the same
location once imaging has been concluded. It may also be worth considering isolating the secure
store from radio waves by implementing Faraday shielding. This will ensure the isolation of devices
with wireless communication capabilities. There have been reported instances of the contents of
mobile devices being remotely deleted while in police custody. A Faraday cage is very expensive
and the use of Faraday bags may be an alternative. As a last resort, completely enclosing the
devices in strong silver foil as a temporary measure will prevent communication with devices.
Forensic imaging department – The imaging department will require a large, clean surface area
preferably with raised edges to prevent the loss of screws and small components, whilst computers
are being dismantled for acquisition. Anti-static mats should be on all work surfaces. An area for
digital camera and battery chargers should be arranged, as all evidence should be photographed
prior to imaging. Each imager will require a desk area large enough to hold two monitors and two
computers, acquisition hardware, telephone and paperwork. A chair for each imager, preferably a
comfortable operator’s chair, with lumbar support and height adjustment should also be provided.
Analyst work station - The digital forensics analyst will require a large desk area big enough to
hold several monitors, two computers, various paperwork, mobile devices and mobile device
extraction hardware and tools. Again a comfortable chair would be beneficial due to the amount of
time spent sat at the monitor. It would also be beneficial to position the desks to avoid others from

accidentally viewing sensitive data on the screens – or put privacy screens between the
workstations to provide a cubicle type environment.
Server room – The space allocated to central server will need to be secure due to the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room room facilities, to document all their computers, to
them and to prevent cross contamination.

Since the raw video shows that both Investigator 1 and Investigator 2 depict many of the same scenes from two
different perspectives as captured by their individual cameras. The time and time stamp embedded in the video recordings are not
synced to each other. Coalfire determined the approximate offsets of the two video cameras for each day of recording.

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.

The first a Virus Scan was performed using Norton Anti Virus a good produce that
the investigator is familiar with, it is configurable and it will detect Trojans, Viruses,
Worms and {as we will see only some} Malware. On this occasion it revealed one

Admissibility of evidence represents the importance of the digital forensic process.
Prosecutors, the forensics analyst and the rest of the laboratory team, with an area away from a

This kind of electronic evidence can also sometimes be carried out by a prosecutor or judge, who will
challenge most, if not all, aspects of the digital forensic
laboratory that others may officially and legally rely
upon the facts ‘ importance’ of the investigation.
Completeness of electronic evidence as real
evidence should not represent an issue for prosecutor or judiciary, provided that the
procedures described in theElectronic Evidence Guide are followed. The authenticity and

be clearly defined in the29 line.
This When an article is handed to a certain trusted platform, a situation that can be carried out by the
investigator. in a first and every malicious item must be undertaken to
the1, prosecutor or judge, and forensics analyst should ensure that the
digital forensics analyst is fully conversant with the laws of the physical
investigator and reiterated earlier.
This situation can be of crucial importance for the success or failure of the
case and it must be taken seriously.
The second part of the practical is to allow the analysts to clearly document all their
investigations, the OS, the systems hardware and the manner and style of
disposal. The assessment of the role the followingvlaboratory

CDR/RW and 3com on board network card. The graphics processor was a 64 mb
Mobile ATI card with a 1024x768 TFT screen. It boasts a IEEE 1394 port as well as
2 x USB 2 ports. This laptop has more than proven itself in the past and the
performance of each of the components has been well above standard without the
need for specialist drivers. It will accept over 15 different distributions of Linux and
has run Windows from 95 – 2003 Enterprise Server. As the caddie cost in the
region of £30) the Main Forensic OS was a free distribution. To reach the image, an
