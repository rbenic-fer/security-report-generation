Prosecutor's considerations
The analysis stage will be particular in the analysis of a dedicated application and the location of
evidence used for the investigation and trial phases of criminal proceedings.
As will be present very J explained some evidence to show the special
characteristics of electronic evidence as laid out in the Electronic Evidence Guide.

Report writing

The digital forensics report reflects all the procedures and outcomes of the steps that have been
conducted before. It is the only one outcome of all the prior work and as such it is the key element
for all other persons within the criminal justice system.
The nature of the report that it is being used in courts to help proving guilt or innocence of a
person does not only make it an extremely important document but also causes some challenges
for the forensic analyst. One of the biggest challenges is to make the report understandable for
non-technical people. So a forensic report must establish the
 That a forensic report has been written in a compact format.
This report should consist of the following main chapters:

Acquisition of a report

In a jurisdictions, the digital forensics analyst should tell a Health and
Safety requirement for the
forensic analyst to ensure the integrity of the evidence and protect the
the visitors to any opinion based in a digital forensics laboratory.
This can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will ensure that the
device data is correctly counted, especially having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an
equitable interest arising only from transfer or grant back).

Stroz Friedberg found substantial evidence that all three of the Word documents
containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date and time at which computer activity, such as the creation or modification
of documents, occurred. Backdating can be accomplished by setting the system clock
on a computer hard drive to an earlier date, such that activity that occurs on the hard
drive while the computer is in a backdated state will appear to have occurred at that
earlier time.
Moreover, the last printed date of the document is February 15, 2011, while the

What is not included

The guide does not make any recommendations regarding hardware and software choices that may
be available. Each country and organisation will decide what is appropriate given their needs and
available funds. It should be remembered that digital forensics equipment and commercial software
can be a very expensive long term commitment and is not easy to change once the initial decision
is made. Details of the types of costs associated with forensic software purchases and information
about some options to use open source software are dealt with elsewhere in this document.

The floppy disk was installed into the external caddie and connected to the USB port
of the investigators patched laptop. The Linux dd command was used to copy
portions of the /dev directory in an attempt to identify which directory the drive had
been mounted to. This had proved in the investigators experience to be the best
method as the /dev directory used by the kernel varied between devices and USB
ports. The procedure involved using dd with the syntax below:

©

#/ dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/mount_test1
This was executed and allowed to run for several seconds before being interrupted
and the output file being examined with vi. If the output file was blank a different
/dev/ folder would b selected. Success was often being achieved within 2
guesses.
Once the correct directory was identified a dcfldd18 command was executed to
image the whole drive.

The dcfldd command (written by the Defence Computer Forensics Lab as

improvement over the native dd command. The labs basically modified the native
dd command so it performs an MD5 hash of the HDD as it images it (in the above
screenshot it is the ‘hashlog’) and it also displays the counters showing the

3.3.1.5 Data recovery
Recovering deleted data can be essential if no evidential files have been found in the allocated
areas of the disk. Data recovery is possible on different levels. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a disk are shown in the forensic forensic forensic laboratory. Those gaps should be scanned for additional partitions. The next one tried is ‘ - ’ which shows’ which files the forensic analyst has to view and analyses. Popular filtering that then the forensic analyst has found those files.

regarding the different levels of support, see chapter 3.2.2.6).
Also at this stage, a review of the role the mobile device with the processing from the officer in

be the only yet resource-intensive way, which will confirm or what level of

 mobile devices, unlike computer devices, have further acquisition strategies. The other main
strategy is a File System Dump (FSD). An FSD is like a hybrid of a Physical and a Logical
acquisition. FSDs retrieve the devices file system and interpret the data during the processing
stage. This allows examiners to retrieve, for example, databases holding deleted messages that
may not be available at a logical acquisition and may not be accessible at a logical acquisition and may not be accessible during a physical
acquisition. However, not all deleted data that it would be possible to retrieve with a physical
acquisition would be acquired during an FSD.
A logical acquisition of the mobile device will involve receiving information from the device and
allowing the device to present the data for analysis. This is often the equivalent of accessing the
data on the device itself. This method typically will only make live data available to the examiner. If
no other method is available, a method termed ‘ acquired’ can be used. This method
involves accessing the device and recording the data displayed on the screen, with photographs,
video recording or transc continuity

Digital forensics analyst should ensure that the data is returned to a data protection certain devices, such as
leuthkit, cookies, etc. If the mobile device is not isolated and allowed to
connect to external networks, such as the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connection, data may be changed on the device. One example is that it is possible to remotely wipe
some mobile devices.
Isolation can be achieved through different forms:


Production of a ‘Laboratory SIM/IDEN card’ – a SIM/IDEN card that appears to the
device as the original SIM/IDEN card but lacks
 capability to actually connect to the
mobile network. A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) / Integrated Digital Enhanced
Network (IDEN) identifies the subscriber to the network which the mobile device wishes to
connect to

shielding installed to prevent network isolation.

jurisdictions.
The best method will depend on local laws, laboratory set up and on the device being examined.
Consideration should also be applied to prevent connection to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals.
Before proceeding with acquiring the mobile device exhibit, it must be identified. The device will
often have an equipment label affixed to the inside of the handset, if it is a mobile telephone, or
printed on the back of the device. The label will include an International Mobile Equipment Identify
