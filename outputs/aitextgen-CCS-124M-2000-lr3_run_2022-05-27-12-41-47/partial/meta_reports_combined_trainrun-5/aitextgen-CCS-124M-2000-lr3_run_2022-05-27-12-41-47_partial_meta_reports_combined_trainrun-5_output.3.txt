Department of Att Camera (incalfire reviewed every file in this
M entered by Det. BROWN is used to create a raw DD image of a file
 structure that looks and behaves the chip times/videos.
Depending on the techniques used some software, the acquisition process can vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise certain areas of the data to
recover the most appropriate data. This process can cause some data to be irrecoverably lost; this is normally only system
files with little to no evidential value. The knowledge of what is altered by any of these processes
can be demonstrated by holding appropriate training certifications, such as training provided by the
manufacturers of mobile forensics software, or practical experience involving the testing of what
data, if any, on the device is altered by making these system changes.
3.2.5 Hardware and software
Analysis of mobile devices typically requires the use of dedicated software and the correct cable.
Some additional, dedicated tools will include stand-alone extraction tools. More advanced
examination techniques, such as JTAG or Chip-Off will require further tools, including soldering
equipment and specialist jigs to read raw data from the device’s memory chips.
