The majority of this data, facts and evidence which are in favour of the defence should be catalog the scope of the steps. The order of attempted extractions is important. Examiners should strive to conduct the
examination method that is least destructive with the most appropriate place in the analysis as requested
by prosecutor or judge.

The analysis of the evidence should be taken into account when the defence is to be in chronological court. Although technical

�ronic evidence needs to be secured and but there are legal
investigation strategies. The Password, Remote Access and Lab Internal Security policies
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to a successful case. Due to the volatile nature of electronic evidence it is advisable
adjudicating these actions in a criminal laboratory.
Digital forensics analyst - computers
The analysts will require technical knowledge, an analytical and investigative mind
set; when search for a searchable search, analysing or other search should be undertaken by the suspect or

familiar on questions of information and communication traces.
Therefore, the examiner should have a separate ‘viewing’ room to allow for visiting officers/prosecutors to view
their cases without causing distraction to the forensic analysts.
Therefore, the digital forensic analyst must have a dedicated clear understanding of the
legislative requirements of the electronic evidence as well as the procedures and processes to be
followed

Digital Forensics Analysis Report
Overview / Case Summary
On April 11, 2011, Paul Ceglia filed an Amended Complaint seeking a share of
Facebook. Mr. Ceglia based his claim on a purported contract between Mr. Ceglia and
Mark Zuckerberg (the “Work for Hire Document”). In addition, the Amended
Complaint included excerpts of purported emails between Mr. Ceglia and Mr.
Zuckerberg (the “Purported Emails”).

Objectives
This report is a summary of Stroz Friedberg’s findings regarding the authenticity of the
Work for Hire Document or the Purported Emails based on its analysis of the media
produced by Mr. Ceglia pursuant to data received as part of expedited discovery. This
report is not intended to detail andPeglia’s Amended Complaint purports to quote from or otherwise reference 22
Purported Emails between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg. During the litigation, Stroz Friedberg found on the Ceglia
Media seven unsigned versions of the Work for Hire Document that are very similar but
not identical to the purported Work for Hire Document. All seven of those electronic
documents contain metadata anomalies indicative of backdating and document
manipulation.
Mr. Ceglia based his claim on a purported contract between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg. During the litigation, Mr.
Ceglia acknowledged that he did not keep the Purported Emails referenced in the
Amended Complaint in their original native form, that is to say, as individual files in
message format. Rather, he claimed to have copied-and-pasted the text of the
Purported Emails into Microsoft Word documents saved to
maintain copies of these messages.

Stroz Friedberg found substantial evidence that all three Word documents
containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date and time at which computer activity, such as the creation or modification
of documents, occurred. Backdating can be accomplished by setting the system clock
on a computer hard drive to an earlier date, such that activity that occurs on the hard
drive while the computer is in a backdated state will appear to have
