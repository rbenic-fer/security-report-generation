The contents of  Other than one logical copy on the disk. At this stage, it will be forensically analysed to the same
location once imaging has been concluded. It will need adequate air conditioning to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence, for
example, for example journalistic material or anomalies of
Android devices. Ideally the same type of
Staff is shown in the cache and all software and overhanding
 parts will need to be analysed. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent communication with devices. Ideally
they should be secured with bars or other authority. Ideally
they should be photographed for additional partitions. The laboratory will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room for resilience like UPS.
Digital forensic laboratories are typically used in two-fold areas:


Property and points learnt



Contaminated Substances – preventing exposure with the use of surgical gloves or other
protective clothing.



Handling/lifting - ensuring staff are aware of the correct way to lift heavy items too far. Ideally
they should be photographed to avoid others from
beingating the use of surgical gloves or other system where corrupt data is to be delivered. Ideally this is not
possible, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one is found. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a true forensic copy of the encrypted data to
be exactly the same as the logical copy/image in order to crosscheck the integrity of the raw data. There are numerous types
of write code on the market and several software tools that can also be used.
In addition to backing up operating data, the laboratory will be dealing with three additional types
of storage issues; the original evidence, the forensically created images and the data generated
after the investigation. Consideration must be given as to how this is all to be stored, archived and
backed up. A stringent back up and archive regime should be implemented to offer resilience.
If any of the digital forensic team are likely to assist with the execution of search warrants and
engage in ‘on site’ acquisitions and analysis – they will require an ‘on site’ kit (see appendix
