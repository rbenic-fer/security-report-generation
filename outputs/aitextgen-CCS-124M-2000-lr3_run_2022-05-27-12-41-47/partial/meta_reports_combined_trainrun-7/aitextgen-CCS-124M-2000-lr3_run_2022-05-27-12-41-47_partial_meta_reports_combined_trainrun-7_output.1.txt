It is important that, at all stages of an examination, the mobile device under scrutiny is isolated

Network (IDEN) identifies the subscriber to the network which the mobile device wishes to

Acquisition in a network shielded room – The space allocated to central server will need to be secure due to the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room for resilience like UPS.
