Coalfire reviewed any and all inconsistencies in timecode apparent in the Full Footage videos for comparison to the raw
video footage corresponding to those videos. Notes were made upon review of the raw video content which described

building. “Waiting” footage consists of Investigator 1 and 2 waiting to engage with primary Planned Parenthood
