Executive Summary
In September, 2015, CGS, the prime contractor on behalf of Alliance Defending Freedom, engaged Coalfire Systems, Inc.,
the sub-contractor (hereinafter “Coalfire”) to conduct a computer forensics analysis of certain raw video and audio data
files. Coalfire’s objectives for this project are to:
-

Forensically evaluate video and audio files provided by The Center for Medical Progress (“the Organization”)
through CGS (“raw” video and audio), and determine whether the raw video or audio content of the files have
been edited or otherwise altered;

-

Compare the raw video and audio to certain files posted to YouTube (“Full Footage” videos and a
“Supplemental” video) for the purpose of determining inconsistencies between the files.

A scope of Coalfire’s analysis did not cover or include:
-

Validation of those individuals depicted in the video or audio, who recorded the video and audio files, the
location where they were recorded, when they were recorded, or the purpose of the recordings;

-

Providing an opinion on the chain of custody prior to receipt of source materials by Coalfire;

-
Coalfire’s analysis was limited to only the source materials received from the Organization and did not include
interviews of participants in the videos or audio.

A flash drive containing recorded media was received via FedEx by Coalfire on September 17th, 2015, where it was
examined using industry-standard forensic tools and techniques. The flash drive contained (i) a total of ten (10) videos
with a total of eight (2) separate devices, and (ii) a total of eight (8) audio recordings made with two (2) separate devices.
Coalfire’s analysis of the recorded media files contained on the flash drive indicates that the video recordings are
authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or editing. This conclusion is supported by the consistency of the video
file date and time stamps, the video timecode, as well as the folder and file naming scheme. The uniformity between the
footage from the cameras
