Digital Forensics Guide

A digital forensic analyst should typically aim for a full physical copy of a whole disk because it
includes deleted and formerly allocated areas. However, when dealing with encryption a logical
copy of the unlocked data is preferred to a physical copy of the encrypted data. There can also be
situations during a search and seizure operation where creating a physical copy might not be
possible, out-of-scope or simply not covered by the warrant or other authority.
Both, the physical and the logical copy can be written in different ways. Either they are cloned,
which means that the data is directly copied bit-by-bit from one storage medium to another, or
they are written as an image file, which means that all data is copied bit-by-bit from one storage
medium into one or more image files on a target medium. The latter technique is the more
common one as writing the data into an image file offers some advantages as laid out in the
following chapter.
3.2.1.7 Forensic image formats
Besides a raw image (raw/dd) that contains all data of the original medium within a raw file there
are a few commonly accepted forensic image formats available. Those forensic imaging formats
have in common that they are not able to be easily manipulated due to built-in checksums and
case metadata. The most common formats are the Expert Witness Format (EWF(x)01) and
the Advanced Forensic Format (AFF). They include features like:


Compression of data



Encryption of data



Error-Checks



Case Metadata



Hash sums



Hash sums



Splitting the image in chunks

In addition to that, different forensic software solutions come with their own propitiatory image
formats with similar features. However, a forensic image format should be chosen that is supported
by the largest variety of software.
Special attention should be given to the image format when the image is to be analysed in a

The Hard disk was installed into the external caddie and connected to the USB port
of the investigators patched laptop. The Linux dd command was used to copy
portions of the /dev directory in an attempt to identify which directory the drive had
been mounted to. This had proved in the investigators experience to be the best
method as the /dev directory used by the kernel varied between devices. The procedure involved using dd with the syntax below:

©

#/ dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/mount_test1
This was executed and allowed to run for several seconds before being interrupted
and the output file being examined with vi. If the output file was blank a different
/dev/ folder would b selected. Success was often being achieved within 2
guesses.
Once the correct directory was identified a dcfldd18 command was executed to
image the whole drive.

The dcfldd command (written by the Defence Computer Forensics Laboratory as
indicated by the ‘dcfl’ bit inform of the dd) was used image process as it is an
improvement over the native dd command. The labs basically modified the native
dd command so it performs an MD5 hash of the HDD as it images it (in the above
screenshot it is the ‘hashlog’) and it also displays the counters showing the
progress of the execution.

Once the whole disk image had been performed an md5 hash was taken of the
source drive and this was compared with dcfldd hashlog. As these were found to
be exactly the same the investigator has assumed the image to be a bit-for-bit
