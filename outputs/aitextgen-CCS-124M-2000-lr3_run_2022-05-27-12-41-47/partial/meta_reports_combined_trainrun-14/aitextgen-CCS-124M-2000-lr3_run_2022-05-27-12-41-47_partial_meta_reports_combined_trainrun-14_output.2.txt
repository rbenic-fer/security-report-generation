The contents of.............................................................., media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, tags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
The building or office selected should be large enough to expand if there is an anticipated increase
in demand for digital forensic investigation.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility.
Many existing digital forensics facilities have found it necessary to relocate or expand in a short
space of time due to exponential increases in workload. The information gathered during the
research phase will give a good idea of the likely need for future expansion. It is extremely
expensive to relocate or expand, so it may be beneficial to provide room for expansion in the initial
business plan.

Air conditioning

Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be
purchased and installed in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.

Staff

It is likely that the person scoping and preparing the business case will be the laboratory manager
or will be involved in the recruitment of such a Manager. Best practice shows that the laboratory
manager should be involved in the recruiting of the staff that will be employed to carry out the
different roles within the laboratory.
Depending on the size of the laboratory and the required number of staff they must consider the
different functions that are required. Staff roles and responsibilities will need to be documented and
detailed job descriptions should be prepared so that each member of the team has a clear
understanding of their job profile. Where possible the structure of a digital forensics capability
should incrementally allow for staff to be able to advance within the organisation, rather than
leaving. It is accepted that this is only possible within a facility with plentiful resources, however it

Creation of the Working Copy
A copy was then taken of the image file and the ‘output/body’ image placed in
a separate folder. All activities were conducted on the ‘output/body’. If the
working copy had become corrupt at any point new version could be made form the
