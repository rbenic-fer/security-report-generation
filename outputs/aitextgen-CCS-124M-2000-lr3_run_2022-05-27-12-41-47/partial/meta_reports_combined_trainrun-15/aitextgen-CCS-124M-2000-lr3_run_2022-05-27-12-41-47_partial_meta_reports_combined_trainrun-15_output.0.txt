that it is the case. Stroz Friedberg
also found what it believes to be the authentic contract between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg. During the litigation, Mr.
Ceglia acknowledged that he did not keep the Purported Emails referenced in the
Amended Complaint in their original native form, that is to say, as individual files in
message format. Rather, he claimed to have copied-and-pasted the text of the
Purported Emails into Microsoft Word documents saved to floppy disks in order to
maintain copies of these messages.

Stroz Friedberg found substantial evidence that all three of the Word documents
containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date and time at which computer activity, such as the creation or modification
of documents, occurred. Backdating can be accomplished by setting the system clock
on a computer hard drive to an earlier date, such that activity that occurs on the hard
drive while the computer is in a backdated state will appear to have occurred at that
earlier time.
Moreover, the last printed date of the document is February 15, 2011, while the
document’s last modified date is April 25, 2003. As discussed above, absent
backdating or manipulation of the system clock, it is not possible for a file’s last printed
date to post-date its last modification date. Therefore, this document was fabricated on
or after February 15, 2011. This date is years after the Work for Hire Document was
allegedly signed and months after Mr. Ceglia filed this lawsuit.

Conclusion
Stroz Friedberg found direct and compelling digital forensic evidence that the
documents relied upon by Mr. Ceglia to support his claim are forged. Stroz Friedberg
also found what it believes to be the authentic contract between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg. During the “Ceglia” timecodes, Stroz Friedberg found that the
 fabricated with the “-0400” time zone stamp that
reflects Eastern Daylight Time. However, Eastern Daylight Time was not in effect

What is not included

The guide does not make any recommendations regarding hardware and software choices that may
be available. Each user depends in some tables. It should be remembered that digital forensics equipment and commercial software
can be a very expensive long term commitment and is not easy to change once the initial decision
is made. Details of the types of costs associated with forensic software purchases and information
about some options to use open source software are dealt with elsewhere in this document.

1.2

Who is the Guide for?

This Guide is designed for two specific categories of reader:
1.

Those responsible for the development and management of their digital forensics
laboratory that will form part of an overall digital forensics strategy,

2.

Staff employed within a digital forensics laboratory, in technical roles relating to the
digital forensics processes and procedures.

The guidance for the first group is designed to assist those responsible for developing digital
forensic strategies, making decisions about building the capacity to deal with digital forensics and
for those responsible for the management of laboratories. It is recognised that there is no single
solution applicable to all countries or even different organisations within countries. The guide is
designed to assist managers to make decisions about a subject with which many may not be
familiar.
The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of laboratory activities and the staff
