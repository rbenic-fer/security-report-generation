digital camera and battery chargers should be arranged, as all evidence should be photographed
prior to imaging. Each imager will require a desk area large enough to hold two monitors and two
computers, acquisition hardware, telephone, telephone, paperwork, etc. A chair for each imager, preferably a
comfortable operator’s chair, with lumbar support and height adjustment should also be provided.
