electronic evidence needs to be acquired in a forensically sound manner. Acquisition of data is
typically conducted by collecting volatile data from a mobile service provider.

3.3

Processing stage

During processing the forensic examiners may prioritise certain devices or data and can produce an
exact copy or image of the content of any digital storage seized. Working on the duplicate (never
the original) they can apply smart, case-specific filters (data mining) or they can just process the
image (e.g. by recovering deleted files, mounting containers, breaking encryption, parsing
application data like internet history, chat logs, etc.). Those processing steps are often times
repeatable for specific categories of cases. Even though they are resource intensive needing a lot of
computing power and time they can typically be run over-night, over the weekend
or on a second medium which is not in use.

3.3.1

Processing of mobile devices

As with computer-based examinations, the aim during the acquisition of mobile devices is to produce a forensically sound copy/image of the
computer's storage media the digital forensics analyst needs to ensure this copy/image with a write cache
forensic boot medium. This way a forensic examiner can process
multiple exhibits at the same time, even overnight or on weekends. With this method, the forensic examiner can concentrate
his/her resources on the setup of the triaging process for the exhibits and can view the reports of
previously processed computers while the new chunk of exhibits is being processed by the triage
boot medium automatically.
3.3.1.3 Prioritisation matrix
Mobile devices are presented with three distinct media that require separate handling and
investigation techniques:


SIM / IDEN Cards – Requires specialist mobile phone forensic tools and equipment.



Memory Cards – Can be examined as a computer hard disk or flash drive.



Device’s Internal

Next up was a scan for Spyware, this was conducted using the PCtools Spyware
Doctor (www.pctools.com/spy). If the Norton result was bad, the
Spyware doctor result was horrendous, as it discovered 85 instances of Spyware or
Trojans.
