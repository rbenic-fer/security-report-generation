1.1. Case-specific considerations
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when they are Modified, Accessed or Created
(called MAC times). Some like many UNIX flavours (inc Linux) apply stamps
time stamps on all activity (unless prohibited by the tool accessing the file).
Microsoft Windows however, will stamp full time and date information on

creation and modification but only date information on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, access it on the 2nd Nov, modify it on the 3rd Nov and copy it
onto separate media on the 4th; when the MACs are viewed on the 5th
however, it will appear to have been accessed and modified before it was
created.

As will be explained in the next section, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained the MAC times of the original carried files. Thus
when the carried files are exported from the carrier file a new instance is
written to the new media and although this will have a different creation time
again, it will retain the original accessed and modification times.
