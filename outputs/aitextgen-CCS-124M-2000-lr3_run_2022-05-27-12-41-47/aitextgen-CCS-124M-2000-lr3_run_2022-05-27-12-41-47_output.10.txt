This software will store a suspect’s browsing history as well as details of his or her downloads, form
inputs, cookies, etc., but it can either be disabled or deleted by the suspect. Another example can
be the “Start suspect’s Office programs that ‘remember’ which files the suspect has
opened recently. There are various types of ‘avoidable’ traces automatically stored on the hard disk
in this way (as shown in the table below). However, they can be prevented by someone who knows
what they are doing.
Unavoidable traces: By contrast, unavoidable traces are, of course, those that cannot be disabled
or those that require considerable effort to stop temporarily. The probability of finding such traces
is correspondingly high even if a suspect has tried to cover his or her tracks.

3.4.1.2 Procedures for different traces
Every case typically involves some particularly relevant traces. In a fraud case for example
documents, spreadsheets and e-mails are typically more relevant while in child-abuse cases
pictures,pictures, emails and communication traces are more relevant. But even within those categories of
cases not every case is the same. That is why the following subchapters included information on
procedures based on the type of type that is relevant rather than the type of case.
3.4.1.1.2.1

E-Mails

To analyse e-mail communication it is not only important to analyse mail clients like Outlook,
Thunderbird or Mail but also webmail accounts. The former will be covered in this subchapter while
the latter will be covered in section 3.4.1.2.4.
In order to analyse an e-mail client it is important to know which artefact that e-mail client
produces. Outlook for example stores evidential data in personal folder files such as PST, OST and
PAB files while Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files. The forensic software suites can usually
parse those files. However, they do not necessarily extract all messages. Some forensic tools, for
example, have problems extracting deleted messages from personal folder files.
3.4.1.2

Office documents

In cases in which office documents are of importance the digital forensics analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst the forensic analyst should ensure that the documents were
dated by Mr. Ceglia to support his claim are followed at the letter of
the report.
Further explanation of the report is to be found in the Electronic Evidence Guide and reiterated earlier on in these operating processes. In a typical case the analyst should ensure that the documents were

should incrementally allow analysis of all existing digital data. Depending on the size of the laboratory, several technicians may
be required. The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of each member of the team
to be able to advance within each vacancy. When Microsoft was designing
Windows 98 they assumed the person sat in front of the system was authorised to
see and access all data. In modern IT Security terms it was a very likely scenario to be " recovery capabilities,” “temouflage” access Web Site.

this reason it may be beneficial to first be necessary in the past. Due to the majority of devices which have been legitimately acquired, the digital
forensic examiner should be step-for-step set of instructions. These
files were recorded as being ‘of interest’ and would be subjected to closer
examination later.

 Presfacts

Filving

Due to the processing and
 processing of the laboratory, the processing of a storage medium can be undertaken to
be analysed in a forensically sound manner.
3.2.1.3 Prioritisation of data
Prioritisation of data can be seen in close conjunction with triage. While due to time constrains or
limited resources triaging excludes the analysis of each and every piece of evidence, priorisation
would still allow analysis of all exhibits. It would however start with more relevant exhibits to see
whether this might contain enough evidence for a conviction or acquittal. Examples for a
prioritisation would be to analyze:


the main suspect's computer before witness’s PC,



urgent cases / high profile cases before low profile cases,



encrypted data before unencrypted data, and



certain data types (e.g. documents, emails into logical order, etc)



certain data types (e.g. documents, emails, emails into logical
Word documents and internet browser documents) on the floppy disk.

3.2.1.4 Automated processing

Acquisition of mobile devices, and with acode-based verification returns to MFT, the believed processing software.

The processing stage can be of vital importance to the prosecution. Although the processing of computer systems is not
in any cases. examiner needs to be able to
support all actions, prior to the acquisition of electronic
evidence. A key skill requirement
is attention to detail and the ability to clearly document all their actions, the verification of imaged
data and the continuity of evidence.
Prosecutors should be interested in all stages of the process, the verification of imaged
data and the continuity of evidence.
Prosecutors’ considerations are very important for criminal justice officials who are
involved in a contemporary court. Consideration must be followed.
As to any other processes, the necessary only specialised
evidence should be followed to the terms of the prosecutor’s actions.
This procedure carries less risk for the examiner. Although the first different processing tasks
is required in a fraud case the other stages of the practical processes and procedures.

What is not included

The guide does not make any recommendations regarding hardware and software choices that may
be available. Each country and organisation will decide what level of
can be appropriate given their needs and
available funds. It should be remembered that digital forensics equipment and commercial software
can be a very expensive long term commitment and is not easy to change once the initial decision
is made. Details of the types of costs associated with forensic software purchases and information
about some options to use open source software are dealt with elsewhere in this document.

3.4

Staff stage

During processing the forensic examiners may prioritise certain devices or data and will produce an
exact copy or image of the content of any digital storage seized. Working on the duplicate (never
the original) they can apply smart, case-specific filters (data mining) or they can just process the
image (e.g. by recovering deleted files, mounting containers, breaking encryption, parsing
application data like internet history, chat logs, etc.). Those processing steps are often times
repeatable for specific categories of cases. Even though they are resource intensive needing a lot of
computing power and time they can typically be run over-night, over-night, over the weekend or on a second
forensic workstation that is not in use.

3.4.1

Internet browser

Internet browsers are of evidential value for a lot of cases. They typically contain the following techniques:


Website of a ‘Laboratory SIM/IDEN card’ – a SIM/IDEN card that appears to the
device as the original SIM/IDEN card but lacks the capability to actually connect to the

extraction card or a Disk in a network shielded room). The A physical acquisition of a mobile device is similar to the

and timle live prior to examination of the data.
Mobile devices, unlike computer devices, have further acquisition strategies. The other main
strategy is a File System Dump (FSD). An FSD is like a hybrid of a Physical and a Logical
acquisition. FSDs retrieve the devices file system and interpret the data during the processing
stage. This allows examiners to retrieve, for example, databases holding deleted messages that
may not be available at a logical acquisition and may not be accessible at a logical acquisition and may not be accessible during a physical
acquisition. However, not all deleted data that it would be possible to retrieve with a physical
acquisition would be acquired during an FSD.
A logical acquisition of the mobile device will involve receiving information from the device and
allowing the device to present the data for analysis. This is often the equivalent of accessing the
data on the device itself. This method typically will only make live data available to the examiner. If
no other method is available, a method termed ‘manual examination’ can be used. This method
involves accessing the device and recording the data displayed on the screen, with photographs,
video recording or transcribing the data. Care should be taken to ensure that data is not unnecessarily changed and information is recorded accurately. With this method, you can only
recover the data which the mobile device displays, for example some mobile devices will not show
full time and date information.
For mobile devices that are damaged or locked, two other methodologies can be utilised. These are
JTAG and Chip-Off examinations. JTAG examination requires the examiner to retrieve a full physical copy of the data, however this requires the modification of a from the mobile�

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.
