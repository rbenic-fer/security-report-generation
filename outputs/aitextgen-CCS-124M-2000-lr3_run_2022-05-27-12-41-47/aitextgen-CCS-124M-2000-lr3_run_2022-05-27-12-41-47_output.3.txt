The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was to allow the investigator see for the first time the directory structure.
Additionally, as both the mount command and the Linux file permissions were set to
read-only, browsing could be undertaken without fear of altering the data.

A cursory examination of this the root of the system, would confirm the file
identification of the early personal edition of Windows. Files like the
autoexec.bat and config.sys are not used on windows NT.
The FAT32 file structure was then tried on the windows NT.com file and the source drive:

A look at the purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.

Internet browser

Internet browsers are of evidential value for a lot of cases. They typically contain the following
artefacts which need to be analysed:


Website visit history



Local cache / temporary internet files



Bookmarks / favorites



Sessions information



Cookies



Saved usernames and passwords



Entries from form fields



Internet searches

Analysing browser artefacts can be important for suggesting purpose or intent (e.g. keywords used
in search engines could prove intent). That is why those artefacts should be analysed in most
cases.

Digital Forensics Guide

The most popular browsers are Google Chrome, Google Firefox, Mozilla Firefox
and Apple Safari. All of which store their data in all operating systems within the user home
directory. user log files are either a subdirectory named ‘Spyblocker’ or simply advertising tricks
