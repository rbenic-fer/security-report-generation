												<p>Roughly one year ago, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/who-and-what-is-coinhive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lengthy investigation</a> into the individuals behind <strong>Coinhive[.]com</strong>, a cryptocurrency mining service that has been heavily abused to force hacked Web sites to mine virtual currency. On Tuesday, Coinhive announced plans to pull the plug on the project early next month.</p>
<div id="attachment_46735" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46735" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-46735" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/coinhive-rip.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="366" /><p id="caption-attachment-46735" class="wp-caption-text">A message posted to the Coinhive blog on Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019.</p></div>
<p>In March 2018, Coinhive was listed by many security firms as the top malicious threat to Internet users, thanks to the tendency for Coinhive’s computer code to be surreptitiously deployed on hacked Web sites to steal the computer processing power of its visitors’ devices.</p>
<p>Coinhive took a whopping 30 percent of the cut of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero_(cryptocurrency)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero currency</a> mined by its code, and this presented something of a conflict of interest when it came to stopping the rampant abuse of its platform. At the time, Coinhive was only responding to abuse reports when contacted by a hacked site&#8217;s owner. Moreover, when it would respond, it did so by invalidating the cryptographic key tied to the abuse.</p>
<p>Trouble was, killing the key did nothing to stop Coinhive&#8217;s code from continuing to mine Monero on a hacked site. Once a key was invalidated, Coinhive would simply cut out the middleman and <em>proceed to keep 100 percent of the cryptocurrency mined by sites tied to that account from then on</em>.</p>
<p>In response to that investigation, Coinhive made structural changes to its platform to ensure it was no longer profiting from this shady practice.</p>
<p><strong>Troy Mursch</strong> is chief research officer at <a href="https://badpackets.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bad Packets LLC</a>, a company that has closely chronicled a number of high-profile Web sites that were hacked and seeded with Coinhive mining code over the years. Mursch said that after those changes by Coinhive, the mining service became far less attractive to cybercriminals.</p>
<p>&#8220;After that, it was not exactly enticing for miscreants to use their platform,&#8221; Mursch said. &#8220;Most of those guys just took their business elsewhere to other mining pools that don&#8217;t charge anywhere near such high fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Coinhive noted in the statement about its closure, a severe and widespread drop in the value of most major crytpocurrencies weighed heavily on its decision. At the time of my March 2018 piece on Coinhive, Monero was trading at an all-time high of USD $342 per coin, according to charts maintained by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/#charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coinmarketcap.com</a>. Today, a single Monero is worth less than $50. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/crytpo-mining-service-coinhive-to-call-it-quits/#more-46733" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A Russian court has handed down lengthy prison terms for two men convicted on treason charges for allegedly sharing information about Russian cybercriminals with U.S. law enforcement officials. The men &#8212; a former Russian cyber intelligence official and an executive at Russian security firm <strong>Kaspersky Lab</strong> &#8212; were reportedly prosecuted for their part in an investigation into <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=pavel+vrublevsky&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pavel Vrublevsky</a>, a convicted cybercriminal who ran one of the world&#8217;s biggest spam networks and was a major focus of my 2014 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spam-Nation-Organized-Cybercrime-Epidemic-ebook/dp/B00L5QGBL0/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Spam Nation</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sergei Mikhailov</strong>, formerly deputy chief of Russia&#8217;s top anti-cybercrime unit, was sentenced today to 22 years in prison. The court also levied a 14-year sentence against <strong>Ruslan Stoyanov</strong>, a senior employee at Kaspersky Lab. Both men maintained their innocence throughout the trial.</p>
<p>Following their dramatic arrests in 2016, many news media outlets reported that the men were suspected of having tipped off American intelligence officials about those responsible for Russian hacking activities tied to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because two others arrested for treason at the same time &#8212; Mikhailov subordinates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/world/europe/russian-hacker-fsb-agent-dmitry-dokuchaev.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgi Fomchenkov and Dmitry Dokuchaev</a> &#8212; were reported by Russian media to have helped the FBI investigate Russian servers linked to the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee. The case against Fomchenkov and Dokuchaev has not yet gone to trial.</p>
<p>What exactly was revealed during the trial of Mikhailov and Stoyanov is not clear, as the details surrounding it were classified. But according to information <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/a-shakeup-in-russias-top-cybercrime-unit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported by KrebsOnSecurity in January 2017</a>, the most likely explanation for their prosecution stemmed from a long-running grudge held by <strong>Pavel Vrublevsky</strong>, a Russian businessman who ran a payment firm called <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ChronoPay&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChronoPay</a> and for years paid most of the world’s top spammers and virus writers to pump malware and hundreds of billions of junk emails into U.S. inboxes. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/former-russian-cybersecurity-chief-sentenced-to-22-years-in-prison/#more-46717" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Payroll software provider <strong>Apex Human Capital Management</strong> suffered a ransomware attack this week that severed payroll management services for hundreds of the company&#8217;s customers for nearly three days. Faced with the threat of an extended outage, Apex chose to pay the ransom demand and begin the process of restoring service to customers.</p>
<p>Roswell, Ga. based <a href="https://apexhcm.com/about-us/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apex HCM</a> is a cloud-based payroll software company that serves some 350 payroll service bureaus that in turn provide payroll services to small and mid-sized businesses. At 4 a.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 19, Apex was alerted that its systems had been infected with a destructive strain of ransomware that encrypts computer files and demands payment for a digital key needed to unscramble the data.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-46701" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/apexupdates.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="639" /></p>
<p>The company quickly took all of its systems offline, and began notifying customers that it was trying to remediate a security threat. Over a series of bi-hourly updates, Apex kept estimating that it expected to restore service in a few hours, only to have to walk back those estimates almost every other time a new customer update went out.</p>
<p>Contacted Wednesday by an Apex client who was nervous about being unable to make this week&#8217;s payroll for his clients, KrebsOnSecurity reached out to Apex for comment. <strong>Ian Oxman</strong>, the company&#8217;s chief marketing officer, said the ransomware never touched customer data, but instead encrypted and disrupted everything in the company&#8217;s computer systems and at its off-site disaster recovery systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had just recently completed a pretty state-of-the-art disaster recovery plan off-site out and out of state that was mirroring our live system,&#8221; Oxman said. &#8220;But when the ransomware bomb went off, not only did it go through and infect our own network, it was then immediately picked up in our disaster recovery site, which made switching over to that site unusable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oxman said Apex hired two outside security firms, and by Feb. 20 the consensus among all three was that paying the ransom was the fastest way to get back online. The company declined to specify how much was paid or what strain of ransomware was responsible for the attack.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote pqright">&#8220;We paid the ransom, and it sucked,&#8221; Oxman said. &#8220;In respect for our clients who needed to get their businesses up and running that was going to be obviously the quicker path.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately for Apex, paying up didn&#8217;t completely solve its problems. For one thing, Oxman said, the decryption key they were given after paying the ransom didn&#8217;t work exactly as promised. Instead of restoring all files and folders to their pre-encrypted state, the decryption process broke countless file directories and rendered many executable files inoperable &#8212; causing even more delays.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they encrypt the data, that happens really fast,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When they gave us the keys to decrypt it, things didn&#8217;t go quite as cleanly.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/payroll-provider-gives-extortionists-a-payday/#more-46708" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Fraud investigators say they&#8217;ve uncovered a sophisticated new breed of credit card skimmers being installed at gas pumps that is capable of relaying stolen card data via mobile text message. KrebsOnSecurity has since learned those claims simply don&#8217;t hold water.</p>
<p>An earlier version of this story cited an alert sent by the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> and interviews with a company that helps merchants secure their payment terminals. The claims were that a circular device found on the side of a gas pump was a skimmer that was believed to be responsible for communicating with other Bluetooth-based skimmers found embedded in the pumps, and that its purpose was to gather stolen card data and send it off wirelessly to the skimmer thieves via text message.</p>
<p>Since that story was published, I heard from a reader who works in security for the company that owns the compromised filling station in question. This person asked not to be quoted directly, but shared information showing that the mysterious circular device was not a Bluetooth anything. Rather, he said, it is little more than a GPS-based tracker that can be bought at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpyStreet-GPS-SC3-Real-Time-Waterproof-Rechargeable/dp/B077RR72V7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://thespystore.com/gps-tracker-real-time-gps-sc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other online stores</a> for about $100-$150.</p>
<p>The source shared a clearer image of the &#8220;skimmer,&#8221; and a review of the components shown there indicate this thing is indeed a GPS tracker &#8212; the kind of device that a suspicious husband or wife might attach to the undercarriage of the family car to track the other&#8217;s whereabouts in real time:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-46693" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/newskim2.jpg" alt="" width="592" height="704" /></p>
<p>The most likely explanation as to why this tracker was on the side of a gas pump to begin with is that someone who was being tracked discovered it and left it at the station. The source also said claims that this was found beneath an NFC reader on the pump are not correct either. However, he said it <em>was</em> true that there were multiple gas pumps at the station that were internally compromised with Bluetooth skimming devices.</p>
<p>While I am not wild about having to post this correction, I also don&#8217;t believe it would be right to simply unpublish the original story &#8212; flawed as it is. So in the interests of full transparency, what follows is the original piece, minus the lede.</p>

												<p>The U.S. government &#8212; along with a number of leading security companies &#8212; recently warned about a series of highly complex and widespread attacks that allowed suspected Iranian hackers to siphon huge volumes of email passwords and other sensitive data from multiple governments and private companies. But to date, the specifics of exactly how that attack went down and who was hit have remained shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>This post seeks to document the extent of those attacks, and traces the origins of this overwhelmingly successful cyber espionage campaign back to a cascading series of breaches at key Internet infrastructure providers.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mideastglobe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-46628" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mideastglobe.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="256" /></a></p>
<p>Before we delve into the extensive research that culminated in this post, it&#8217;s helpful to review the facts disclosed publicly so far. On Nov. 27, 2018, <strong>Cisco&#8217;s Talos</strong> research division <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a write-up</a> outlining the contours of a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign it dubbed &#8220;<strong>DNSpionage</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DNS part of that moniker refers to the global &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>D</strong>omain <strong>N</strong>ame <strong>S</strong>ystem</a>,&#8221; which serves as a kind of phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly Web site names (example.com) into numeric Internet address that are easier for computers to manage.</p>
<p>Talos said the perpetrators of DNSpionage were able to steal email and other login credentials from a number of government and private sector entities in Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates by hijacking the DNS servers for these targets, so that all email and virtual private networking (VPN) traffic was redirected to an Internet address controlled by the attackers.</p>
<p>Talos reported that these DNS hijacks also paved the way for the attackers to obtain SSL encryption certificates for the targeted domains (e.g. webmail.finance.gov.lb), which allowed them to decrypt the intercepted email and VPN credentials and view them in plain text.</p>
<p>On January 9, 2019, security vendor <strong>FireEye</strong> <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released its report</a>, &#8220;Global DNS Hijacking Campaign: DNS Record Manipulation at Scale,&#8221; which went into far greater technical detail about the &#8220;how&#8221; of the espionage campaign, but contained few additional details about its victims.</p>
<p>About the same time as the FireEye report, the <strong>U.S. Department of Homeland Security</strong> issued a rare emergency directive <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/blog/#why-cisa-issued-our-first-emergency-directive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordering</a> all U.S. federal civilian agencies to secure the login credentials for their Internet domain records. As part of that mandate, DHS published a short list of domain names and Internet addresses that were used in the DNSpionage campaign, although those details did not go beyond what was previously released by either Cisco Talos or FireEye.</p>
<p>That changed on Jan. 25, 2019, when security firm <strong>CrowdStrike</strong> <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/widespread-dns-hijacking-activity-targets-multiple-sectors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a blog post</a> listing virtually every Internet address known to be (ab)used by the espionage campaign to date. The remainder of this story is based on open-source research and interviews conducted by KrebsOnSecurity in an effort to shed more light on the true extent of this extraordinary &#8212; and ongoing &#8212; attack.</p>
<div id="attachment_46592" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46592" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-46592" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cs-ips.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="568" /><p id="caption-attachment-46592" class="wp-caption-text">The &#8220;indicators of compromise&#8221; related to the DNSpionage campaign, as published by CrowdStrike.</p></div>
<h4>PASSIVE DNS</h4>
<p>I began my research by taking each of the Internet addresses laid out in the CrowdStrike report and running them through both <a href="https://www.farsightsecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Farsight Security</a> and <a href="https://securitytrails.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecurityTrails</a>, services that passively collect data about changes to DNS records tied to tens of millions of Web site domains around the world.</p>
<p>Working backwards from each Internet address, I was able to see that in the last few months of 2018 the hackers behind DNSpionage succeeded in compromising key components of DNS infrastructure for more than 50 Middle Eastern companies and government agencies, including targets in Albania, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>For example, the passive DNS data shows the attackers were able to hijack the DNS records for <strong>mail.gov.ae</strong>, which handles email for government offices of the United Arab Emirates. Here are just a few other interesting assets successfully compromised in this cyber espionage campaign:</p>
<p><strong>-nsa.gov.iq:</strong> the National Security Advisory of Iraq<br />
<strong>-webmail.mofa.gov.ae:</strong> email for the United Arab Emirates&#8217; Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br />
<strong>-shish.gov.al:</strong> the State Intelligence Service of Albania<br />
<strong>-mail.mfa.gov.eg:</strong> mail server for Egypt&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br />
<strong>-mod.gov.eg:</strong> Egyptian Ministry of Defense<br />
<strong>-embassy.ly:</strong> Embassy of Libya<br />
<strong>-owa.e-albania.al:</strong> the Outlook Web Access portal for the e-government portal of Albania<br />
<strong>-mail.dgca.gov.kw:</strong> email server for Kuwait&#8217;s Civil Aviation Bureau<br />
<strong>-gid.gov.jo:</strong> Jordan&#8217;s General Intelligence Directorate<br />
<strong>-adpvpn.adpolice.gov.ae:</strong> VPN service for the Abu Dhabi Police<br />
<strong>-mail.asp.gov.al:</strong> email for Albanian State Police<br />
<strong>-owa.gov.cy:</strong> Microsoft Outlook Web Access for Government of Cyprus<br />
<strong>-webmail.finance.gov.lb:</strong> email for Lebanon Ministry of Finance<br />
<strong>-mail.petroleum.gov.eg:</strong> Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum<br />
<strong>-mail.cyta.com.cy:</strong> Cyta telecommunications and Internet provider, Cyprus<br />
<strong>-mail.mea.com.lb:</strong> email access for Middle East Airlines</p>
<p>The passive DNS data provided by Farsight and SecurityTrails also offered clues about when each of these domains was hijacked. In most cases, the attackers appear to have changed the DNS records for these domains (we&#8217;ll get to the &#8220;how&#8221; in a moment) so that the domains pointed to servers in Europe that they controlled.</p>
<p>Shortly after the DNS records for these TLDs were hijacked &#8212; sometimes weeks, sometimes just days or hours &#8212; the attackers were able to obtain SSL certificates for those domains from SSL providers <a href="https://www.comodo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comodo</a> and/or <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>. The preparation for several of these attacks can be seen at <a href="https://crt.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crt.sh</a>, which provides a searchable database of all new SSL certificate creations.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at one example. The CrowdStrike report references the Internet address <strong>139.59.134[.]216 </strong>(see above), which according to Farsight was home to just seven different domains over the years. Two of those domains only appeared at that Internet address in December 2018, including domains in Lebanon and &#8212; curiously &#8212; Sweden.</p>
<p>The first domain was &#8220;<strong>ns0.idm.net.lb</strong>,&#8221; which is a server for the Lebanese Internet service provider <a href="https://www.idm.net.lb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDM</a>. From early 2014 until December 2018, ns0.idm.net.lb pointed to <strong>194.126.10[.]18</strong>, which appropriately enough is an Internet address based in Lebanon. But as we can see in the screenshot from Farsight&#8217;s data below, on Dec. 18, 2018, the DNS records for this ISP were changed to point Internet traffic destined for IDM to a hosting provider in Germany (the 139.59.134[.]216 address).</p>
<div id="attachment_46593" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46593" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-46593" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/idm-net-lb.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="602" /><p id="caption-attachment-46593" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Farsight Security</p></div>
<p>Notice what else is listed along with IDM&#8217;s domain at 139.59.134[.]216, according to Farsight:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46594" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/139.59.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="249" /></p>
<p>The DNS records for the domains <strong>sa1.dnsnode.net</strong> and <strong>fork.sth.dnsnode.net</strong> also were changed from their rightful home in Sweden to the German hosting provider controlled by the attackers in December. These domains are owned by <a href="https://www.netnod.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netnod Internet Exchange</a>, a major global DNS provider based in Sweden. Netnod also operates one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 &#8220;root&#8221; name servers,</a> a critical resource that forms the very foundation of the global DNS system.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll come back to Netnod in a moment. But first let&#8217;s look at another Internet address referenced in the CrowdStrike report as part of the infrastructure abused by the DNSpionage hackers: <strong>82.196.11[.]127</strong>. This address in The Netherlands also is home to the domain <strong>mmfasi[.]com</strong>, which Crowdstrike says was one of the attacker&#8217;s domains that was used as a DNS server for some of the hijacked infrastructure.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46597" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/82-196.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="409" /></p>
<p>As we can see in the screenshot above, 82.196.11[.]127 was temporarily home to another pair of Netnod DNS servers, as well as the server &#8220;<strong>ns.anycast.woodynet.net</strong>.&#8221; That domain is derived from the nickname of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Woodcock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Woodcock</a>, who serves as executive director of <a href="https://www.pch.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packet Clearing House (PCH)</a>.</p>
<p>PCH is a nonprofit entity based in northern California that also manages significant amounts of the world&#8217;s DNS infrastructure, particularly the DNS for more than 500 top-level domains and a number of the Middle East top-level domains targeted by DNSpionage. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/a-deep-dive-on-the-recent-widespread-dns-hijacking-attacks/#more-46589" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Federal authorities this week arrested a North Carolina man who allegedly ran with a group of online hooligans that attacked Web sites (including this one), took requests on Twitter to call in bomb threats to thousands of schools, and tried to frame various online gaming sites as the culprits. In an ironic twist, the accused &#8212; who had fairly well separated his real life identity from his online personas &#8212; appears to have been caught after a gaming Web site he frequented got hacked.</p>
<p>On Feb. 12, the <strong>U.S. Justice Department</strong> announced the arrest of <strong>Timothy Dalton Vaughn</strong>, a 20-year-old from Winston-Salem, N.C. Vaughn is alleged to have been a key member of the <strong>Apophis Squad</strong>, a gang of ne&#8217;er-do-wells who made bomb threats against thousands of schools and launched distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Web sites — including KrebsOnSecurity on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>The feds say Vaughn used multiple aliases on Twitter and elsewhere to crow about his attacks, including &#8220;<strong>HDGZero</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>WantedByFeds</strong>,&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Xavier Farbel</strong>.&#8221; Among the Apophis Squad&#8217;s targets was encrypted mail service <a href="https://www.protonmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protonmail</a>, which reached out to this author last year for clues about the identities of the Apophis Squad members after noticing we were both being targeted by them and receiving demands for money in exchange for calling off the attacks.</p>
<p>Protonmail later <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/leader-of-ddos-for-hire-gang-pleads-guilty-to-bomb-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly thanked</a> KrebsOnSecurity for helping to bring about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-46482790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the arrest</a> of Apophis Squad leader <strong>George Duke-Cohan </strong>&#8212; a.k.a. &#8220;opt1cz,&#8221; &#8220;7R1D3n7,&#8221; and &#8220;Pl3xl3t,&#8221; &#8212; a 19-year-old from the United Kingdom who was convicted in December 2018 and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/12/bomb-threat-hoaxer-ddos-boss-gets-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sentenced to three years in prison</a>. But the real-life identity of HDGZero remained a mystery to both of us, as there was little publicly available information at the time connecting that moniker to anyone.</p>
<div id="attachment_45028" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45028" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45028" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/as-booter.png" alt="" width="594" height="523" /><p id="caption-attachment-45028" class="wp-caption-text">The DDoS-for-hire service run by Apophis Squad listed their members.</p></div>
<p>That is, until early January 2019, when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/01/03/town-of-salem-hacked-leaving-more-than-7-6m-with-compromised-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news broke</a> that hackers had broken into the servers of computer game maker <strong>BlankMediaGames</strong> and made off with account details of some 7.6 million people who had signed up to play &#8220;Town of Salem,&#8221; the company&#8217;s browser-based role playing game. That stolen information has since been posted and resold in underground forums.</p>
<p>A review of the leaked BlankMediaGames user database shows that in late 2018, someone who selected the username &#8220;hdgzero&#8221; signed up to play Town of Salem, registering with the email address <strong>xavierfarbel@gmail.com</strong>. The data also shows this person registered at the site using a Sprint mobile device with an Internet address that traced back to the Carolinas. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/bomb-threat-hoaxer-exposed-by-hacked-gaming-site/#more-46569" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Microsoft on Tuesday issued a bevy of patches to correct at least 70 distinct security vulnerabilities in <strong>Windows</strong> and software designed to interact with various flavors of the operating system. This month&#8217;s patch batch tackles some notable threats to enterprises &#8212; including multiple flaws that were publicly disclosed prior to Patch Tuesday. It also bundles fixes to quash threats relevant to end users, including critical updates for <strong>Adobe Flash Player</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>, as well as a zero-day bug in <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="" width="229" height="240" />Some 20 of the flaws addressed in February&#8217;s update bundle are weaknesses labeled &#8220;critical,&#8221; meaning Microsoft believes that attackers or malware could exploit them to fully compromise systems through little or no help from users &#8212; save from convincing a user to visit a malicious or hacked Web site.</p>
<p>Microsoft patched a bug in Internet <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Exploder</span> Explorer (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0676</a>) discovered by <strong>Google</strong> that attackers already are using to target vulnerable systems. This flaw could allow malware or miscreants to check for the presence of specific files on the target&#8217;s hard drive.</p>
<p>Another critical vulnerability that impacts both end users and enterprises is a weakness in the Windows component responsible for assigning Internet addresses to host computers (a.k.a. “Windows DHCP client”). That flaw, <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0626</a>, could let an attacker execute malcode of his choice just by sending the target a specially crafted DHCP request.</p>
<p>At the top of the list of patch concerns mainly for companies is a publicly disclosed issue with <strong>Microsoft Exchange</strong> services (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0686</a>) that could allow an attacker on the same network as the target to access the inbox of other users. Microsoft said it has not seen active exploitation of this bug yet, but considers it likely to be exploited soon. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/patch-tuesday-february-2019-edition/#more-46434" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Email provider <strong>VFEmail</strong> has suffered what the company is calling &#8220;catastrophic destruction&#8221; at the hands of an as-yet unknown intruder who trashed all of the company&#8217;s primary and backup data in the United States. The firm&#8217;s founder says he now fears some 18 years&#8217; worth of customer email may be gone forever.</p>
<p>Founded in 2001 and based in Milwaukee, Wisc., VFEmail provides email service to businesses and end users. The first signs of the attack came on the morning of Feb. 11, when the company&#8217;s Twitter account started fielding reports from users who said they were no longer receiving messages. VFEmail&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/VFEmail/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account</a> responded that &#8220;external facing systems, of differing OS&#8217;s and remote authentication, in multiple data centers are down.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vfemail.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-46528" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vfemail.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="279" /></a></p>
<p>Two hours later, VFEmail <a href="https://twitter.com/VFEmail/status/1095021927972909056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that it had caught a hacker in the act of formatting one of the company&#8217;s mail servers in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;nl101 is up, but no incoming email,&#8221; read <a href="https://twitter.com/VFEmail/status/1095022045501579264" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tweet</a> shortly thereafter. &#8220;I fear all US based data my be lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At this time, the attacker has formatted all the disks on every server,&#8221; wrote VFEmail. &#8220;Every VM [virtual machine] is lost. Every file server is lost, every backup server is lost. Strangely, not all VMs shared the same authentication, but all were destroyed. This was more than a multi-password via ssh exploit, and there was no ransom. Just attack and destroy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an update posted to <a href="https://www.vfemail.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company&#8217;s Web site</a>, VFEmail owner <strong>Rick Romero</strong> wrote that new email was being delivered and that efforts were being made to recover what user data could be salvaged.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this time I am unsure of the status of existing mail for US users,&#8221; Romero wrote. &#8220;If you have your own email client, DO NOT TRY TO MAKE IT WORK. If you reconnect your client to your new mailbox, all your local mail will be lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached by KrebsOnSecurity on Tuesday morning, Romero said he was able to recover a backup drive hosted in The Netherlands, but that he fears all of the mail for U.S. users may be irreparably lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have very high expectations of getting any U.S. data back,&#8221; Romero said in an online chat. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/email-provider-vfemail-suffers-catastrophic-hack/#more-46523" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>A highly targeted, malware-laced phishing campaign landed in the inboxes of multiple credit unions last week. The missives are raising eyebrows because they were sent only to specific anti-money laundering contacts at credit unions, and many credit union sources say they suspect the non-public data may have been somehow obtained from the <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/about-ncua" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Credit Union Administration</a> (NCUA), an independent federal agency that insures deposits at federally insured credit unions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Patriot Act</a>, passed in the wake of the terror attacks of Sept 11, 2001, requires all financial institutions to appoint at least two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Secrecy_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bank Secrecy Act</a> (BSA) contacts responsible for reporting suspicious financial transactions that may be associated with money laundering. U.S. credit unions are required to register these BSA officers with the NCUA.</p>
<p>On the morning of Wednesday, Jan. 30, BSA officers at credit unions across the nation began receiving emails spoofed to make it look like they were sent by BSA officers at other credit unions. </p>
<p>The missives addressed each contact by name, claimed that a suspicious transfer from one of the recipient credit union&#8217;s customers was put on hold for suspected money laundering, and encouraged recipients to open an attached PDF to review the suspect transaction. The PDF itself comes back clean via a scan at Virustotal.com, but the body of the PDF includes a link to a malicious site.</p>
<div id="attachment_46497" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46497" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-46497" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bsa-email.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="390" /><p id="caption-attachment-46497" class="wp-caption-text">One of the many variations on the malware-laced targeted phishing email sent to dozens of credit unions across the nation last week.</p></div>
<p>The phishing emails contained grammatical errors and were sent from email addresses not tied to the purported sending credit union. It is not clear if any of the BSA officers who received the messages actually clicked on the attachment, although one credit union source reported speaking with a colleague who feared a BSA contact at their institution may have fallen for the ruse.</p>
<p>One source at an association that works with multiple credit unions who spoke with KrebsOnSecurity on condition of anonymity said many credit unions are having trouble imagining another source for the recipient list other than the NCUA.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to think of any public ways that the scammers might have received a list of BSA officers, but sites like LinkedIn require contact through the site itself,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;CUNA [the Credit Union National Association] has BSA certification schools, but they certify state examiners and trade association staff (like me), so non-credit union employees that utilize the school should have received these emails if the list came from them. As far as we know, only credit union BSA officers have received the emails. I haven’t seen anyone who received the email say they were not a BSA officer yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder where they got the list of BSA contacts at all of our credit unions,&#8221; said another credit union source. &#8220;They sent it to our BSA officer, and [omitted] said they sent it to her BSA officers.&#8221; A BSA officer at a different credit union said their IT department had traced the source of the message they received back to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The NCUA has not responded to multiple requests for comment since Monday. The agency&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/files/publications/regulations/credit-union-profile-form-instructions-4501A-9302017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions for mandatory BSA reporting</a> (PDF) state that the NCUA will not release BSA contact information to the public. Officials with CUNA also did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>A notice posted by the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s <strong>Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</strong> (FinCEN) said the bureau was aware of the phishing campaign, and was urging financial institutions to disregard the missives.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 11:13 a.m. ET:</strong> Multiple sources have now confirmed this spam campaign also was sent to BSA contacts at financial institutions other than credit unions, suggesting perhaps another, more inclusive, entity that deals with financial institutions may have leaked the BSA contact data.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 5:26 p.m. ET:</strong> The NCUA responded and released the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon learning of the recent spear phishing campaign targeting Bank Secrecy Act officers at credit unions, the NCUA conducted a comprehensive review of its security logs and alerts. This review is completed, and it did not find any indication that information was compromised.</p>
<p>The most recent information available indicates the campaign extends beyond credit unions to other parts of the financial sector.</p>
<p>The NCUA encourages all credit union staff to be wary of suspicious emails, and credit unions may report suspicious activity to the agency. Additional information about phishing and other information security concerns is available on the agency’s Cybersecurity Resources webpage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, the Treasury Department responded to requests for information about this event, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>FinCEN is aware of the phishing attempts and we’re examining the circumstances. There is no indication that any FinCEN systems were compromised.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/314bfactsheet.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here is some information on 314(b) from our website</a>  </p>
<p>Note that the 314(b) system is designed so that individual compliance officers (registered with FinCEN) can find and directly contact each other. It provides no access to any type of broad financial database.</p></blockquote>

												<p>Prosecutors in Northern California have charged two men with using <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/busting-sim-swappers-and-sim-swap-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unauthorized SIM swaps</a> to steal and extort money from victims. One of the individuals charged allegedly used a hacker nickname belonging to a key figure in the underground who&#8217;s built a solid reputation hijacking mobile phone numbers for profit.</p>
<p>According to indictments <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/two-men-indicted-sim-swapping-scheme-steal-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsealed</a> this week, Tucson, Ariz. resident <strong>Ahmad Wagaafe Hared</strong> and <strong>Matthew Gene Ditman</strong> of Las Vegas were part of a group that specialized in tricking or bribing representatives at the major wireless providers into giving them control over phone numbers belonging to people they later targeted for extortion and theft.</p>
<p>Investigators allege that between October 2016 and May 2018, Hared and Ditman grew proficient at SIM swapping, a complex form of mobile phone fraud that is often used to steal large amounts of cryptocurrencies and other items of value from victims.</p>
<p>The Justice Department says Hared was better known to his co-conspirators as &#8220;<strong>winblo</strong>.&#8221; That nickname corresponds to an extremely active and at one time revered member of the forum <strong>ogusers[.]com</strong>, a marketplace for people who wish to sell highly prized social media account names &#8212; including short usernames at Twitter, Instagram and other sites <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/talktalk-script-kids-the-quest-for-og/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that can fetch thousands of dollars apiece</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_46468" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/winblo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46468" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-46468" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/winblo.png" alt="" width="593" height="281" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-46468" class="wp-caption-text">Winblo&#8217;s account on ogusers[.]com</p></div>Winblo was an associate and business partner of another top Oguser member, a serial SIM swapper known to Oguser members as &#8220;<strong>Xzavyer</strong>.&#8221; In August 2018, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/08/alleged-sim-swapper-arrested-in-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorities in California arrested a hacker by the same name</a> &#8212; whose real name is <strong>Xzavyer Clemente Narvaez </strong>&#8212; charging him with identity theft, grand theft, and computer intrusion.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege Narvaez used the proceeds of his crimes (estimated at &gt; $1 million in virtual currencies) to purchase luxury items, including <a href="https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/2018-McLaren-570S-Price-c27201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a McLaren</a> — a $200,000 high-performance sports car.</p>
<p>According to the indictments against Hared and Ditman, one of the men (the indictment doesn&#8217;t specify which) allegedly used his ill-gotten gains to purchase a BMW i8, an automobile that sells for about $150,000.</p>
<p>Investigators also say the two men stole approximately 40 bitcoins from their SIM swapping victims. That&#8217;s roughly $136,000 in today&#8217;s conversion, but it would have been substantially more in 2017 when the price of a single bitcoin reached nearly $20,000.</p>
<p>Interestingly, KrebsOnSecurity was contacted in 2018 by a California man who said he was SIM swapped by Winblo and several associates. That victim, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals, said his Verizon mobile number was SIM hijacked by Winblo and others who used that access to take over his Twitter and PayPal accounts and then demand payment for the return of the accounts.</p>
<p>A computer specialist by trade, the victim said he was targeted because he&#8217;d invested in a cryptocurrency startup, and that the hackers found his contact information from a list of investors they&#8217;d somehow obtained. As luck would have it, he didn&#8217;t have much of value to steal in his accounts.</p>
<p>The victim said he learned more about his tormentors and exactly how they&#8217;d taken over his mobile number after they invited him to an online chat to negotiate a price for the return of his accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;They told me they had called a Verizon employee line [posing as a Verizon employee] and managed to get my Verizon account ID number,&#8221; said my victim source. &#8220;Once they had that, they called Verizon customer service and had them reset the password. They literally just called and pretended to be me, and were able to get my account tied to another SIM card.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victim said his attackers even called his mom because the mobile account was in her name. Soon after that, his phone went dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funny thing was, after I got my account back the next day, there was a voicemail from a Verizon customer service agent who said something like, &#8216;Hey [omitted], heard you were having trouble with your line, hope the new SIM card is working okay, give us a call if not, have a nice day.'&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/more-alleged-sim-swappers-face-justice/#more-46464" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
