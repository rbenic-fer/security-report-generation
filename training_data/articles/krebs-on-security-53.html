												<p>A recent consumer <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/equifax-data-breach-cellphone-survey.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> suggests that half of all Americans still haven&#8217;t checked their credit report since <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=equifax+breach&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Equifax breach</a> last year exposed the Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses and other personal information on nearly 150 million people. If you&#8217;re in that fifty percent, please make an effort to remedy that soon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-42918" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/creditreport.png" alt="" width="595" height="195" /></p>
<p>Credit reports from the three major bureaus &#8212; <strong>Equifax</strong>, <strong>Experian</strong> and <strong>TransUnion</strong> &#8212; can be obtained online for free at <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annualcreditreport.com</a> &#8212; the only Web site mandated by Congress to serve each American a free credit report every year.</p>
<p>Annualcreditreport.com is run by <a href="http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;directionType=Initial&amp;searchNameOrder=CENTRALSOURCE%20M040000050480&amp;aggregateId=forl-m04000005048-aa2368e0-cd2b-495e-bc73-cc150edebacf&amp;searchTerm=central%20source%20llc&amp;listNameOrder=CENTRALSOURCE%20M040000050480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Florida-based company</a>, but its data is supplied by the major credit bureaus, which struggled mightily to meet consumer demand for free credit reports in the immediate aftermath of the Equifax breach. Personally, I was unable to order a credit report for either me or my wife even two weeks after the Equifax breach went public: The site just kept returning errors and telling us to request the reports in writing via the U.S. Mail.</p>
<p>Based on thousands of comments left here in the days following the Equifax breach disclosure, I suspect many readers experienced the same but forgot to come back and try again. If this describes you, please take a moment this week to order your report(s) (and perhaps your spouse&#8217;s) and see if anything looks amiss. If you spot an error or something suspicious, contact the bureau that produced the report to correct the record immediately.</p>
<p>Of course, keeping on top of your credit report requires discipline, and if you&#8217;re not taking advantage of all three free reports each year you need to get a plan. My strategy is to put a reminder on our calendar to order a new report every four months or so, each time from a different credit bureau. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/checked-your-credit-since-the-equifax-hack/#more-42689" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>How good are you at telling the difference between domain names you know and trust and impostor or look-alike domains? The answer may depend on how familiar you are with the nuances of <strong>internationalized domain names</strong> (IDNs), as well as which browser or Web application you&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>For example, how does your browser interpret the following domain? I&#8217;ll give you a hint: Despite appearances, it is most certainly <strong><em>not</em></strong> the actual domain for software firm <strong>CA Technologies</strong> (formerly <strong>Computer Associates Intl Inc.</strong>), which owns the original ca.com domain name:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.са.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.са.com/</a></p>
<p>Go ahead and click on the link above or cut-and-paste it into a browser address bar. If you&#8217;re using <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, <strong>Apple&#8217;s Safari</strong>, or some recent version of <strong>Microsoft</strong>&#8216;s <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> or <strong>Edge browsers</strong>, you should notice that the address converts to &#8220;<strong>xn--80a7a.com</strong>.&#8221; This is called &#8220;punycode,&#8221; and it allows browsers to render domains with non-Latin alphabets like Cyrillic and Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Below is what it looks like in Edge on <strong>Windows 10</strong>;<strong> </strong>Google Chrome renders it much the same way. Notice what&#8217;s in the address bar (ignore the &#8220;fake site&#8221; and &#8220;Welcome to&#8230;&#8221; text, which was added as a courtesy by the person who registered this domain):</p>
<div id="attachment_42894" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/edgewin10-arrow.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42894" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-42894" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/edgewin10-arrow.png" alt="" width="598" height="64" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-42894" class="wp-caption-text">The domain https://www.са.com/ as rendered by Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. The rest of the text in the image (beginning with “Welcome to a site…”) was added by the person who registered this test domain, not the browser.</p></div>
<p>IE, Edge, Chrome and Safari all will convert https://www.са.com/ into its punycode output (xn--80a7a.com), in part to warn visitors about any confusion over look-alike domains registered in other languages. But if you load that domain in <strong>Mozilla Firefox </strong>and look at the address bar, you&#8217;ll notice there&#8217;s no warning of possible danger ahead. It just looks like it&#8217;s loading the real ca.com:</p>
<div id="attachment_42856" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fakeCAmozilla.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42856" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-42856" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fakeCAmozilla.png" alt="" width="595" height="142" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-42856" class="wp-caption-text">What the fake ca.com domain looks like when loaded in Mozilla Firefox. A browser certificate ordered from Comodo allows it to include the green lock (https://) in the address bar, adding legitimacy to the look-alike domain. The rest of the text in the image (beginning with &#8220;Welcome to a site&#8230;&#8221;) was added by the person who registered this test domain, not the browser. Click to enlarge.</p></div>
<p>The domain &#8220;xn--80a7a.com&#8221; pictured in the first screenshot above is punycode for the Ukrainian letters for &#8220;s&#8221; (which is represented by the character &#8220;c&#8221; in Russian and Ukrainian), as well as an identical Ukrainian &#8220;a&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was registered by <strong>Alex Holden, </strong>founder of Milwaukee, Wis.-based <strong>Hold Security Inc.</strong> Holden&#8217;s been experimenting with how the different browsers handle punycodes in the browser and via email. Holden grew up in what was then the Soviet Union and speaks both Russian and Ukrainian, and he&#8217;s been playing with Cyrillic letters to spell English words in domain names.</p>
<p>Letters like A and O look exactly the same and the only difference is their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unicode value</a>. There are more than <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">136,000 Unicode characters</a> used to represent letters and symbols in 139 modern and historic scripts, so there&#8217;s a ton of room for look-alike or malicious/fake domains.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;a&#8221; in Latin is the Unicode value &#8220;0061&#8221; and in Cyrillic is &#8220;0430.&#8221;  To a human, the graphical representation for both looks the same, but for a computer there is a huge difference. Internationalized domain names (IDNs) allow domain names to be registered in non-Latin letters (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 3492</a>), provided the domain is all in the same language; trying to mix two different IDNs in the same name causes the domain registries to reject the registration attempt.</p>
<p>So, in the Cyrillic alphabet (Russian/Ukrainian), we can spell АТТ, УАНОО, ХВОХ, and so on. As you can imagine, the potential opportunity for impersonation and abuse are great with IDNs.

												<p>A large number of banks, credit unions and other financial institutions just pushed customers onto new e-banking platforms that asked them to reset their account passwords by entering a username plus some other static identifier &#8212; such as the first six digits of their Social Security number (SSN), or a mix of partial SSN, date of birth and surname. Here&#8217;s a closer look at what may be going on (spoiler: small, regional banks and credit unions have grown far too reliant on the whims of just a few major online banking platform providers).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-42839" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/moneywave.png" alt="" width="594" height="341" /></p>
<p>You might think it odd that any self-respecting financial institution would seek to authenticate customers via static data like partial SSN for passwords, and you&#8217;d be completely justified for thinking that, too. Nobody has any business using these static identifiers for authentication because they are for sale on most Americans quite cheaply in the cybercrime underground. The <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=equifax+breach&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equifax breach</a> might have &#8220;refreshed&#8221; some of those data stores for identity thieves, but most U.S. adults have had their static details (DOB/SSN/MMN, address, previous address, etc) on sale for years now.</p>
<p>On Feb. 16, KrebsOnSecurity reader <strong>Brent Hoeft</strong> shared a copy of an email he&#8217;d just received from his financial institution <strong>Associated Bank</strong>, which at $30+ billion in assets happens to be Wisconsin&#8217;s largest by asset size.</p>
<p>The notice advised:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Please read and save this information (including the password below) to prepare for your online and mobile <span class="il">banking</span> upgrade.</p>
<p>Our refreshed online and mobile <span class="il">banking</span> experience is officially launching on Monday, February 26, 2018.</p>
<p>We’re excited to share it with you, and want you to be aware of some important details about the transition.</p>
<p>TEMPORARY PASSWORD</p>
<p>Use this temporary password the first time you sign in after the upgrade. Your temporary password is the first four letters of your last name plus the last four digits of your Social Security Number.</p>
<p>XXXX#### [redacted by me but included in the email]</p>
<p>Note: your password is all lowercase without spaces.</p>
<p>Once the upgrade is complete, you will need your temporary password to begin the re-enrollment process.<br />
• Beginning Monday, February 26, you will need to sign in using your existing user ID and the temporary password included above in this email. Please note that you are only required to reenroll in online or mobile <span class="il">banking</span> but can access both using the same user ID and password.<br />
• Once you sign in, you will be prompted to create a new password and establish other security features. Your user ID will remain the same.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hoeft said Associated Bank seems to treat the customer username as a secret, something to be protected along with the password.</p>
<p>&#8220;I contacted Associated&#8217;s customer service via email and received a far less satisfying explanation that the user name is required for re-activation and, that since [the username] was not provided in the email, the process they are using is in fact secure,&#8221; Hoeft said.</p>
<p>After speaking with Hoeft, I <a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/964538799962361856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted about</a> whether to name and shame the bank before it was too late, or perhaps to try and talk some sense into them privately. Most readers advised that calling attention to the problem before the transition could cause more harm than good, and that at least until after Feb. 26 contacting some of the banks privately was the best idea (which is what I did).</p>
<p>Associated Bank wouldn&#8217;t say who their new consumer online banking platform provider was, but they did say it was one of the big ones. I took that to mean either <strong><a href="https://www.fisglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIS</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiserv</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.jackhenry.com/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Henry</a></strong>, which collectively control approximately 70 percent of the market for bank core processors (according to <a href="https://www.fedfis.com/uploads/8/4/8/8/84888518/bank_core_market_share_2017.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FedFIS.com</a>, Fiserv is by far the largest).</p>
<div id="attachment_42823" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42823" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-42823" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/coreprocessor.png" alt="" width="584" height="396" /><p id="caption-attachment-42823" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Fedfis.com</p></div>
<p>The bank&#8217;s chief information security officer <strong>Joe Smits</strong> said Associated&#8217;s new consumer online banking platform provider required that new and existing customers log in with a username and a temporary password &#8212; which was described as choice among secondary, static data elements about customers &#8212; such as the first six digits of the customer&#8217;s SSN or date of birth.</p>
<p>Smits added that the bank originally started emailing customers the instructions for figuring out their temporary passwords, but then decided US mail would be a safer option and sent the rest out that way. He said only about 15 percent of Associated Bank customers (~50,000) received instructions about their temporary passwords through email.</p>
<p>I followed up with Hoeft to find out how his online banking upgrade went at Associated Bank. He told me that upon visiting the site, it asked for his username and the temporary password (the first four letters of his last name and the last four digits of his SSN).</p>
<p>&#8220;After entering that I was told to re-enter my temporary password and then create a new password,&#8221; Hoeft said. &#8220;I then was asked to select 5 security questions and provide answers. Next I was asked for a verification phone number. Upon entering that I received a text message with a 4 digit verification code. After entering the code it asked me to finish my profile information including name, email and daytime phone. After that it took me right into my online banking account.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoeft said it seems like the &#8220;verification&#8221; step that was supposed to create an extra security check didn&#8217;t really add any security at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;If someone were able to get in with the temporary password, they would be able to create a new password, fill out all the security code information, and then provide their phone number to receive the verification code,&#8221; Hoeft said. &#8220;Armed with the verification code they then would be able to get right into my online banking account.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/what-is-your-banks-security-banking-on/#more-42687" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Attackers have seized on a relatively new method for executing <strong>distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</strong> of unprecedented disruptive power, using it to launch record-breaking DDoS assaults over the past week. Now evidence suggests this novel attack method is fueling digital shakedowns in which victims are asked to pay a ransom to call off crippling cyberattacks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-36825" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ddosbomb.png" alt="" width="592" height="364" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ddosbomb.png 699w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ddosbomb-580x357.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></p>
<p>On March 1, DDoS mitigation firm <strong>Akamai</strong> <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/03/memcached-fueled-13-tbps-attacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that one of its clients was hit with a DDoS attack that clocked in at 1.3 Tbps, which would make it the largest publicly recorded DDoS attack ever.</p>
<p>The type of DDoS method used in this record-breaking attack abuses a legitimate and relatively common service called &#8220;memcached&#8221; (pronounced &#8220;mem-cash-dee&#8221;) to massively amp up the power of their DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>Installed by default on many <strong>Linux</strong> operating system versions, memcached is designed to cache data and ease the strain on heavier data stores, like disk or databases. It is typically found in cloud server environments and it is meant to be used on systems that are not directly exposed to the Internet.</p>
<p>Memcached communicates using the User Datagram Protocol or UDP, which allows communications without any authentication &#8212; pretty much anyone or anything can talk to it and request data from it.</p>
<p>Because memcached doesn&#8217;t support authentication, an attacker can &#8220;spoof&#8221; or fake the Internet address of the machine making that request so that the memcached servers responding to the request all respond to the spoofed address &#8212; the intended target of the DDoS attack.</p>
<p>Worse yet, memcached has a unique ability to take a small amount of attack traffic and amplify it into a much bigger threat. Most popular DDoS tactics that abuse UDP connections can amplify the attack traffic 10 or 20 times &#8212; allowing, for example a 1 mb file request to generate a response that includes between 10mb and 20mb of traffic.</p>
<p>But with memcached, an attacker can force the response to be thousands of times the size of the request. All of the responses get sent to the target specified in the spoofed request, and it requires only a small number of open memcached servers to create huge attacks using very few resources.</p>
<p>Akamai believes there are currently more than 50,000 known memcached systems exposed to the Internet that can be leveraged at a moment&#8217;s notice to aid in massive DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2018/02/memcached-udp-reflection-attacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akamai</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@qratorlabs/the-memcached-amplification-attack-reaching-500-gbps-b439a7b83c98" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qrator</a> &#8212; a Russian DDoS mitigation company &#8212; published blog posts on Feb. 28 warning of the increased threat from memcached attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This attack was the largest attack seen to date by Akamai, more than twice the size of the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/11/akamai-on-the-record-krebsonsecurity-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September, 2016 attacks that announced the Mirai botnet </a>and possibly the largest DDoS attack publicly disclosed,&#8221; Akamai said [link added]. &#8220;Because of memcached reflection capabilities, it is highly likely that this record attack will not be the biggest for long.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Qrator, this specific possibility of enabling high-value DDoS attacks was <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1zkep0_EJvRAsTA5mMn0HKi8L5lTYTJsN/view?usp=drive_web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-href="https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1zkep0_EJvRAsTA5mMn0HKi8L5lTYTJsN/view?usp=drive_web" data-ss1520013592="1">disclosed in 2017</a> by a Chinese group of researchers from the cybersecurity <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://0kee.360.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-href="https://0kee.360.cn" data-ss1520013592="1">0Kee Team</a>. The larger concept was first introduced in a 2014 <strong>Black Hat</strong> U.S. security conference talk titled “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Novikov-The-New-Page-Of-Injections-Book-Memcached-Injections-WP.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Novikov-The-New-Page-Of-Injections-Book-Memcached-Injections-WP.pdf" data-ss1520013592="1">Memcached injections.&#8221;</a></p>
<h4>DDOS VIA RANSOM DEMAND</h4>
<p>On Thursday, KrebsOnSecurity heard from several experts from <strong>Cybereason</strong>, a Boston-based security company that&#8217;s been closely tracking these memcached attacks. Cybereason said its analysis reveals the attackers are embedding a short ransom note and payment address into the junk traffic they&#8217;re sending to memcached services.</p>
<p>Cybereason said it has seen memcached attack payloads that consist of little more than a simple ransom note requesting payment of 50 XMR (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero_(cryptocurrency)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero virtual currency</a>) to be sent to a specific Monero account. In these attacks, Cybereason found, the payment request gets repeated until the file reaches approximately one megabyte in size.</p>
<div id="attachment_42786" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ddosdemand.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42786" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-42786 " src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ddosdemand.png" alt="" width="598" height="242" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-42786" class="wp-caption-text">The ransom demand (50 Monero) found in the memcached attacks by Cybereason on Thursday.</p></div>
<p>Memcached can accept files and host files in temporary memory for download by others. So the attackers will place the 1 mb file full of ransom requests onto a server with memcached, and request that file thousands of times &#8212; all the while telling the service that the replies should all go to the same Internet address &#8212; the address of the attack&#8217;s target.</p>
<p>&#8220;The payload is the ransom demand itself, over and over again for about a megabyte of data,&#8221; said <strong>Matt Ploessel</strong>, principal security intelligence researcher at Cybereason. &#8220;We then request the memcached ransom payload over and over, and from multiple memcached servers to produce an extremely high volume DDoS with a simple script and any normal home office Internet connection. We&#8217;re observing people putting up those ransom payloads and DDoSsing people with them.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/powerful-new-ddos-method-adds-extortion/#more-42782" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The <strong>Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center</strong> (FS-ISAC), an industry forum for sharing data about critical cybersecurity threats facing the banking and finance industries, said today that a successful phishing attack on one of its employees was used to launch additional phishing attacks against FS-ISAC members.</p>
<p>The fallout from the back-to-back phishing attacks appears to have been limited and contained, as many FS-ISAC members who received the phishing attack quickly detected and reported it as suspicious. But the incident is a good reminder to be on your guard, remember that anyone can get phished, and that most phishing attacks succeed by abusing the sense of trust already established between the sender and recipient.</p>
<div id="attachment_42771" style="width: 457px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42771" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-42771" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fs-isacphish.png" alt="" width="447" height="502" /><p id="caption-attachment-42771" class="wp-caption-text">The confidential alert FS-ISAC sent to members about a successful phishing attack that spawned phishing emails coming from the FS-ISAC.</p></div>
<p>Notice of the phishing incident came in an alert FS-ISAC shared with its members today and obtained by KrebsOnSecurity. It describes an incident on Feb. 28 in which an FS-ISAC employee &#8220;clicked on a phishing email, compromising that employee&#8217;s login credentials. Using the credentials, a threat actor created an email with a PDF that had a link to a credential harvesting site and was then sent from the employee&#8217;s email account to select members, affiliates and employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alert said while FS-ISAC was already planning and implementing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution across all of its email platforms, &#8220;unfortunately, this incident happened to an employee that was not yet set up for MFA. We are accelerating our MFA solution across all FS-ISAC assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FS-ISAC also said it upgraded its Office 365 email version to provide &#8220;additional visibility and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, FS-ISAC President and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-nelson-6b4b174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Nelson</a> said his organization has grown significantly in new staff over the past few years to more than 75 people now, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregtemm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Temm</a>, the FS-ISAC&#8217;s chief information risk officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say I&#8217;m disappointed this got through is an understatement,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;We need to accelerate MFA extremely quickly for all of our assets.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/financial-cyber-threat-sharing-group-phished/#more-42766" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>T-Mobile</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> and other mobile carriers are reminding customers to take advantage of free services that can block identity thieves from easily &#8220;porting&#8221; your mobile number out to another provider, which allows crooks to intercept your calls and messages while your phone goes dark. Tips for minimizing the risk of number porting fraud are available below for customers of all four major mobile providers, including <strong>Sprint</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42753" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobileportoutscams.png" alt="" width="564" height="275" /></p>
<p>Unauthorized mobile phone number porting is not a new problem, but T-Mobile said it <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/customers/secure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began alerting customers about it</a> earlier this month because the company has seen a recent uptick in fraudulent requests to have customer phone numbers ported over to another mobile provider&#8217;s network.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have been alerting customers via SMS that our industry is experiencing a phone number port out scam that could impact them,&#8221; T-Mobile said in a written statement. &#8220;We have been encouraging them to add a port validation feature, if they’ve not already done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crooks typically use phony number porting requests when they have already stolen the password for a customer account (either for the mobile provider&#8217;s network or for another site), and wish to intercept the one-time password that many companies send to the mobile device to perform two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>Porting a number to a new provider shuts off the phone of the original user, and forwards all calls to the new device. Once in control of the mobile number, thieves can request any second factor that is sent to the newly activated device, such as a one-time code sent via text message or or an automated call that reads the one-time code aloud.</p>
<p>In these cases, the fraudsters can call a customer service specialist at a mobile provider and pose as the target, providing the mark&#8217;s static identifiers like name, date of birth, social security number and other information. Often this is enough to have a target&#8217;s calls temporarily forwarded to another number, or ported to a different provider&#8217;s network.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="pullquote pqright">Port out fraud has been an industry problem for a long time, but recently we’ve seen an uptick in this illegal activity,&#8221; T-Mobile said. </span> &#8220;We’re not providing specific metrics, but it’s been enough that we felt it was important to encourage customers to add extra security features to their accounts.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <a href="http://about.att.com/sites/cybersecurity/ni/blog/porting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post published Tuesday</a>, AT&amp;T said bad guys sometimes use illegal porting to steal your phone number, transfer the number to a device they control and intercept text authentication messages from your bank, credit card issuer or other companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may not know this has happened until you notice your mobile device has lost service,&#8221; reads a post by <strong>Brian Rexroad</strong>, VP of security relations at AT&amp;T. &#8220;Then, you may notice loss of access to important accounts as the attacker changes passwords, steals your money, and gains access to other pieces of your personal information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rexroad says in some cases the thieves just walk into an AT&amp;T store and present a fake ID and your personal information, requesting to switch carriers. Porting allows customers to take their phone number with them when they change phone carriers.</p>
<p>The law requires carriers to provide this number porting feature, but there are ways to reduce the risk of this happening to you. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/how-to-fight-mobile-number-port-out-scams/#more-42655" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks in cybercrime news, justifying updates to a couple of cases we&#8217;ve been following closely at KrebsOnSecurity. In Ukraine, the alleged ringleader of the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/12/avalanche-global-fraud-ring-dismantled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Avalanche</strong> malware spam botnet</a> was arrested after eluding authorities in the wake of a global cybercrime crackdown there in 2016. Separately, a case that was hailed as a test of whether programmers can be held accountable for how customers use their product turned out poorly for 27-year-old programmer <strong>Taylor Huddleston</strong>, who was sentenced to almost three years in prison for making and marketing a complex spyware program.</p>
<p>First, the Ukrainian case. On Nov. 30, 2016, authorities across Europe <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/12/avalanche-global-fraud-ring-dismantled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated the arrest of five individuals</a> thought to be tied to the Avalanche crime gang, in an operation that the FBI and its partners abroad described as an unprecedented global law enforcement response to cybercrime. Hundreds of malicious web servers and hundreds of thousands of domains were blocked in the coordinated action.</p>
<div id="attachment_37133" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/avalanchemap.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37133" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-37133" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/avalanchemap.png" alt="" width="599" height="365" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/avalanchemap.png 1335w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/avalanchemap-580x354.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/avalanchemap-768x468.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/avalanchemap-940x573.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-37133" class="wp-caption-text">The global distribution of servers used in the Avalanche crime machine.

<p>The alleged leader of the Avalanche gang — 33-year-old Russian <strong>Gennady Kapkanov</strong> — did not go quietly at the time. Kapkanov allegedly shot at officers with a Kalashnikov assault rifle through the front door as they prepared to raid his home, and then attempted to escape off of his 4th floor apartment balcony. He was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/12/avalanche-crime-ring-leader-eludes-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later released, after police allegedly failed to file proper arrest records for him</a>.</p>
<p>But on Monday <em>Agence France-Presse</em> (AFP) <a href="https://ph.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-arrests-avalanche-cybercrime-organiser-police-102908616.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Ukrainian authorities had once again collared Kapkanov, who was allegedly living under a phony passport in Poltav, a city in central Ukraine. No word yet on whether Kapkanov has been charged, which was supposed to happen Monday.</p>

<h4>HOW WELL DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS?</h4>
<p>Lawyers for Taylor Huddleston, a 27-year-old programmer from Hot Springs, Ark., originally asked a federal court to believe that the software he sold on the sprawling hacker marketplace <strong>Hackforums</strong> &#8212; a &#8220;remote administration tool&#8221; or &#8220;RAT&#8221; designed to let someone remotely administer one or many computers remotely &#8212; was just a benign tool.</p>
<p>The bad things done with Mr. Huddleston&#8217;s tools, the defendant argued, were not Mr. Huddleston&#8217;s doing. Furthermore, no one had accused Mr. Huddleston of even using his own software.</p>
<p><em>The Daily Beast</em> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-arrests-hacker-who-hacked-no-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first wrote about Huddleston&#8217;s case in 2017</a>, and at the time suggested <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6294319/united-states-v-huddleston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his prosecution</a> raised questions of whether a programmer could be held criminally responsible for the actions of his users. My response to that piece was &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/04/dual-use-software-criminal-case-not-so-novel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dual-Use Software Criminal Case Not So Novel.</a>&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_38879" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38879" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-38879" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/huddlestoncuff.png" alt="" width="250" height="253" /><p id="caption-attachment-38879" class="wp-caption-text">Photo illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast</p></div>
<p>The court was swayed by evidence that <em>yes</em>, Mr. Huddleston <em>could</em> be held criminally responsible for those actions. It sentenced him to 33 months in prison after the defendant acknowledged that he knew his RAT &#8212; a Remote Access Trojan dubbed &#8220;<strong>NanoCore RAT</strong>&#8221; &#8212; was being used to spy on webcams and steal passwords from systems running the software.</p>
<p>Of course Huddleston knew: He didn&#8217;t market his wares on some Craigslist software marketplace ad, or via video promos on his local cable channel: He marketed the NanoCore RAT and another software licensing program called <strong>Net Seal</strong> exclusively on <strong>Hackforums[dot]net. </strong></p>
<p>This sprawling, English language forum has <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=hackforums&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deep bench of technical forum discussions</a> about using RATs and other tools to surreptitiously record passwords and videos of &#8220;slaves,&#8221; the derisive term for systems secretly infected with these RATs.</p>
<p>Huddleston knew what many of his customers were doing because many NanoCore users also used Huddleston&#8217;s Net Seal program to keep their own RATs and other custom hacking tools from being disassembled or &#8220;cracked&#8221; and posted online for free. In short: He knew what programs his customers were using Net Seal on, and he knew what those customers had done or intended to do with tools like NanoCore.</p>
<p>The sentencing suggests that where you choose to sell something online says a lot about what you think of your own product and who&#8217;s likely buying it.</p>
<p>Daily Beast author <strong>Kevin Poulsen</strong> noted in <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/nanocore-coder-pleads-guilty-to-aiding-and-abetting-hackers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a July 2017 story</a> that Huddleston changed his tune and pleaded guilty. The story pointed to an <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href="http://www.kingpin.cc/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/vaed-1.17-cr-00034-28.pdf" rel="noreferrer" data-ss1519740165="1">accompanying</a> plea in which Huddleston stipulated that he “knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted thousands of unlawful computer intrusions” in selling the program to hackers and that he “acted with the purpose of furthering these unauthorized computer intrusions and causing them to occur.” <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/bot-roundup-avalanche-kronos-nanocore/#more-42714" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In October 2017, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> that ne&#8217;er-do-wells could take advantage of a relatively new service offered by the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> that provides scanned images of all incoming mail before it is slated to arrive at its destination address. We advised that stalkers or scammers could abuse this service by signing up as anyone in the household, because the USPS wasn&#8217;t at that point set up to use its own unique communication system &#8212; the U.S. mail &#8212; to alert residents when someone had signed up to receive these scanned images.</p>
<div id="attachment_40983" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40983" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-40983" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/informeddelivery.png" alt="" width="600" height="259" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/informeddelivery.png 818w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/informeddelivery-580x250.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/informeddelivery-768x331.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-40983" class="wp-caption-text">Image: USPS</p></div>
<p>The USPS recently told this publication that beginning Feb. 16 it started alerting all households by mail whenever anyone signs up to receive these scanned notifications of mail delivered to that address. The notification program, dubbed &#8220;<strong>Informed Delivery</strong>,&#8221; includes a scan of the front of each envelope destined for a specific address each day.</p>
<p>The Postal Service says consumer feedback on its Informed Delivery service has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly among residents who travel regularly and wish to keep close tabs on any bills or other mail being delivered while they’re on the road. It has been available to select addresses in several states since 2014 under a targeted USPS pilot program, but it has since expanded to include many ZIP codes nationwide. U.S. residents can find out if their address is eligible by visiting <a href="https://informeddelivery.usps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">informeddelivery.usps.com</a>.</p>
<p>According to the USPS, some 8.1 million accounts have been created via the service so far (Oct. 7, 2017, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last time I wrote about Informed Delivery</a>, there were 6.3 million subscribers, so the program has grown more than 28 percent in five months).</p>
<p><strong>Roy Betts</strong>, a spokesperson for the USPS&#8217;s communications team, says post offices handled 50,000 Informed Delivery notifications the week of Feb. 16, and are delivering an additional 100,000 letters to existing Informed Delivery addresses this coming week.</p>
<p>Currently, the USPS allows address changes via the USPS Web site or in-person at any one of more than 35,000 USPS retail locations nationwide. When a request is processed, the USPS sends a confirmation letter to both the old address and the new address.</p>
<p>If someone already signed up for Informed Delivery later posts a change of address request, the USPS does not automatically transfer the Informed Delivery service to the new address: Rather, it sends a mailer with a special code tied to the new address and to the username that requested the change. To resume Informed Delivery at the new address, that code needs to be entered online using the account that requested the address change.</p>
<p>A review of the methods used by the USPS to validate new account signups last fall suggested the service was wide open to abuse by a range of parties, mainly because of weak authentication and because it is not easy to opt out of the service.</p>
<p>Signing up requires an eligible resident <a href="https://reg.usps.com/entreg/RegistrationPortalAction_input" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to create a free user account</a> at USPS.com, which asks for the resident’s name, address and an email address. The final step in validating residents involves answering four so-called “knowledge-based authentication” or KBA questions.</p>
<p>The USPS told me it uses two ID proofing vendors: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/03/who-built-the-id-theft-service-ssndob-ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lexis Nexis</a><strong>; </strong>and, naturally, recently breached big three credit bureau <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=Equifax&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equifax</a> — to ask the magic KBA questions, rotating between them randomly.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=kba&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assailed KBA</a> as an unreliable authentication method because so many answers to the multiple-guess questions are available on sites like <strong>Spokeo</strong> and <strong>Zillow</strong>, or via social networking profiles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also nice when Equifax gives away a metric truckload of information about where you&#8217;ve worked, how much you made at each job, and what addresses you frequented when. See: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/how-to-opt-out-of-equifax-revealing-your-salary-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Opt Out of Equifax Revealing Your Salary History</a> for how much leaks from this lucrative division of Equifax. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/usps-finally-starts-notifying-you-by-mail-if-someone-is-scanning-your-snail-mail-online/#more-42450" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multiple <strong>Chase.com</strong> customers have reported logging in to their bank accounts, only to be presented with another customer&#8217;s bank account details. Chase has acknowledged the incident, saying it was caused by an internal &#8220;glitch&#8221; Wednesday evening that did not involve any kind of hacking attempt or cyber attack.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32822" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jpmchase.png" alt="" width="582" height="291" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jpmchase.png 582w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jpmchase-580x290.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Trish Wexler</strong>, director of communications for the retail side of <strong>JP Morgan Chase</strong>, said the incident happened Wednesday evening, for &#8220;a pretty limited number of customers&#8221; between 6:30 pm  and 9 pm ET who &#8220;sporadically during that time while logged in to chase.com could see someone else’s account details.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We know for sure the glitch was on our end, not from a malicious actor,&#8221; Wexler said, noting that Chase is still trying to determine how many customers may have been affected. &#8220;We&#8217;re going through Tweets from customers and making sure that if anyone is calling us with issues we&#8217;re working one on one with customers. If you see suspicious activity you should give us a call.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wexler urged customers to &#8220;practice good security hygiene&#8221; by regularly reviewing their account statements, and promptly reporting any discrepancies. She said Chase is still working to determine the precise cause of the mix-up, and that there have been no reports of JPMC commercial customers seeing the account information of other customers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;This was all on our side,&#8221; Wexler said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what did happen yet but I know what didn&#8217;t happen. What happened last night was 100 percent not the result of anything malicious.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The account mix-up was documented on Wednesday by <a href="http://flyanddine.boardingarea.com/chase-glitch-random-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fly &amp; Dine</a>, an online publication that chronicles the airline food industry. Fly &amp; Dine included screenshots of one of their writer&#8217;s spouses logged into the account of a fellow Chase customer with an Amazon and Chase card and a balance of more than $16,000.</span> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/chase-glitch-exposed-customer-accounts/#more-42659" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Patrick Reames</strong> had no idea why <strong>Amazon.com</strong> sent him a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1099 form</a> saying he&#8217;d made almost $24,000 selling books via <strong>Createspace</strong>, the company&#8217;s on-demand publishing arm. That is, until he searched the site for his name and discovered someone has been using it to peddle a $555 book that&#8217;s full of nothing but gibberish.</p>

<p>But that didn&#8217;t stop someone from publishing a &#8220;novel&#8221; under his name. That word is in quotations because the publication appears to be little more than computer-generated text, almost like the gibberish one might find in a spam email.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on what I could see from the &#8216;sneak peak&#8217; function, the book was nothing more than a computer generated &#8216;story&#8217; with no structure, chapters or paragraphs &#8212; only lines of text with a carriage return after each sentence,&#8221; Reames said in an interview with KrebsOnSecurity.</p>
<p>The impersonator priced the book at $555 and it was posted to multiple Amazon sites in different countries. The book &#8212; which as been removed from most Amazon country pages as of a few days ago &#8212; is titled &#8220;Lower Days Ahead,&#8221; and was published on Oct 7, 2017.</p>
<p>Reames said he suspects someone has been buying the book using stolen credit and/or debit cards, and pocketing the 60 percent that Amazon gives to authors. At $555 a pop, it would only take approximately 70 sales over three months to rack up the earnings that Amazon said he made.</p>
<p>&#8220;This book is very unlikely to ever sell on its own, much less sell enough copies in 12 weeks to generate that level of revenue,&#8221; Reames said. &#8220;As such, I assume it was used for money laundering, in addition to tax fraud/evasion by using my Social Security number. Amazon refuses to issue a corrected 1099 or provide me with any information I can use to determine where or how they were remitting the royalties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reames said the books he has sold on Amazon under his name were done through his publisher, not directly via a personal account (the royalties for those books accrue to his former employer) so he&#8217;d never given Amazon his Social Security number. But the fraudster evidently had, and that was apparently enough to convince Amazon that the imposter was him.</p>
<p>Reames said after learning of the impersonation, he got curious enough to start looking for other examples of author oddities on Amazon&#8217;s Createspace platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have reviewed numerous Createspace titles and its clear to me that there may be hundreds if not thousands of similar fraudulent books on their site,&#8221; Reames said. &#8220;These books contain no real content, only dozens of pages of gibberish or computer generated text.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/money-laundering-via-author-impersonation-on-amazon/#more-42584" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
