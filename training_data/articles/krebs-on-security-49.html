												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today pushed out a bevy of software updates to fix more than four dozen security holes in <strong>Windows</strong> and related software. Almost a quarter of the vulnerabilities addressed in this month&#8217;s patch batch earned Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;critical&#8221; rating, meaning malware or miscreants can exploit the flaws to break into vulnerable systems without any help from users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="" width="229" height="240" />Most of the critical fixes are in Microsoft browsers or browser components. One of the flaws, <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8267</a>, was publicly disclosed prior to today&#8217;s patch release, meaning attackers may have had a head start figuring out how to exploit the bug to attack <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recorded Future</a>, the most important patched vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Domain Name System (DNS), which is present in all versions of supported versions of Windows from <strong>Windows 7</strong> to <strong>Windows 10</strong> as well as all versions of Windows Server from 2008 to 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a maliciously crafted DNS packet to the victim machine from a DNS server, or even send spoofed DNS responses from attack box,&#8221; wrote <strong>Allan Liska</strong>, a threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future. &#8220;Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to take control of the target machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security vendor <strong>Qualys</strong> <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2018/06/12/june-patch-tuesday-new-speculative-store-bypass-fixes-adobe-vulns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> mobile workstations that may connect to untrusted Wi-Fi networks are at high risk and this DNS patch should be a priority for them. Qualys also notes that Microsoft this month is shipping updates to mitigate another variant of the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/scary-chip-flaws-raise-spectre-of-meltdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spectre vulnerability</a> in Intel machines.</p>
<p>And of course there are updates available to address the <strong>Adobe Flash Player</strong> vulnerability that is already being exploited in active attacks. Read more on that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/adobe-patches-zero-day-flash-flaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/microsoft-patch-tuesday-june-2018-edition/#more-44236" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Web site names ending in new top-level domains (TLDs) like <strong>.men</strong>, <strong>.work</strong> and <strong>.click</strong> are some of the riskiest and spammy-est on the Internet, according to experts who track such concentrations of badness online. Not that there still aren&#8217;t a whole mess of nasty <strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.net</strong> and <strong>.biz</strong> domains out there, but relative to their size (i.e. overall number of domains) these newer TLDs are far dicier to visit than most online destinations.</p>
<p>There are many sources for measuring domain reputation online, but one of the newest is <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/tlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The 10 Most Abused Top Level Domains list</a>, run by <strong>Spamhaus.org</strong>. Currently at the #1 spot on the list (the worst) is .men: Spamhaus says of the 65,570 domains it has seen registered in the .men TLD, more than half (55 percent) were &#8220;bad.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44198" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/toptenabusedtlds.png" alt="" width="541" height="884" /></p>
<p>According to Spamhaus, a TLD may be &#8220;bad&#8221; because it is tied to spam or malware dissemination (or both). More specifically, the &#8220;badness&#8221; of a given TLD may be assigned in two ways:</p>
<p>&#8220;The ratio of bad to good domains may be higher than average, indicating that the registry could do a better job of enforcing policies and shunning abusers. Or, some TLDs with a high fraction of bad domains may be quite small, and their total number of bad domains could be relatively limited with respect to other, bigger TLDs. Their total &#8220;badness&#8221; to the Internet is limited by their small total size.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.icann.org/registrar-reports/accredited-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,500 TLDs exist today</a>, but hundreds of them were introduced in just the past few years. The nonprofit organization that runs the domain name space &#8212; the <strong>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</strong> (ICANN) &#8212; enabled the new TLDs in response to requests from advertisers and domain speculators &#8212; even though security experts warned that an onslaught of new, far cheaper TLDs would be a boon mainly to spammers and scammers.</p>
<p>And what a boon it has been. The newer TLDs are popular among spammers and scammers alike because domains in many of these TLDs can be had for pennies apiece. But not all of the TLDs on Spamhaus&#8217; list are prized for being cheaper than generic TLDs (like .com, .net, etc.). The cheapest domains at half of Spamhaus&#8217; top ten &#8220;baddest&#8221; TLDs go for prices between $6 and $14.50 per domain.</p>
<p>Still, domains in the remaining five Top Bad TLDs can be had for between 48 cents and a dollar each.</p>
<p>Security firm <strong>Symantec </strong>in March 2018 published its own <a href="https://www.symantec.com/blogs/feature-stories/top-20-shady-top-level-domains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 20 list of Shady TLDs:</a></p>
<div id="attachment_44194" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44194" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-44194" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sym-top20-tld.png" alt="" width="446" height="804" /><p id="caption-attachment-44194" class="wp-caption-text">Symantec&#8217;s &#8220;Top 20 Shady TLDs,&#8221; published in March 2018.</p></div>
<p>Spamhaus says TLD registries that allow registrars to sell high volumes of domains to professional spammers and malware operators in essence aid and abet the plague of abuse on the Internet.</p>
<p>“Some registrars and resellers knowingly sell high volumes of domains to these actors for profit, and many registries do not do enough to stop or limit this endless supply of domains,” Spamhaus’ World’s Most Abused TLDs page explains.</p>
<p><strong>Namecheap, </strong>a Phoenix, Ariz. based domain name registrar that in Oct. 2017 was the <a href="https://domainnamewire.com/2018/02/02/coms-top-registrars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth-largest registrar</a>, currently offers by a wide margin the lowest registration prices for three out of 10 of Spamhaus’ baddest TLDs, selling most for less than 50 cents each.</p>
<p>Namecheap also is by far the cheapest registrar for 11 of Symantec&#8217;s Top 20 Shady New TLDs: Namecheap is easily the least expensive registrar to secure a domain in 11 of the Top 20, including .date, .trade, .review, .party, .loan, .kim, .bid, .win, .racing, .download and .stream. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/bad-men-at-work-please-dont-click/#more-44137" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Adobe</strong> has released an emergency update to address a critical security hole in its <strong>Flash Player</strong> browser plugin that is being actively exploited to deploy malicious software. If you&#8217;ve got Flash installed &#8212; and if you&#8217;re using <strong>Google Chrome</strong> or a recent version of <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> you do &#8212; it&#8217;s time once again to make sure your copy of Flash is either patched, hobbled or removed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-18875" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/brokenflash-a.png" alt="" width="211" height="180" />In <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb18-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an advisory</a> published today, Adobe said it is aware of a report that an exploit for the previously unknown Flash flaw &#8212; <strong>CVE-2018-5002</strong> &#8212; exists in the wild, and &#8220;is being used in limited, targeted attacks against Windows users. These attacks leverage <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> documents with embedded malicious Flash Player content distributed via email.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vulnerable versions of Flash include <em>v. 29.0.0.171</em> and earlier. The version of Flash released today brings the program to <em>v. 30.0.0.113</em> for Windows, <strong>Mac</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>Chrome OS</strong>. Check out <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> to detect the presence of Flash in your browser and the version number installed.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>/<strong>Edge</strong> on <strong>Windows 10</strong> and Chrome should automatically prompt users to update Flash when newer versions are available. At the moment, however, I can&#8217;t see any signs yet that either Microsoft or Google has pushed out new updates to address the Flash flaw. I&#8217;ll update this post if that changes. (<strong>Update: June 8, 11:01 a.m. ET:</strong> Looks like the browser makers are starting to push this out. You may still need to restart your browser for the update to take effect.)</p>
<p>Adobe credits Chinese security firm <strong>Qihoo 360</strong> with reporting the zero-day Flash flaw. Qihoo said in <a href="http://blogs.360.cn/blog/cve-2018-5002-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a> that the exploit was seen being used to target individuals and companies in Doha, Qatar, and is believed to be related to a nation-state backed cyber-espionage campaign that uses booby-trapped Office documents to deploy malware.</p>
<p>In February 2018, Adobe <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/attackers-exploiting-unpatched-flaw-in-flash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patched another zero-day Flash flaw</a> that was <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/02/attacks-leveraging-adobe-zero-day.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tied to cyber espionage attacks launched by North Korean hackers</a>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/adobe-patches-zero-day-flash-flaw/#more-44204" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Last month&#8217;s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/when-your-employees-post-passwords-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story</a> about organizations exposing passwords and other sensitive data via collaborative online spaces at <strong>Trello.com</strong> only scratched the surface of the problem. A deeper dive suggests a large number of government agencies, marketing firms, healthcare organizations and IT support companies are publishing credentials via public Trello boards that quickly get indexed by the major search engines.</p>
<p>By default, Trello boards for both enterprise and personal use are set to either private (requires a password to view the content) or team-visible only (approved members of the collaboration team can view).</p>
<p>But individual users may be able to manually share personal boards that include personal or proprietary employer data, information that gets cataloged by Internet search engines and available to anyone with a Web browser.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-44153" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trello.png" alt="" width="593" height="205" /></p>
<p><strong>David Shear</strong> is an analyst at <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com">Flashpoint</a>, a New York City based threat intelligence company. Shear spent several weeks last month exploring the depths of sensitive data exposed on Trello. Amid his digging, Shear documented hundreds of public Trello boards that were exposing passwords and other sensitive information. KrebsOnSecurity worked with Shear to document and report these boards to Trello.</p>
<p>Shear said he&#8217;s amazed at the number of companies selling IT support services that are using Trello not only to store their own passwords, but even credentials to manage customer assets online.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a bunch of different IT shops using it to troubleshoot client requests, and to do updates to infrastructure,&#8221; Shear said. &#8220;We also found a Web development team that&#8217;s done a lot of work for various dental offices. You could see who all their clients were and see credentials for clients to log into their own sites. These are IT companies doing this. And they tracked it all via [public] Trello pages.&#8221;</p>
<p>One particularly jarring misstep came from someone working for <a href="http://www.seceon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seceon</a>, a Westford, Mass. cybersecurity firm that touts the ability to detect and stop data breaches in real time. But until a few weeks ago the Trello page for Seceon featured multiple usernames and passwords, including credentials to log in to the company&#8217;s <strong>WordPress</strong> blog and <strong>iPage</strong> domain hosting.</p>
<div id="attachment_44146" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/seceon-red.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44146" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-44146" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/seceon-red.png" alt="" width="589" height="433" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-44146" class="wp-caption-text">Credentials shared on Trello by an employee of Seceon, a cybersecurity firm.</p></div>
<p>Shear also found that a senior software engineer working for <strong>Red Hat Linux</strong> in October 2017 posted administrative credentials to two different servers apparently used to test new builds.</p>
<div id="attachment_44147" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/redhat-edited.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44147" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-44147" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/redhat-edited.png" alt="" width="593" height="320" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-44147" class="wp-caption-text">Credentials posted by a senior software engineer at Red Hat.</p></div>
<p>The <strong>Maricopa County Department of Public Health</strong> (MCDPH) in Arizona used public Trello boards to document a host of internal resources that are typically found behind corporate intranets, such as this board that aggregated information for new hires (including information about how to navigate the MCDPH&#8217;s payroll system):</p>
<div id="attachment_44148" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcdph.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44148" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-44148" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mcdph.png" alt="" width="594" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-44148" class="wp-caption-text">The (now defunct) Trello page for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health.</p></div>
<p>Even federal health regulators have made privacy missteps with Trello. Shear&#8217;s sleuthing uncovered a public Trello page maintained by <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HealthIT.gov</a> &#8212; the official Web site of the <strong>National Coordinator for Health Information Technology</strong>, a component of the <strong>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</strong> (HHS) &#8212; that was leaking credentials.</p>
<p>There appear to be a great many marketers and realtors who are using public Trello boards as their personal password notepads. One of my favorites is a Trello page maintained by a &#8220;virtual assistant&#8221; who specializes in helping realtors find new clients and sales leads. Apparently, this person re-used her Trello account password somewhere else (and/or perhaps re-used it from a list of passwords available on her Trello page), and as a result someone added a &#8220;You hacked&#8221; card to the assistant&#8217;s Trello board, urging her to change the password.</p>
<p>One realtor from Austin, Texas who posted numerous passwords to her public Trello board apparently had <a href="https://twitter.com/PamelaKAshley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her Twitter profile hijacked</a> and defaced with a photo featuring a giant Nazi flag and assorted Nazi memorabilia. It&#8217;s not clear how the hijacker obtained her password, but it appears to have been on Trello for some time.</p>
<p>Other entities that inadvertently shared passwords for private resources via public Trello boards included a Chinese aviation authority; the <strong>International AIDS Society</strong>; and the global technology consulting and research firm <a href="http://www.analysysmason.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analysis Mason</a>, which also exposed its <a href="https://twitter.com/AnalysysMason" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account</a> credentials on Trello until very recently. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/further-down-the-trello-rabbit-hole/#more-43780" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>MyHeritage</strong>, an Israeli-based genealogy and DNA testing company, disclosed today that a security researcher found on the Internet a file containing the email addresses and hashed passwords of more than 92 million of its users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-44166" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/myheritage.png" alt="" width="591" height="110" /></p>
<p>MyHeritage says it has no reason to believe other user data was compromised, and it is urging all users to <a href="http://helpcenter.myheritage.com/Account-Settings/Change-password-Email/634030922501487720/How-do-I-change-my-email-address-and-or-password.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change their passwords</a>. It says sensitive customer DNA data is stored on IT systems that are separate from its user database, and that user passwords were &#8220;hashed&#8221; &#8212; or churned through a mathematical model designed to turn them into unique pieces of gibberish text that is (in theory, at least) difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>MyHeritage did not say <a href="https://blog.myheritage.com/2018/06/myheritage-statement-about-a-cybersecurity-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in its blog post</a> which method it used to obfuscate user passwords, but suggested that it had added some uniqueness to each password (beyond the hashing) to make them all much harder to crack.</p>
<p>&#8220;MyHeritage does not store user passwords, but rather a one-way hash of each password, in which the hash key differs for each customer,&#8221; wrote <strong>Omer Deutsch</strong>, MyHeritage&#8217;s chief information security officer. &#8220;This means that anyone gaining access to the hashed passwords does not have the actual passwords.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company said the security researcher who found the user database reported it on Monday, June 4. The file contained the email addresses and hashed passwords of 92,283,889 users who created accounts at MyHeritage up to and including Oct. 26, 2017, which MyHeritage says was &#8220;the date of the breach.&#8221;</p>
<p>MyHeritage added that it is expediting work on an upcoming two-factor authentication option that the company plans to make available to all MyHeritage users soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will allow users interested in taking advantage of it, to authenticate themselves using a mobile device in addition to a password, which will further harden their MyHeritage accounts against illegitimate access,&#8221; the blog post concludes.</p>
<p>MyHeritage has not yet responded to requests for comment and clarification on several points. I will update this post if that changes. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/researcher-finds-credentials-for-92-million-users-of-dna-testing-firm-myheritage/#more-44151" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Google</strong> is reminding organizations to review how much of their <strong>Google Groups</strong> mailing lists should be public and indexed by Google.com. The notice was prompted in part by a review that KrebsOnSecurity undertook with several researchers who&#8217;ve been busy cataloging thousands of companies that are using public Google Groups lists to manage customer support and in some cases sensitive internal communications.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-44115" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/googgroups.png" alt="" width="591" height="227" /></p>
<p>Google Groups is a service from Google that provides discussion groups for people sharing common interests. Because of the organic way Google Groups tend to grow as more people are added to projects &#8212; and perhaps given the ability to create public accounts on otherwise private groups &#8212; a number of organizations with household names are leaking sensitive data in their message lists.</p>
<p>Many Google Groups leak emails that should probably not be public but are nevertheless searchable on Google, including personal information such as passwords and financial data, and in many cases comprehensive lists of company employee names, addresses and emails.</p>
<p>By default, Google Groups are set to private. But Google acknowledges that there have been &#8220;a small number of instances where customers have accidentally shared sensitive information as a result of misconfigured Google Groups privacy settings.&#8221;</p>
<p>In early May, KrebsOnSecurity heard from two researchers at <a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenna Security</a> who started combing through Google Groups for sensitive data. They found thousands of organizations that seem to be inadvertently leaking internal or customer information.</p>
<p>The researchers say <a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com/widespread-google-groups-misconfiguration-exposes-sensitive-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they discovered more than 9,600 organizations</a> with public Google Groups settings, and estimate that about one-third of those organizations are currently leaking some form of sensitive email. Those affected include Fortune 500 companies, hospitals, universities and colleges, newspapers and television stations and U.S. government agencies.</p>
<p>In most cases, to find sensitive messages it&#8217;s enough to load the company&#8217;s public Google Groups page and start typing in key search terms, such as &#8220;password,&#8221; &#8220;account,&#8221; &#8220;hr,&#8221; &#8220;accounting,&#8221; &#8220;username&#8221; and &#8220;http:&#8221;.</p>
<p>Many organizations seem to have used Google Groups to index customer support emails, which can contain all kinds of personal information &#8212; particularly in cases where one employee is emailing another.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of their more eyebrow-raising finds:</p>
<p>• Re: Document(s) for Review for Customer [REDACTED]. Group: Accounts Payable<br />
• Re: URGENT: Past Due Invoice. Group: Accounts Payable<br />
• Fw: Password Recovery. Group: Support<br />
• GitHub credentials. Group: [REDACTED]<br />
• Sandbox: Finish resetting your Salesforce password. Group: [REDACTED]<br />
• RE: [REDACTED] Suspension Documents. Group: Risk and Fraud Management</p>
<p>Apart from exposing personal and financial data, misconfigured Google Groups accounts sometimes publicly index a tremendous amount of information about the organization itself, including links to employee manuals, staffing schedules, reports about outages and application bugs, as well as other internal resources.</p>
<p>This information could be a potential gold mine for hackers seeking to conduct so-called &#8220;spearphishing&#8221; attacks that single out specific employees at a targeted organization. Such information also would be useful for criminals who specialize in &#8220;business email compromise&#8221; (BEC) or &#8220;CEO fraud&#8221; schemes, in which thieves spoof emails from top executives to folks in finance asking for large sums of money to be wired to a third-party account in another country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The possible implications include spearphishing, account takeover, and a wide variety of case-specific fraud and abuse,&#8221; the Kenna Security team wrote.</p>

												<p>For as long as scam artists have been around so too have opportunistic thieves who specialize in ripping off other scam artists. This is the story about a group of Pakistani Web site designers who apparently have made an impressive living impersonating some of the most popular and well known &#8220;carding&#8221; markets, or online stores that sell stolen credit cards.</p>
<div id="attachment_34283" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34283" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-34283" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/jstashcard.png" alt="" width="250" height="352" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/jstashcard.png 862w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/jstashcard-580x815.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/jstashcard-768x1080.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><p id="caption-attachment-34283" class="wp-caption-text">An ad for new stolen cards on Joker&#8217;s Stash.</p></div>
<p>One wildly popular carding site that has been <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/03/carders-park-piles-of-cash-at-jokers-stash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured in-depth</a> at KrebsOnSecurity &#8212; <strong>Joker&#8217;s Stash</strong> &#8212; brags that the millions of credit and debit card accounts for sale via their service were stolen from merchants firsthand.</p>
<p>That is, the people running Joker&#8217;s Stash say they are hacking merchants and directly selling card data stolen from those merchants. Joker&#8217;s Stash has been tied to several recent retail breaches, including those at <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/data-breach-saks-lord-taylor-compromises-customer-payment-data-n861856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord and Taylor</a>, <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/bebe-stores-confirms-credit-card-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bebe Stores</a>, <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=hilton+breach&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hilton Hotels</a>, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/4-years-after-target-the-little-guy-is-the-target/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason&#8217;s Deli</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/whole-foods-suffers-data-breach-in-some-stores.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whole Foods</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chipotle-cyber/chipotle-says-hackers-hit-most-restaurants-in-data-breach-idUSKBN18M2BY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chipotle</a> and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-sonic-drive-in-may-have-impacted-millions-of-credit-debit-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic</a>. Indeed, with most of these breaches, the first signs that any of the companies were hacked was when their customers&#8217; credit cards started showing up for sale on Joker&#8217;s Stash.</p>
<p>Joker&#8217;s Stash maintains a presence on several cybercrime forums, and its owners use those forum accounts to remind prospective customers that its Web site &#8212; <strong>jokerstash[dot]bazar </strong>&#8212; is the only way in to the marketplace.</p>
<p><em>The administrators constantly warn buyers to be aware there are many look-alike shops set up to steal logins to the real Joker&#8217;s Stash or to make off with any funds deposited with the impostor carding shop as a prerequisite to shopping there.</em></p>
<p>But that didn&#8217;t stop a prominent security researcher (not this author) from recently plunking down $100 in bitcoin at a site he thought was run by Joker&#8217;s Stash (<strong>jokersstash[dot]su</strong>). Instead, the proprietors of the impostor site said the minimum deposit for viewing stolen card data on the marketplace had increased to $200 in bitcoin.</p>
<p>The researcher, who asked not to be named, said he obliged with an additional $100 bitcoin deposit, only to find that his username and password to the card shop no longer worked. He&#8217;d been conned by scammers scamming scammers.</p>
<p>As it happens, prior to hearing from this researcher I&#8217;d received a mountain of research from <strong>Jett Chapman</strong>, another security researcher who swore he&#8217;d unmasked the real-world identity of the people behind the Joker&#8217;s Stash carding empire.</p>
<p>Chapman&#8217;s research, detailed in a 57-page report shared with KrebsOnSecurity, pivoted off of public information leading from the same jokersstash[dot]su that ripped off my researcher friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone to a few cybercrime forums where people who have used jokersstash[dot]su that were confused about who they really were,&#8221; Chapman said. &#8220;Many of them left feedback saying they&#8217;re scammers who will just ask for money to deposit on the site, and then you&#8217;ll never hear from them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the conclusion of Chapman&#8217;s report &#8212; that somehow jokersstash[dot]su was related to the real criminals running Joker&#8217;s Stash &#8212; didn&#8217;t ring completely accurate, although it was expertly documented and thoroughly researched. So with Chapman&#8217;s blessing, I shared his report with both the researcher who&#8217;d been scammed and a law enforcement source who&#8217;d been tracking Joker&#8217;s Stash.</p>
<p>Both confirmed my suspicions: Chapman had unearthed a vast network of sites registered and set up over several years to impersonate some of the biggest and longest-running criminal credit card theft syndicates on the Internet. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/will-the-real-jokers-stash-come-forward/#more-43784" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation </strong>(FBI) is warning that a new malware threat has rapidly infected more than a half-million consumer devices. To help arrest the spread of the malware, the FBI and security firms are urging home Internet users to reboot routers and network-attached storage devices made by a range of technology manufacturers.</p>
<p>The growing menace &#8212; dubbed <strong>VPNFilter</strong> &#8212; targets <strong>Linksys</strong>, <strong>MikroTik</strong>, <strong>NETGEAR</strong> and <strong>TP-Link</strong> networking equipment in the small and home office space, as well as <a href="https://www.qnap.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QNAP</a> network-attached storage (NAS) devices, according to researchers at <strong>Cisco</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-36655" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/networktechnicians.png" alt="" width="595" height="394" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/networktechnicians.png 1212w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/networktechnicians-580x384.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/networktechnicians-768x508.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/networktechnicians-940x622.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<p>Experts are still trying to learn all that VPNFilter is built to do, but for now they know it can do two things well: Steal Web site credentials; and issue a self-destruct command, effectively rendering infected devices inoperable for most consumers.</p>
<p>Cisco researchers said they&#8217;re not yet sure how these 500,000 devices were infected with VPNFilter, but that most of the targeted devices have known public exploits or default credentials that make compromising them relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this has contributed to the quiet growth of this threat since at least 2016,&#8221; the company <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on its <strong>Talos Intelligence blog</strong>.</p>
<p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said last week</a> that VPNFilter is the handiwork of &#8220;<a href="https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-apt28.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APT28</a>,&#8221; the security industry code name for a group of Russian state-sponsored hackers also known as &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fancy Bear</a>&#8221; and the &#8220;Sofacy Group.&#8221; This is the same group accused of conducting election meddling attacks during the 2016 U.S. presidential race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreign cyber actors have compromised hundreds of thousands of home and office routers and other networked devices worldwide,&#8221; the FBI said in <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180525.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a warning</a> posted to the Web site of the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> (IC3). &#8220;The actors used VPNFilter malware to target small office and home office routers. The malware is able to perform multiple functions, including possible information collection, device exploitation, and blocking network traffic.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Cisco, here&#8217;s a list of the known affected devices: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/fbi-kindly-reboot-your-router-now-please/#more-44020" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The past month has seen one blockbuster revelation after another about how our mobile phone and broadband providers have been leaking highly sensitive customer information, including <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/mobile-giants-please-dont-share-the-where/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real-time location data</a> and customer account details. In the wake of these consumer privacy debacles, many are left wondering who&#8217;s responsible for policing these industries? How exactly did we get to this point? What prospects are there for changes to address this national privacy crisis at the legislative and regulatory levels? These are some of the questions we&#8217;ll explore in this article.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-40944" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/capitol.png" alt="" width="591" height="277" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/capitol.png 1095w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/capitol-580x272.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/capitol-768x360.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/capitol-940x440.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></p>
<p>In 2015, the <strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong> under the Obama Administration reclassified broadband Internet companies as telecommunications providers, which gave the agency authority to regulate broadband providers the same way as telephone companies.</p>
<p>The FCC also came up with so-called &#8220;<strong>net neutrality</strong>&#8221; rules designed to prohibit Internet providers from blocking or slowing down traffic, or from offering &#8220;fast lane&#8221; access to companies willing to pay extra for certain content or for higher quality service.</p>
<p>In mid-2016, the FCC adopted new privacy rules for all Internet providers that would have required providers to seek opt-in permission from customers before collecting, storing, sharing and selling anything that might be considered sensitive &#8212; including Web browsing, application usage and location information, as well as financial and health data.</p>
<p>But the Obama administration&#8217;s new FCC privacy rules didn&#8217;t become final until December 2016, a month after then <strong>President-elect Trump</strong> was welcomed into office by a Republican controlled House and Senate.</p>
<p>Congress still had 90 legislative days (when lawmakers are physically in session) to pass a resolution killing the privacy regulations, and on March 23, 2017 the Senate voted 50-48 to repeal them. Approval of the repeal in the House passed quickly thereafter, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/04/04/trump-has-signed-repeal-of-the-fcc-privacy-rules-heres-what-happens-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Trump officially signed it on April 3, 2017</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-republicans-didnt-just-strip-away-your-internet-privacy-rights/2017/04/04/73e6d500-18ab-11e7-9887-1a5314b56a08_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.115f6c2bebb0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an op-ed</a> published in <em>The Washington Post</em>, <strong>Ajit Pai</strong> &#8212; a former <strong>Verizon</strong> lawyer and President Trump&#8217;s pick to lead the FCC &#8212; said &#8220;despite hyperventilating headlines, Internet service providers have never planned to sell your individual browsing history to third parties.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_43997" style="width: 261px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43997" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-43997" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pai.png" alt="" width="251" height="277" /><p id="caption-attachment-43997" class="wp-caption-text">FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;That’s simply not how online advertising works,&#8221; Pai wrote. &#8220;And doing so would violate ISPs’ privacy promises. Second, Congress’s decision last week didn’t remove existing privacy protections; it simply cleared the way for us to work together to reinstate a rational and effective system for protecting consumer privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Bill Nelson</strong> (D-Fla.) came to a different conclusion, predicting that the repeal of the FCC privacy rules would allow broadband providers to collect and sell a &#8220;gold mine of data&#8221; about customers.</p>
<aside id="" class="nativo-promo nativo-promo-1 smartphone"></aside>
<p>&#8220;Your mobile broadband provider knows how you move about your day through information about your geolocation and internet activity through your mobile device,&#8221; <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3184392/security/senate-votes-to-kill-fccs-broadband-privacy-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nelson said</a>. The Senate resolution &#8220;will take consumers out of this driver’s seat and place the collection and use of their information behind a veil of secrecy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pressure was building on the now Republican-controlled FCC to repeal the previous administration&#8217;s net neutrality rules. The major ISPs and mobile providers claimed the new regulations put them at a disadvantage relative to competitors that were not regulated by the FCC, such as <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>.</p>
<p>On Dec. 14, 2017, FCC Chairman Pai joined two other Republic FCC commissioners in a 3-2 vote to dismantle the net neutrality regulations.</p>
<p>As <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observed</a> after the net neutrality repeal, &#8220;the commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, vigorously defended the repeal before the vote. He said the rollback of the rules would eventually benefit consumers because broadband providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast could offer them a wider variety of service options.&#8221;</p>
<p class="css-c65vdd e2kc3sl0">“We are helping consumers and promoting competition,” Mr. Pai said. “Broadband providers will have more incentive to build networks, especially to underserved areas.”</p>
<h4>MORE OR LESS CHOICE?</h4>
<p>Some might argue we&#8217;ve seen reduced competition and more industry consolidation since the FCC repealed the rules. Major broadband and mobile provider <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> and cable/entertainment giant <strong>Time Warner</strong> are now <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/at-and-t-and-time-warner-trial-the-case-for-fearing-this-merger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fighting the Justice Department</a> in a bid to merge. Two of the four-largest mobile telecom and broadband providers &#8212; <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Sprint</strong> &#8212; have announced plans for a $26 billion merger.</p>
<p>The FCC privacy rules from 2016 that were overturned by Congress sought to give consumers more choice about how their data was to be used, stored and shared. But consumers now have less &#8220;choice&#8221; than ever about how their mobile provider shares their data and with whom. Worse, the mobile and broadband providers themselves are failing to secure their own customers&#8217; data.</p>
<p>This month, it emerged that the major mobile providers have been giving commercial third-parties the ability to instantly look up the precise location of any mobile subscriber in real time. KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that one of these third parties &#8212; <strong>LocationSmart</strong> &#8212; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/tracking-firm-locationsmart-leaked-location-data-for-customers-of-all-major-u-s-mobile-carriers-in-real-time-via-its-web-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked this ability for years to anyone via a buggy component on its Web site</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_43840" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43840" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-43840" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lsmartdemo.png" alt="" width="588" height="462" /><p id="caption-attachment-43840" class="wp-caption-text">LocationSmart&#8217;s demo page featured a buggy component which allowed anyone to look up anyone else&#8217;s mobile device location, in real time, and without consent.</p></div>
<p>We also learned that another California company &#8212; <strong>Securus Technologies</strong> &#8212; was selling real-time location lookups to a number of state and local law enforcement agencies, and that accounts for dozens of those law enforcement officers were obtained by hackers.  Securus, it turned out, was ultimately getting its data from LocationSmart.</p>
<p>This week, researchers discovered that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tmobile-bug-let-anyone-see-any-customers-account-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bug in T-Mobile&#8217;s Web site</a> let anyone access the personal account details of any customer with just their cell phone number, including full name, address, account number and some cases tax ID numbers.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Comcast was revealed to have exposed sensitive information on customers through <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/comcast-bug-leaks-xfinity-home-addresses-wireless-passwords/?eminfo=%7b%22EMAIL%22%3a%22VLzRxZi4rMVdgSngCyb3GeQhYo7NmfVjwQUDPlrOtHw%3d%22%2c%22BRAND%22%3a%22FO%22%2c%22CONTENT%22%3a%22Newsletter%22%2c%22UID%22%3a%22FO_DTA_09F95225-D548-4858-B2A9-9F65162EB451%22%2c%22SUBID%22%3a%2282537088%22%2c%22JOBID%22%3a%22750449%22%2c%22NEWSLETTER%22%3a%22DATA_SHEET%22%2c%22ZIP%22%3a%22%22%2c%22COUNTRY%22%3a%22%22%7d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a buggy component of its Web site</a> that could be tricked into displaying the home address where the company&#8217;s wireless router is located, as well as the router&#8217;s Wi-Fi name and password.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how FCC Chairman Pai intends to &#8220;reinstate a rational and effective system for protecting consumer privacy,&#8221; as he pledged after voting last year to overturn the 2015 privacy rules. The FCC reportedly has taken at least tentative steps to open an inquiry into the LocationSmart debacle, although <strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.) has called on Chairman Pai to recuse himself on the inquiry because Pai once represented Securus as an attorney. (Wyden also had <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/wydenstatement.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some choice words</a> for the wireless companies).</p>
<p>The major wireless carriers all say they do not share customer location data <em>without customer consent</em> or in response to a court order or subpoena. Consent. All of these carriers pointed me to their privacy policies. It could be the carriers believe these policies clearly explain that simply by using their wireless device customers have opted-in to having their real-time location data sold or given to third-party companies.</p>
<p><strong>Michelle De Mooy</strong>, director of the privacy and data project at the <a href="https://www.cdt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</a> (CDT), said if the mobile giants are burying that disclosure in privacy policy legalese, that&#8217;s just not good enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if they say, &#8216;Our privacy policy says we can do this,&#8217; it violates peoples&#8217; reasonable expectations of when and why their location data is being collected and how that&#8217;s going to be used. It&#8217;s not okay to simply point to your privacy policies and expect that to be enough.&#8221;</p>

												<p>Federal prosecutors have charged three men with carrying out a deadly hoax known as &#8220;swatting,&#8221; in which perpetrators call or message a target&#8217;s local 911 operators claiming a fake hostage situation or a bomb threat in progress at the target&#8217;s address &#8212; with the expectation that local police may respond to the scene with deadly force. While only one of the three men is accused of making the phony call to police that got an innocent man shot and killed, investigators say the other two men&#8217;s efforts to taunt and deceive one another ultimately helped point the gun.</p>

<p>According to prosecutors, the tragic hoax started with a dispute over a match in the online game &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty</a>.&#8221; The indictment says <strong>Shane M. Gaskill</strong>, a 19-year-old Wichita, Kansas resident, and <strong>Casey S. Viner</strong>, 18, had a falling out over a $1.50 game wager.</p>
<p>Viner allegedly wanted to get back at Gaskill, and so enlisted the help of another man &#8212; <strong>Tyler R. Barriss</strong> &#8212; a serial swatter known by the alias &#8220;SWAuTistic&#8221; who&#8217;d <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/serial-swatter-swautistic-bragged-he-hit-100-schools-10-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bragged of &#8220;swatting&#8221; hundreds of schools and dozens of private residences.</a></p>
<p>The federal indictment references transcripts of alleged online chats among the three men. In an exchange on Dec. 28, 2017, Gaskill taunts Barriss on Twitter after noticing that Barriss&#8217;s Twitter account (@swattingaccount) had suddenly started following him.</p>
<p>Viner and Barriss both allegedly say if Gaskill isn&#8217;t scared of getting swatted, he should give up his home address. But the address that Gaskill gave Viner to pass on to Barriss no longer belonged to him and was occupied by a new tenant.</p>
<p>Barriss allegedly then called the emergency 911 operators in Wichita and said he was at the address provided by Viner, that he&#8217;d just shot his father in the head, was holding his mom and sister at gunpoint, and was thinking about burning down the home with everyone inside.</p>
<p>Wichita police quickly responded to the fake hostage report and surrounded the address given by Gaskill. Seconds later, 28-year-old <strong>Andrew Finch</strong> exited his mom&#8217;s home and was killed by a single shot from a Wichita police officer. Finch, a father of two, had no party to the gamers&#8217; dispute and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>Just minutes after the fatal shooting, Barriss &#8212; who is in Los Angeles  &#8212; is allegedly anxious to learn if his Kansas swat attempt was successful. Someone has just sent Barriss a screenshot of a conversation between Viner and Gaskill mentioning police at Gaskill&#8217;s home and someone getting killed. So Barriss allegedly then starts needling Gaskill via instant message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defendant BARRISS: Yo answer me this<br />
Defendant BARRISS: Did police show up to your house yes or no<br />
Defendant GASKILL: No dumb fuck<br />
Defendant BARRISS: Lmao here’s how I know you’re lying</p></blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors say Barriss then posted a screen shot showing the following conversation between Viner and Gaskill:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defendant VINER: Oi<br />
Defendant GASKILL: Hi<br />
Defendant VINER: Did anyone show @ your house?<br />
Defendant VINER: Be honest<br />
Defendant GASKILL: Nope<br />
Defendant GASKILL: The cops are at my house because someone ik just killed his dad</p></blockquote>
<p>Barriss and Gaskill then allegedly continued their conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defendant GASKILL: They showed up to my old house retard<br />
Defendant BARRISS: That was the call script<br />
Defendant BARRISS: Lol<br />
Defendant GASKILL: Your literally retarded<br />
Defendant GASKILL: Ik dumb ass<br />
Defendant BARRISS: So you just got caught in a lie<br />
Defendant GASKILL: No I played along with you<br />
Defendant GASKILL: They showed up to my old house that we own and rented out<br />
Defendant GASKILL: We don’t live there anymore bahahaha<br />
Defendant GASKILL: ik you just wasted your time and now your pissed<br />
Defendant BARRISS: Not really<br />
Defendant BARRISS: Once you said “killed his dad” I knew it worked lol<br />
Defendant BARRISS: That was the call lol<br />
Defendant GASKILL: Yes it did buy they never showed up to my house<br />
Defendant GASKILL: You guys got trolled<br />
Defendant GASKILL: Look up who live there we moved out almost a year ago<br />
Defendant GASKILL: I give you props though you’re the 1% that can actually swat babahaha<br />
Defendant BARRISS: Dude MY point is You gave an address that you dont live at but you were acting tough lol<br />
Defendant BARRISS: So you’re a bitch</p></blockquote>
<p>Later on the evening of Dec. 28, after news of the fatal swatting started blanketing the local television coverage in Kansas, Gaskill allegedly told Barriss to delete their previous messages. &#8220;Bape&#8221; in this conversation refers to a nickname allegedly used by Casey Viner: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/3-charged-in-fatal-kansas-swatting-attack/#more-43950" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
