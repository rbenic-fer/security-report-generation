												<p><strong>Microsoft </strong>today released updates to plug at least 110 security holes in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and other products. The patches include four security fixes for <strong>Microsoft Exchange Server</strong> &#8212; the same systems that have been <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=microsoft+exchange+attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">besieged by attacks on four separate (and zero-day) bugs in the email software</a> over the past month. Redmond also patched a Windows flaw that is actively being exploited in the wild.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-52647" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png" alt="" width="719" height="528" /></p>
<p>Nineteen of the vulnerabilities fixed this month earned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire &#8220;Critical&#8221; label, meaning they could be used by malware or malcontents to seize remote control over vulnerable Windows systems without any help from users.</p>
<p>Microsoft released updates to fix four more flaws in Exchange Server versions 2013-2019 (<a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-28480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-28480</a>, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-28481" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-28481</a>, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-28482" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-28482</a>, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-28483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-28483</a>). Interestingly, all four were reported by the <strong>U.S. National Security Agency</strong>, although Microsoft says it also found two of the bugs internally. A <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/04/13/april-2021-update-tuesday-packages-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft blog post</a> published along with today&#8217;s patches urges Exchange Server users to make patching their systems a top priority.</p>
<p><strong>Satnam Narang</strong>, staff research engineer at <strong>Tenable</strong>, said these vulnerabilities have been rated &#8216;Exploitation More Likely&#8217; using Microsoft’s Exploitability Index.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of the four vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-28480, CVE-2021-28481) are pre-authentication, meaning an attacker does not need to authenticate to the vulnerable Exchange server to exploit the flaw,&#8221; Narang said. &#8220;With the intense interest in Exchange Server since last month, it is crucial that organizations apply these Exchange Server patches immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also patched today was a vulnerability in Windows (<a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-28310" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-28310</a>) that&#8217;s being exploited in active attacks already. The flaw allows an attacker to elevate their privileges on a target system.</p>
<p>&#8220;This does mean that they will either need to log on to a system or trick a legitimate user into running the code on their behalf,&#8221; said <strong>Dustin Childs</strong> of <strong>Trend Micro</strong>. &#8220;Considering who is listed as discovering this bug, it is probably being used in malware. Bugs of this nature are typically combined with other bugs, such as browser bug of PDF exploit, to take over a system.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a technical writeup on what they&#8217;ve observed since finding and reporting attacks on CVE-2021-28310, researchers at <strong>Kaspersky Lab</strong> <a href="https://securelist.com/zero-day-vulnerability-in-desktop-window-manager-cve-2021-28310-used-in-the-wild/101898/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> the exploit they saw was likely used together with other browser exploits to escape &#8220;sandbox&#8221; protections of the browser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we weren’t able to capture a full chain, so we don’t know if the exploit is used with another browser zero-day, or coupled with known, patched vulnerabilities,&#8221; Kaspersky&#8217;s researchers wrote. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/microsoft-patch-tuesday-april-2021-edition/#more-55225" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Someone is selling account information for 21 million customers of <a href="https://www.parkmobile.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParkMobile</a>, a mobile parking app that&#8217;s popular in North America. The stolen data includes customer email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, license plate numbers, hashed passwords and mailing addresses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-55209" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/parkmobile-ad.png" alt="" width="703" height="457" /></p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity first heard about the breach from <a href="https://www.geminiadvisory.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini Advisory</a>, a New York City based threat intelligence firm that keeps a close eye on the cybercrime forums. Gemini shared a new sales thread on a Russian-language crime forum that included my ParkMobile account information in the accompanying screenshot of the stolen data.</p>
<p>Included in the data were my email address and phone number, as well as license plate numbers for four different vehicles we have used over the past decade.</p>
<p>Asked about the sales thread, Atlanta-based ParkMobile said the company <a href="https://support.parkmobile.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058639032-Security-Notification-March-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a notification on Mar. 26</a> about &#8220;a cybersecurity incident linked to a vulnerability in a third-party software that we use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In response, we immediately launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm to address the incident,&#8221; the notice reads. &#8220;Out of an abundance of caution, we have also notified the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The investigation is ongoing, and we are limited in the details we can provide at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement continues: &#8220;Our investigation indicates that no sensitive data or Payment Card Information, which we encrypt, was affected. Meanwhile, we have taken additional precautionary steps since learning of the incident, including eliminating the third-party vulnerability, maintaining our security, and continuing to monitor our systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked for clarification on what the attackers did access, ParkMobile confirmed it included basic account information – license plate numbers, and if provided, email addresses and/or phone numbers, and vehicle nickname.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a small percentage of cases, there may be mailing addresses,&#8221; spokesman <strong>Jeff Perkins</strong> said.<br />

												<p>Ne&#8217;er-do-wells leaked personal data &#8212; including phone numbers &#8212; for some 553 million <strong>Facebook</strong> users this week. Facebook <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> the data was collected before 2020 when it changed things to prevent such information from being scraped from profiles. To my mind, this just reinforces the need to remove mobile phone numbers from all of your online accounts wherever feasible. Meanwhile, if you&#8217;re a Facebook <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/976473447374221313" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><del>product</del></a> user and want to learn if your data was leaked, there are easy ways to find out.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HaveIBeenPwned</a> project, which collects and analyzes hundreds of database dumps containing information about billions of leaked accounts, has <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-facebook-phone-numbers-are-now-searchable-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incorporated the data into his service</a>. Facebook users can enter the mobile number (in international format) associated with their account and see if those digits were exposed in the new data dump (HIBP doesn&#8217;t show you any data, just gives you a yes/no on whether your data shows up). <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-55183" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hibp.png" alt="" width="773" height="360" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hibp.png 1258w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hibp-768x358.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hibp-782x364.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /></p>
<p>The phone number associated with my late Facebook account (which I deleted in Jan. 2020) was not in HaveIBeenPwned, but then again Facebook claims to have more than 2.7 billion active monthly users.</p>
<p>It appears much of this database has been kicking around the cybercrime underground in one form or another since last summer at least. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1349671294808285184/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Jan. 14, 2021 Twitter post from Under the Breach&#8217;s Alon Gal</a>, the 533 million Facebook accounts database was first put up for sale back in June 2020, offering Facebook profile data from 100 countries, including name, mobile number, gender, occupation, city, country, and marital status.</p>
<p>Under The Breach <a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1349671417625931778" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also said back in January</a> that someone had created a Telegram bot allowing users to query the database for a low fee, and enabling people to find the phone numbers linked to a large number of Facebook accounts.</p>

<p>Many people may not consider their mobile phone number to be private information, but there is a world of misery that bad guys, stalkers and creeps can visit on your life just by knowing your mobile number. Sure they could call you and harass you that way, but more likely they will see how many of your other accounts &#8212; at major email providers and social networking sites like Facebook, <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, e.g. &#8212; rely on that number for password resets. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/are-you-one-of-the-533m-people-who-got-facebooked/#more-55179" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Some of the top ransomware gangs are deploying a new pressure tactic to push more victim organizations into paying an extortion demand: Emailing the victim&#8217;s customers and partners directly, warning that their data will be leaked to the dark web unless they can convince the victim firm to pay up.</p>
<div id="attachment_55166" style="width: 641px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55166" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-55166" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ransompushred.png" alt="" width="631" height="691" /><p id="caption-attachment-55166" class="wp-caption-text">This letter is from the Clop ransomware gang, putting pressure on a recent victim named on Clop&#8217;s dark web shaming site.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Good day! If you received this letter, you are a customer, buyer, partner or employee of [victim],&#8221; the missive reads. &#8220;The company has been hacked, data has been stolen and will soon be released as the company refuses to protect its peoples&#8217; data.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We inform you that information about you will be published on the darknet [link to dark web victim shaming page] if the company does not contact us,&#8221; the message concludes. &#8220;Call or write to this store and ask to protect your privacy!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>The message above was sent to a customer of <strong>RaceTrac Petroleum</strong>, an Atlanta company that operates more than 650 retail gasoline convenience stores in 12 southeastern states. The person who shared that screenshot above isn&#8217;t a distributor or partner of RaceTrac, but they said they are a RaceTrac rewards member, so the company definitely has their email address and other information.</p>
<p>Several gigabytes of the company&#8217;s files &#8212; including employee tax and financial records &#8212; have been posted to the victim shaming site for the <strong>Clop</strong> ransomware gang.</p>
<p>In response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity, RaceTrac said it was recently impacted by a security incident affecting one of its third-party service providers, <strong>Accellion Inc. </strong></p>
<p>For the past few months, attackers have been exploiting a <a href="https://www.accellion.com/company/press-releases/accellion-provides-update-to-recent-fta-security-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a zero-day vulnerability in Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) software</a>, a flaw that has been seized upon by Clop to break into dozens of other major companies like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/oil-giant-shell-discloses-data-breach-linked-to-accellion-fta-vulnerability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oil giant Shell</a> and <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252497263/Qualys-caught-up-in-Accellion-FTA-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security firm Qualys</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;By exploiting a previously undetected software vulnerability, unauthorized parties were able to access a subset of RaceTrac data stored in the Accellion File Transfer Service, including email addresses and first names of some of our RaceTrac Rewards Loyalty users,&#8221; the company <a href="https://www.racetrac.com/Accellion-Incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. &#8220;This incident was limited to the aforementioned Accellion services and did not impact RaceTrac’s corporate network. The systems used for processing guest credit, debit and RaceTrac Rewards transactions were not impacted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same extortion pressure email has been going out to people associated with the <strong>University of California</strong>, which was one of <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/attackers-disclose-data-of-students-in-cyberattack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several large U.S. universities that got hit with Clop ransomware recently</a>. Most of those university ransomware incidents appeared to be tied to attacks on attacks on the same Accellion vulnerability, and the company has acknowledged roughly a third of its customers on that appliance got compromised as a result.</p>
<p>Clop is one of several ransom gangs that will demand two ransoms: One for a digital key needed to unlock computers and data from file encryption, and a second to avoid having stolen data published or sold online. That means even victims who opt not to pay to get their files and servers back still have to decide whether to pay the second ransom to protect the privacy of their customers.</p>
<p>As I noted in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/why-paying-to-delete-stolen-data-is-bonkers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Paying to Delete Stolen Data is Bonkers</a>, leaving aside the notion that victims might have any real expectation the attackers will actually destroy the stolen data, new research suggests a fair number of victims who do pay up may see some or all of the stolen data published anyway. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ransom-gangs-emailing-victim-customers-for-leverage/#more-55161" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>For four days this past week, Internet-of-Things giant <strong>Ubiquiti </strong> did not respond to requests for comment on a whistleblower&#8217;s allegations the company had massively downplayed a &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; two-month breach ending in January to save its stock price, and that Ubiquiti&#8217;s insinuation that a third-party was to blame was a fabrication. I was happy to add their eventual public response to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the top of Tuesday&#8217;s story on the whistleblower&#8217;s claims</a>, but their statement deserves a post of its own because it actually confirms and reinforces those claims.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-55018" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ubiquiti.png" alt="" width="762" height="213" /></p>
<p>Ubiquiti&#8217;s IoT gear includes things like WiFi routers, security cameras, and network video recorders. Their products have long been popular with security nerds and DIY types because they make it easy for users to build their own internal IoT networks without spending many thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>But some of that shine started to come off recently for Ubiquiti&#8217;s more security-conscious customers after the company began pushing everyone to use a unified authentication and access solution that makes it difficult to administer these devices without first authenticating to Ubiquiti&#8217;s cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, local-only networks were being connected to Ubiquiti&#8217;s cloud, giving rise to countless discussion threads on Ubiquiti&#8217;s user forums from customers upset over the potential for introducing new security risks.</p>
<p>And on Jan. 11, Ubiquiti gave weight to that angst: It told customers to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/ubiquiti-change-your-password-enable-2fa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reset their passwords and enable multifactor authentication</a>, saying a breach involving a third-party cloud provider might have exposed user account data. Ubiquiti told customers they were &#8220;not currently aware of evidence of access to any databases that host user data, but we cannot be certain that user data has not been exposed.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_54003" style="width: 637px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54003" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-54003" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ubi-notice.png" alt="" width="627" height="662" /><p id="caption-attachment-54003" class="wp-caption-text">Ubiquiti&#8217;s notice on Jan. 12, 2021.</p></div>
<p>On Tuesday, KrebsOnSecurity reported that a source who participated in the response to the breach said Ubiquiti should have immediately invalidated all credentials because all of the company&#8217;s key administrator passwords had been compromised as well. The whistleblower also said Ubiquiti never kept any logs of who was accessing its databases.</p>
<p>The whistleblower, &#8220;<strong>Adam</strong>,&#8221; spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from Ubiquiti. Adam said the place where those key administrator credentials were compromised &#8212; Ubiquiti&#8217;s presence on Amazon&#8217;s Web Services (AWS) cloud services &#8212; was in fact the &#8220;third party&#8221; blamed for the hack.</p>
<p>From Tuesday&#8217;s piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In reality, Adam said, the attackers had gained administrative access to Ubiquiti’s servers at Amazon’s cloud service, which secures the underlying server hardware and software but requires the cloud tenant (client) to secure access to any data stored there.</p>
<p>“They were able to get cryptographic secrets for single sign-on cookies and remote access, full source code control contents, and signing keys exfiltration,” Adam said.</p>
<p>Adam says the attacker(s) had access to privileged credentials that were previously stored in the LastPass account of a Ubiquiti IT employee, and gained root administrator access to all Ubiquiti AWS accounts, including all S3 data buckets, all application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and secrets required to forge single sign-on (SSO) cookies.</p>
<p>Such access could have allowed the intruders to remotely authenticate to countless Ubiquiti cloud-based devices around the world. According to its website, Ubiquiti has shipped more than 85 million devices that play a key role in networking infrastructure in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ubiquiti finally responded on Mar. 31, in <a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Update-to-January-2021-Account-Notification/3813e6f4-b023-4d62-9e10-1035dc51ad2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post signed &#8220;Team UI&#8221; on the company&#8217;s community forum online</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has changed with respect to our analysis of customer data and the security of our products since our notification on January 11. In response to this incident, we leveraged external incident response experts to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure the attacker was locked out of our systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These experts identified no evidence that customer information was accessed, or even targeted. The attacker, who unsuccessfully attempted to extort the company by threatening to release stolen source code and specific IT credentials, never claimed to have accessed any customer information. This, along with other evidence, is why we believe that customer data was not the target of, or otherwise accessed in connection with, the incident.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_55156" style="width: 783px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UI-response.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55156" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-55156" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UI-response.png" alt="" width="773" height="495" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UI-response.png 854w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UI-response-768x492.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/UI-response-782x501.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55156" class="wp-caption-text">Ubiquiti&#8217;s response this week on its user forum.</p></div>
<p>Ubiquiti also hinted it had an idea of who was behind the attack, saying it has &#8220;well-developed evidence that the perpetrator is an individual with intricate knowledge of our cloud infrastructure. As we are cooperating with law enforcement in an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment further.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ubiquiti-all-but-confirms-breach-response-iniquity/#more-55110" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Dear Readers, this has been long overdue, but at last I give you a more responsive, mobile-friendly version of KrebsOnSecurity. We tried to keep the visual changes to a minimum and focus on a simple theme that presents information in a straightforward, easy-to-read format. Please bear with us over the next few days as we hunt down the gremlins in the gears.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-55100" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sitelaunch.png" alt="" width="599" height="636" /></p>
<p>We were shooting for responsive (fast) and uncluttered. Hopefully, we achieved that and this new design will render well in whatever device you use to view it. If something looks amiss, please don&#8217;t hesitate to drop a note in the comments below.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> KrebsOnSecurity has not changed any of its advertising practices: The handful of ads we run are still image-only creatives that are vetted by me and served in-house. If you&#8217;re blocking ads on this site, please consider adding an exception here. Thank you!</p>

												<p>On Jan. 11, <strong><a href="https://www.ui.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubiquiti Inc.</a></strong> [NYSE:UI] &#8212; a major vendor of cloud-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as routers, network video recorders and security cameras &#8212; disclosed that a breach involving a third-party cloud provider had exposed customer account credentials. Now a source who participated in the response to that breach alleges Ubiquiti massively downplayed a &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; incident to minimize the hit to its stock price, and that the third-party cloud provider claim was a fabrication.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55018" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ubiquiti.png" alt="" width="519" height="145" /></p>
<p><strong>Update, Dec. 5, 2021: </strong>The Justice Department has indicted a former Ubiquiti developer for allegedly <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/12/ubiquiti-developer-charged-with-extortion-causing-2020-breach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">causing the 2020 &#8220;breach&#8221; and trying to extort the company</a>. </p>
<p><em>Original story: </em></p>
<p>A security professional at Ubiquiti who helped the company respond to the two-month breach beginning in December 2020 contacted KrebsOnSecurity after raising his concerns with both Ubiquiti&#8217;s whistleblower hotline and with European data protection authorities. The source &#8212; we&#8217;ll call him <strong>Adam </strong>&#8212; spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by Ubiquiti.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was catastrophically worse than reported, and legal silenced and overruled efforts to decisively protect customers,&#8221; Adam wrote in a letter to the European Data Protection Supervisor. &#8220;The breach was massive, customer data was at risk, access to customers&#8217; devices deployed in corporations and homes around the world was at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ubiquiti has not responded to repeated requests for comment.</p>
<p><strong> Update, Mar. 31, 6:58 p.m. ET:</strong> In <a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Update-to-January-2021-Account-Notification/3813e6f4-b023-4d62-9e10-1035dc51ad2e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post to its user forum</a>, Ubiquiti said its security experts identified &#8220;no evidence that customer information was accessed, or even targeted.&#8221; Ubiquiti can say this, says Adam, because it failed to keep records of which accounts were accessing that data. We&#8217;ll hear more about this from Adam in a bit.</p>
<p><em>Original story:</em></p>
<p>According to Adam, the hackers obtained full read/write access to Ubiquiti databases at <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (AWS), which was the alleged &#8220;third party&#8221; involved in the breach. Ubiquiti&#8217;s breach disclosure, he wrote, was &#8220;downplayed and purposefully written to imply that a 3rd party cloud vendor was at risk and that Ubiquiti was merely a casualty of that, instead of the target of the attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/ubiquiti-change-your-password-enable-2fa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its Jan. 11 public notice</a>, Ubiquiti said it became aware of &#8220;unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems hosted by a third party cloud provider,&#8221; although it declined to name the third party.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-54003" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ubi-notice.png" alt="" width="598" height="632" /></p>
<p>In reality, Adam said, the attackers had gained administrative access to Ubiquiti&#8217;s servers at Amazon&#8217;s cloud service, which secures the underlying server hardware and software but requires the cloud tenant (client) to secure access to any data stored there.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were able to get cryptographic secrets for single sign-on cookies and remote access, full source code control contents, and signing keys exfiltration,&#8221; Adam said.</p>
<p>Adam says the attacker(s) had access to privileged credentials that were previously stored in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LastPass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LastPass</a> account of a Ubiquiti IT employee, and gained root administrator access to all Ubiquiti AWS accounts, including all S3 data buckets, all application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and secrets required to forge single sign-on (SSO) cookies.</p>
<p>Such access could have allowed the intruders to remotely authenticate to countless Ubiquiti cloud-based devices around the world. According to its website, Ubiquiti has shipped more than 85 million devices that play a key role in networking infrastructure in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/#more-55007" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>New data suggests someone has compromised more than 21,000 <strong>Microsoft Exchange Server</strong> email systems worldwide and infected them with malware that invokes both KrebsOnSecurity and Yours Truly by name.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-54572" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/exchange.png" alt="" width="776" height="262" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/exchange.png 1072w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/exchange-768x259.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just get this out of the way right now: It wasn&#8217;t me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shadowserver.org/news/shadowserver-special-report-exchange-scanning-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shadowserver Foundation</a>, a nonprofit that helps network owners <a href="https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identify and fix security threats</a>, says it has found 21,248 different Exchange servers which appear to be compromised by a backdoor and communicating with <strong>brian[.]krebsonsecurity[.]top</strong> (NOT a safe domain, hence the hobbling).</p>
<p>Shadowserver has been tracking <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/a-basic-timeline-of-the-exchange-mass-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wave after wave of attacks targeting flaws in Exchange</a> that Microsoft addressed earlier this month in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/microsoft-chinese-cyberspies-used-4-exchange-server-flaws-to-plunder-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an emergency patch release</a>. The group looks for attacks on Exchange systems using a combination of active Internet scans and &#8220;honeypots&#8221; &#8212; systems left vulnerable to attack so that defenders can study what attackers are doing to the devices and how.</p>
<p><strong>David Watson, </strong>a longtime member and director of the Shadowserver Foundation Europe, says his group has been keeping a close eye on hundreds of unique variants of backdoors (a.k.a. &#8220;web shells&#8221;) that various cybercrime groups worldwide have been using to commandeer any unpatched Exchange servers. These backdoors give an attacker complete, remote control over the Exchange server (including any of the server&#8217;s emails).</p>
<p>On Mar. 26, Shadowserver saw an attempt to install a new type of backdoor in compromised Exchange Servers, and with each hacked host it installed the backdoor in the same place: &#8220;<strong>/owa/auth/babydraco.aspx.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The web shell path that was dropped was new to us,&#8221; said Watson said. &#8220;We have been testing 367 known web shell paths via scanning of Exchange servers.&#8221;</p>
<p>OWA refers to <strong>Outlook Web Access</strong>, the Web-facing portion of on-premises Exchange servers. Shadowserver&#8217;s honeypots saw multiple hosts with the Babydraco backdoor doing the same thing: Running a Microsoft Powershell script that fetches the file &#8220;krebsonsecurity.exe&#8221; from the Internet address <strong>159.65.136[.]128</strong>. Oddly, none of the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5f7d898ade3162bfb0c8d3006c42e934ff81fab3b4ad3b51c13441fd63e438cb/behavior/VirusTotal%20Jujubox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several dozen antivirus tools available</a> to scan the file at <strong>Virustotal.com</strong> currently detect it as malicious.</p>
<p>The Krebsonsecurity file also installs a root certificate, modifies the system registry, and tells Windows Defender not to scan the file. Watson said the Krebsonsecurity file will attempt to open up an encrypted connection between the Exchange server and the above-mentioned IP address, and send a small amount of traffic to it each minute. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/no-i-did-not-hack-your-ms-exchange-server/#more-54964" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A phishing attack last week gave attackers access to email and files at the <a href="https://www.sco.ca.gov/eo_about_resp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California State Controller&#8217;s Office</a> (SCO), an agency responsible for handling more than $100 billion in public funds each year. The phishers had access for more than 24 hours, and sources tell KrebsOnSecurity the intruders used that time to steal Social Security numbers and sensitive files on thousands of state workers, and to send targeted phishing messages to at least 9,000 other workers and their contacts.</p>
<div id="attachment_54936" style="width: 779px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/califsco.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54936" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54936" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/califsco.png" alt="" width="769" height="288" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/califsco.png 1240w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/califsco-768x287.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-54936" class="wp-caption-text">A notice of breach posted by the California State Controller&#8217;s Office.</p></div>
<p>In a &#8220;<a href="https://sco.ca.gov/upd_msg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notice of Data Breach</a>&#8221; message posted on Saturday, Mar. 20, the Controller&#8217;s Office said that for more than 24 hours starting on the afternoon of March 18 attackers had access to the email records of an employee in its Unclaimed Property Division after the employee clicked a phishing link and then entered their email ID and password.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SCO has reason to believe the compromised email account had personal identifying information contained in Unclaimed Property Holder Reports,&#8221; the agency said, urging state employees contacted by the agency to place fraud alerts on their credit files with the major consumer bureaus.  &#8220;The unauthorized user also sent potentially malicious emails to some of the SCO employee&#8217;s contacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SCO responded in an email that no state employee data was compromised.</p>
<p>&#8220;A single employee email account was briefly compromised by a spear phishing attack and promptly disabled,&#8221; SCO spokesperson <strong>Jennifer Hanson</strong> said. &#8220;SCO has notified the employee’s contacts who may have received a potentially malicious email from the unauthorized user. SCO team members have identified all personal information included in the compromised email account and begun the process of notifying affected parties. The Controller is going over and beyond the notification requirements in law by providing both actual mailed notification and substitute notification in an effort to ensure the broadest possible notification.&#8221;</p>
<p>A source in an adjacent California state agency who&#8217;s been tracking the incident internally with other employees says the SCO forgot to mention the intruders also had access to the phished employee&#8217;s <strong>Microsoft Office 365 files </strong>&#8212; and potentially any files shared with that account across the state network.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t even the full extent of the breach,&#8221; said the California state employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/phish-leads-to-breach-at-calif-state-controller/#more-54930" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Remember<strong> Norse Corp.</strong>, the company behind the interactive &#8220;pew-pew&#8221; cyber attack map shown in the image below? Norse imploded rather suddenly in 2016 following a series of managerial missteps and funding debacles. Now, the founders of Norse have launched a new company with a somewhat different vision: <strong>RedTorch</strong>, which for the past two years has marketed a mix of services to high end celebrity clients, including spying and anti-spying tools and services.</p>
<div id="attachment_33735" style="width: 785px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/norsemap.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33735" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-33735" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/norsemap.png" alt="" width="775" height="382" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/norsemap.png 2398w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/norsemap-580x285.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/norsemap-768x378.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/norsemap-940x463.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33735" class="wp-caption-text">A snapshot of Norse&#8217;s semi-live attack map, circa Jan. 2016.</p></div>
<p>Norse&#8217;s attack map was everywhere for several years, and even became a common sight in the &#8220;brains&#8221; of corporate security operations centers worldwide. Even if the data that fueled the maps was not particularly useful, the images never failed to enthrall visitors viewing them on room-sized screens.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the tech-heavy, geek-speak world of cybersecurity, these sorts of infographics and maps are popular because they promise to make complicated and boring subjects accessible and sexy,&#8221; I wrote in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/01/sources-security-firm-norse-corp-imploding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a January 2016 story about Norse&#8217;s implosion</a>. &#8220;And Norse’s much-vaunted interactive attack map was indeed some serious eye candy: It purported to track the source and destination of countless Internet attacks in near real-time, and showed what appeared to be multicolored fireballs continuously arcing across the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p>That story showed the core Norse team had a history of ambitious but ultimately failed or re-branded companies. One company proclaimed it was poised to spawn a network of cyber-related firms, but instead ended up selling cigarettes online. That company, which later came under investigation by state regulators concerned about underage smokers, later rebranded to another start-up that tried to be an online copyright cop.</p>
<p>Flushed with venture capital funding in 2012, Norse&#8217;s founders started hiring dozens of talented cybersecurity professionals. By 2014 it was throwing lavish parties at top  Internet security conferences. It spent quite a bit of money on marketing gimmicks and costly advertising stunts, burning through millions in investment funding. In 2016, financial reality once again would catch up with the company&#8217;s leadership when Norse <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/01/sources-security-firm-norse-corp-imploding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abruptly ceased operations and was forced to lay off most of its staff</a>.</p>
<p>Now the top executives behind Norse Corp. are working on a new venture: A corporate security and investigations company called RedTorch that&#8217;s based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive">Woodland Hills, Calif</a>, the home of many Hollywood celebrities.</p>
<p>RedTorch&#8217;s website currently displays a &#8220;We&#8217;re coming soon&#8221; placeholder page. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806220931/http://redtorch.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a version of the site that ran for two years beginning in 2018</a> explained what clients can expect from the company&#8217;s services:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Frigg Mobile Intelligence,&#8221; for helping celebrities and other wealthy clients do background checks on the people in their lives;</li>
<li>&#8220;Cheetah Counter Surveillance&#8221; tools/services to help deter others from being able to spy on clients electronically;</li>
<li>A &#8220;Centurion Research&#8221; tool for documenting said snooping on others.</li>
</ul>

The Guy Fawkes mask/Anonymous threat featured prominently and often on RedTorch&#8217;s website.</p></div>
<p>The closest thing to eye candy for RedTorch is its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806220831/http://redtorch.com/cheetah.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheetah Counter Surveillance product line</a>, a suite of hardware and software meant to be integrated into other security products which &#8212; according to RedTorch &#8212; constantly sweeps the client&#8217;s network and physical office space with proprietary technology designed to detect remote listening bugs and other spying devices.</p>
<p>Frigg, another core RedTorch offering, is&#8230;well, friggin&#8217; spooky:</p>
<p>&#8220;Frigg is the easiest way to do a full background check and behavioral analysis on people,&#8221; the product pitch reads. &#8220;Frigg not only shows background checks, but social profiles and a person&#8217;s entire internet footprint, too. This allows one to evaluate a person’s moral fiber and ethics. Frigg employs machine learning and analytics on all known data from a subject&#8217;s footprint, delivering instant insight so you can make safer decisions, instantly.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_54870" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/frigg.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54870" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54870" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/frigg.png" alt="" width="770" height="279" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/frigg.png 1096w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/frigg-768x278.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-54870" class="wp-caption-text">The background checking service from RedTorch, called Frigg, says it&#8217;s building &#8220;one of the world&#8217;s largest facial recognition databases and a very accurate facial recognition match standard.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Frigg promises to include &#8220;elements that stems [sic] from major data hacks of known systems like Ashley Madison, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Fling.com, AdultFriendFinder and hundreds more. Victims of those breaches lost a lot of private data including passwords, and Frigg will help them secure their private data in the future. The matching that is shown will use email, phone and full name correlation.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the rest of Frigg:</p>
<blockquote><p>Frigg references sanction lists such as OFAC, INTERPOL wanted persons, and many more international and domestic lists. Known locations results are based on social media profiles and metadata where, for example, there was an image posted that showed GPS location, or the profile mentions locations among its comments.</p>
<p>Frigg provides the option of continuous monitoring on searched background reports. Notification will be sent or shown once an important update or change has been detected</p>
<p>The flagship version of Frigg will allow a user to upload a picture of a face and get a full background check instantly. <em>RedTorch is working to develop one of the world&#8217;s largest facial recognition databases and a very accurate facial recognition match standard.</em></p></blockquote>
<h4>WHO IS REDTORCH?</h4>
<div id="attachment_54866" style="width: 779px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/white-grey.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54866" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54866" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/white-grey.png" alt="" width="769" height="362" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/white-grey.png 1150w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/white-grey-768x361.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-54866" class="wp-caption-text">The co-founders of Norse Networks, &#8220;Mr. White&#8221; (left) Norse Corp. co-founder and RedTorch CEO Henry Marx;, and &#8220;Mr. Grey,&#8221; CTO and Norse Corp. co-founder Tommy Stiansen.</p></div>
<p>RedTorch claims it is building a huge facial recognition database, so it&#8217;s perhaps no surprise that its founders prefer to obscure theirs. The contact email on RedTorch says henry @redtorch dot com. That address belongs to <strong>RedTorch Inc. CEO Henry Marx</strong>, a former <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-marx-a672716/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music industry executive</a> and co-founder of Norse Networks.</p>
<p>Marx did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did any of the other former Norse Corp. executives mentioned throughout this story. So I should emphasize that it&#8217;s not even clear whether the above-mentioned products and services from RedTorch actually exist.</p>
<p>One executive at Red Torch told this author privately that the company had plenty of high-paying clients, although that person declined to be more specific about what RedTorch might do for those clients or why the company&#8217;s site was currently in transition.</p>
<p>Now a cadre of former Norse Corp. employees who have been tracking the company&#8217;s past executives say they&#8217;ve peered through the playful subterfuge in the anonymous corporate identities on the archived RedTorch website.</p>
<p>Marx appears to be the &#8220;Mr. White&#8221; referenced in the screenshot above, taken from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200808025735/http://redtorch.com/aboutteam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an archived Aug. 2020 version of RedTorch.com</a>. He is wearing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guy Fawkes mask</a>, a symbol favored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Anonymous hacker collective</a>, the doomed man behind the failed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gunpowder plot of 1604 in England</a>, and by possibly the most annoying costumes that darken your front door each Halloween.</p>
<p>Mr. White says he has &#8220;over 30 years in the entertainment industry; built numerous brands and controlled several areas of the entertainment business side,&#8221; and that he&#8217;s &#8220;accomplished over 200 million sold artist performances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pictured beside Mr. White is RedTorch&#8217;s co-founder, &#8220;Mr. Grey.&#8221; Norse watchers say that would be <strong>Tommy Stiansen</strong>, the Norwegian former co-founder of Norse Corp. whose <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommystiansen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> says is now chief technology officer at RedTorch. One of his earliest companies provided &#8220;operational billing solutions for telecom networks.&#8221;</p>
