							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>A Web site set up by PC maker <b>Dell Inc.</b> to help customers recover from malicious software and other computer maladies may have been hijacked for a few weeks this summer by people who specialize in deploying said malware, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<p>There is a program installed on virtually all Dell computers called &#8220;Dell Backup and Recovery Application.&#8221; It&#8217;s designed to help customers restore their data and computers to their pristine, factory default state should a problem occur with the device. That backup and recovery program periodically checks a rather catchy domain name &#8212; <strong>DellBackupandRecoveryCloudStorage.com </strong>&#8212; which until recently was central to PC maker Dell&#8217;s customer data backup, recovery and cloud storage solutions.</p>
<p>Sometime this summer, DellBackupandRecoveryCloudStorage.com was suddenly snatched away from a longtime Dell contractor for a month and exposed to some questionable content. More worryingly, there are signs the domain may have been pushing malware before Dell&#8217;s contractor regained control over it.</p>
<div id="attachment_33929" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33929" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-33929" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/dellwiki-580x429.png" alt="" width="580" height="429" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/dellwiki-580x429.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/dellwiki.png 716w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-33929" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Wikipedia</p></div>
<p>The purpose of DellBackupandRecoveryCloudStorage.com is inscribed in the hearts of countless PCs that Dell shipped customers over the past few years. The domain periodically gets checked by the &#8220;Dell Backup and Recovery application,&#8221;<em> </em>which &#8220;enables the user to backup and restore their data with just a few clicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>This program comes in two versions: Basic and Premium, explains &#8220;<strong>Jesse L</strong>,&#8221; a Dell customer liaison and a blogger on the company&#8217;s site.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Basic version comes pre-installed on all systems and allows the user to create the system recovery media and take a backup of the factory installed applications and drivers,&#8221;Jesse L <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/4677/t/19471699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>. &#8220;It also helps the user to restore the computer to the factory image in case of an OS issue.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_41277" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41277" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-41277" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dellbackup.png" alt="" width="598" height="557" /><p id="caption-attachment-41277" class="wp-caption-text">Dell customer liaison Jesse L. talks about how the program in question is by default installed on all Dell PCs.</p></div>
<p>In other words: If DellBackupandRecoveryCloudStorage.com were to fall into the wrong hands it could be used to foist malicious software on Dell users seeking solace and refuge from just such nonsense!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear how or why DellBackupandRecoveryCloudStorage.com got away from <a href="http://softthinks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoftThinks.com</a> &#8212;  an Austin, Tex.-based software backup and imaging solutions provider that originally registered the domain back in mid-2013 and has controlled it for most of the time since. But someone at SoftThinks apparently forgot to renew the domain in mid-June 2017.</p>
<p>SoftThinks lists Dell among some of its &#8220;great partners&#8221; (see screenshot below). It hasn&#8217;t responded to requests for comment. Some of its other partners include <strong>Best Buy</strong> and <strong>Radio Shack</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_41271" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41271" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-41271" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/softthinks-partners.png" alt="" width="595" height="211" /><p id="caption-attachment-41271" class="wp-caption-text">Some of SoftThinks&#8217; partners. Source: SoftThinks.com</p></div>
<p>From early June to early July 2017, DellBackupandRecoveryCloudStorage.com was the property of <strong>Dmitrii Vassilev </strong>of<em>  </em>&#8220;<strong>TeamInternet.com</strong>,&#8221; a company listed in Germany that specializes in selling what appears to be typosquatting traffic. Team Internet also appears to be tied to a domain monetization business called <strong>ParkingCrew</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what typosquatting is, think of what sometimes happens when you&#8217;re typing out a URL in the browser&#8217;s address field and you fat-finger a single character and suddenly get redirected to the kind of content that makes you look around quickly to see if anyone saw you looking at it. For more on Team Internet, see <a href="https://dyn.com/blog/ne-body-out-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this enlightening Aug. 2017 post </a>from <b>Chris Baker </b>at internet infrastructure firm <strong>Dyn. </strong> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/dell-lost-control-of-key-customer-support-domain-for-a-month-in-2017/#more-41267" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>It&#8217;s been just over a year since the world witnessed some of the world&#8217;s top online Web sites being taken down for much of the day by &#8220;<strong>Mirai</strong>,&#8221; a zombie malware strain that enslaved &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices such as wireless routers, security cameras and digital video recorders for use in large-scale online attacks.</p>
<p>Now, experts are sounding the alarm about the emergence of what appears to be a far more powerful strain of IoT attack malware &#8212; variously named &#8220;<strong>Reaper</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>IoTroop</strong>&#8221; &#8212; that spreads via security holes in IoT software and hardware. And there are indications that over a million organizations may be affected already.</p>
<p>Reaper isn&#8217;t attacking anyone yet. For the moment it is apparently content to gather gloom to itself from the darkest reaches of the Internet. But if history is any teacher, we are likely enjoying a period of false calm before another humbling IoT attack wave breaks.</p>

<p>On Oct. 19, 2017, researchers from Israeli security firm <strong>CheckPoint</strong> <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/new-iot-botnet-storm-coming/">announced</a> they&#8217;ve been tracking the development of a massive new IoT botnet &#8220;forming to create a cyber-storm that could take down the Internet.&#8221; CheckPoint said the malware, which it called &#8220;IoTroop,&#8221; had already infected an estimated one million organizations.</p>
<p>The discovery came almost a year to the day after the Internet witnessed <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most impactful cyberattacks ever</a> &#8212; against online infrastructure firm <strong>Dyn</strong> at the hands of &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=mirai&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirai</a>,&#8221; an IoT malware strain that first surfaced in the summer of 2016. According to CheckPoint, however, this new IoT malware strain is &#8220;evolving and recruiting IoT devices at a far greater pace and with more potential damage than the Mirai botnet of 2016.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike Mirai &#8212; which wriggles into vulnerable IoT devices using factory-default or hard-coded usernames and passwords &#8212; this newest IoT threat leverages at least nine known security vulnerabilities across nearly a dozen different device makers, including <a href="https://github.com/Trietptm-on-Security/AVTECH">AVTECH</a>, <a href="https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3364">D-Link</a>, <a href="https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-03-08-camera-goahead-0day.html">GoAhead</a>, <a href="https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3409">Netgear</a>, and <a href="http://www.s3cur1ty.de/m1adv2013-004">Linksys</a>, among others (click each vendor&#8217;s link to view security advisories for the flaws).</p>
<div id="attachment_41225" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41225" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-41225" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/trendofattackingips-reaper.png" alt="" width="574" height="314" /><p id="caption-attachment-41225" class="wp-caption-text">This graphic from CheckPoint charts a steep, recent rise in the number of Internet addresses trying to spread the new IoT malware variant, which CheckPoint calls &#8220;IoTroop.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Both Mirai and IoTroop are computer worms; they are built to spread automatically from one infected device to another. Researchers can&#8217;t say for certain what IoTroop will be used for but it is based at least in part on Mirai, which was made to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
<p>While DDoS attacks target a single Web site or Internet host, they often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption. IoT malware spreads by scanning the Internet for other vulnerable devices, and sometimes this scanning activity is so aggressive that it constitutes an unintended DDoS on the very home routers, Web cameras and DVRs that the bot code is trying to subvert and recruit into the botnet.</p>
<p>However, according to <a href="http://blog.netlab.360.com/iot_reaper-a-rappid-spreading-new-iot-botnet-en/">research released Oct. 20</a> by Chinese security firm <strong>Netlab 360</strong>, the scanning performed by the new IoT malware strain (Netlab calls it the more memorable &#8220;Reaper&#8221;) is not very aggressive, and is intended to spread much more deliberately than Mirai. Netlab&#8217;s researchers say Reaper partially borrows some Mirai source code, but is significantly different from Mirai in several key behaviors, including an evolution that allows Reaper to more stealthily enlist new recruits and more easily fly under the radar of security tools looking for suspicious activity on the local network. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#more-41218" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Researchers this week published information about a newfound, serious weakness in <strong>WPA2</strong> &#8212; the security standard that protects all modern Wi-Fi networks. What follows is a short rundown on what exactly is at stake here, who&#8217;s most at-risk from this vulnerability, and what organizations and individuals can do about it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3361" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/wifi-289x300.jpg" alt="wifi" width="289" height="300" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/wifi-289x300.jpg 289w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/wifi.jpg 532w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /></p>
<p>Short for <strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access II</strong>, WPA2 is the security protocol used by most wireless networks today. Researchers have discovered and published a flaw in WPA2 that allows anyone to break this security model and steal data flowing between your wireless device and the targeted Wi-Fi network, such as passwords, chat messages and photos.</p>
<p>&#8220;The attack works against all modern protected Wi-Fi networks,&#8221; the researchers <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/" target="_blank">wrote of their exploit</a> dubbed &#8220;KRACK,&#8221; short for &#8220;Key Reinstallation AttaCK.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on the network configuration, it is also possible to inject and manipulate data,&#8221; the researchers continued. &#8220;For example, an attacker might be able to inject ransomware or other malware into websites. The weaknesses are in the Wi-Fi standard itself, and not in individual products or implementations. Therefore, any correct implementation of WPA2 is likely affected.&#8221;</p>
<p>What that means is the vulnerability potentially impacts a wide range of devices including those running operating systems from Android, Apple, Linux, OpenBSD and Windows.</p>
<p>As scary as this attack sounds, there are several mitigating factors at work here. First off, this is not an attack that can be pulled off remotely: An attacker would have to be within range of the wireless signal between your device and a nearby wireless access point.</p>
<p>More importantly, most sensitive communications that might be intercepted these days, such as interactions with your financial institution or browsing email, are likely already protected end-to-end with <strong>Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (SSL) encryption that is separate from any encryption added by WPA2 &#8212; i.e., any connection in your browser that starts with &#8220;https://&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, the public announcement about this security weakness was held for weeks in order to give Wi-Fi hardware vendors a chance to produce security updates. The <strong>Computer Emergency Readiness Team</strong> has <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byvendor?searchview&amp;Query=FIELD+Reference=228519&amp;SearchOrder=4" target="_blank">a running list of hardware vendors</a> that are known to be affected by this, as well as links to available advisories and patches.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited maliciously, and <strong>Wi-Fi Alliance</strong> has taken immediate steps to ensure users can continue to count on Wi-Fi to deliver strong security protections,&#8221; reads <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-security-update" target="_blank">a statement</a> published today by a Wi-Fi industry trade group. &#8220;This issue can be resolved through straightforward software updates, and the Wi-Fi industry, including major platform providers, has already started deploying patches to Wi-Fi users. Users can expect all their Wi-Fi devices, whether patched or unpatched, to continue working well together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds great, but in practice a great many products on the CERT list are currently designated &#8220;unknown&#8221; as to whether they are vulnerable to this flaw. I would expect this list to be updated in the coming days and weeks as more information comes in.</p>
<p>Some readers have asked if MAC address filtering will protect against this attack. Every network-capable device has a hard-coded, unique &#8220;media access control&#8221; or MAC address, and most Wi-Fi routers have a feature that lets you only allow access to your network for specified MAC addresses.</p>
<p>However, because this attack compromises the WPA2 protocol that both your wireless devices and wireless access point use, MAC filtering is not a particularly effective deterrent against this attack. Also, MAC addresses can be spoofed fairly easily.</p>
<p>To my mind, those most at risk from this vulnerability are organizations that have not done a good job separating their wireless networks from their enterprise, wired networks. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/what-you-should-know-about-the-krack-wifi-security-weakness/#more-41189" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Big-three consumer credit bureau <strong>Equifax</strong> says it has removed third-party code from its credit report assistance Web site that prompted visitors to download spyware disguised as an update for <strong>Adobe&#8217;s Flash Player</strong> software.</p>
<div id="attachment_41154" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41154" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-41154" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eq-flash-adware-580x271.png" alt="Image: Randy-abrams.blogspot.com" width="580" height="271" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eq-flash-adware-580x271.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eq-flash-adware-768x359.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eq-flash-adware-940x440.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eq-flash-adware.png 987w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-41154" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Randy-abrams.blogspot.com</p></div>
<p>On Wednesday, security expert and blogger <strong>Randy Abrams</strong> <a href="https://randy-abrams.blogspot.com/2017/10/new-equifax-website-compromise.html" target="_blank">documented</a> how browsing a page at Equifax&#8217;s <a href="http://www.equifax.com/CreditReportAssistance/?/CreditReportAssistance" target="_blank">consumer information services portal</a> caused his browser to be served with a message urging him to download Adobe Flash Player.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I tried to find my credit report on the Equifax website I clicked on an Equifax link and was redirected to a malicious URL,&#8221; Abrahms wrote. &#8220;The URL brought up one of the ubiquitous fake Flash Player Update screens. &#8221;</p>
<p>Ars Technica&#8217;s <strong>Dan Goodin</strong> was the first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/equifax-website-hacked-again-this-time-to-redirect-to-fake-flash-update/" target="_blank">to cover the discovery</a>, and said the phony Flash Player installer was detected by several antivirus tools as &#8220;<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/puppum/2016/08/pup-friday-adware-family-eorezo/" target="_blank">Adware.Eorezo</a>,&#8221; an intrusive program that displays advertisements in Internet Explorer and may install browser toolbars and other unwanted programs.</p>
<p>Several hours after Goodin&#8217;s piece went live, Equifax disabled the page in question, saying it was doing so out of &#8220;an abundance of caution&#8221; while it investigated the claims.</p>
<p>In a follow-up statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity this afternoon, however, Equifax said the problem stemmed from a &#8220;third-party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data,&#8221; and that &#8220;the vendor&#8217;s code running on an Equifax Web site was serving malicious content.&#8221; Equifax did not say who the third party vendor was. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/equifax-credit-assistance-site-served-spyware/#more-41153" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Hyatt Corp.</strong> is alerting customers about another credit card breach at some hotels, the second major incident with the hospitality chain in as many years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-33392" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hyatt.png" alt="hyatt" width="237" height="231" />Hyatt said its cyber security team discovered signs of unauthorized access to payment card information from cards manually entered or swiped at the front desk of certain Hyatt-managed locations between March 18, 2017 and July 2, 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon discovery, we launched a comprehensive investigation to understand what happened and how this occurred, which included engaging leading third-party experts, payment card networks and authorities,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;Hyatt’s layers of defense and other cybersecurity measures helped to identify and resolve the issue. While this incident affects a small percentage of total payment cards used at the affected hotels during the at-risk dates.</p>
<p>The hotel chain said the incident affected payment card information – cardholder name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code – from cards manually entered or swiped at the front desk of certain Hyatt-managed locations. It added there is no indication that any other information was involved.</p>
<p>In late 2015, Hyatt <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/12/malware-driven-card-breach-at-hyatt-hotels/" target="_blank">announced</a> that for about four months that year hackers had <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/01/hyatt-card-breach-hit-250-hotels-in-50-nations/" target="_blank">gained access to credit card systems at 250 properties in 50 different countries</a>. This time, the breach appears to have impacted 41 properties across 11 countries. Only five of the Hyatt properties affected in this most recent breach included U.S. locations, including three resorts in Hawaii and one each in Guam and Puerto Rico. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/hyatt-hotels-suffers-2nd-card-breach-in-2-years/#more-41144" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> on Tuesday released software updates to fix at least 62 security vulnerabilities in <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Office</strong> and other software. Two of those flaws were detailed publicly before yesterday&#8217;s patches were released, and one of them is already being exploited in active attacks, so attackers already have a head start.</p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p><strong>Equifax Inc.</strong> said today an investigation into information stolen in the epic data breach the company disclosed on Sept. 7 revealed that intruders took a file containing 15.2 million UK records. The company says it is now working to inform 693,665 U.K. consumers whose data was stolen in the attack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equihax.png" alt="equihax" width="249" height="232" class="alignright size-full wp-image-40756" />Previously, Equifax said the breach impacted approximately 400,000 U.K. residents. But in a statement released Tuesday, Equifax said it would notify 693,665 U.K. consumers by mail that their personal information was jeopardized in the breach. This includes:</p>
<p>-12,086 consumers who had an email address associated with their Equifax.co.uk account in 2014 accessed.<br />
-14,961 consumers who had portions of their Equifax.co.uk membership details &#8212; such as username, password, secret questions and answers, as well as partial credit card details &#8212; accessed<br />
-29,188 consumers who had their drivers license numbers accessed<br />
-637,430 consumers who had their phone numbers accessed</p>
<p>The numbers include data that Equifax held on U.K. consumers as far back as 2011, the company said. Equifax did not say whether any of the above-mentioned data was encrypted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.K.&#8217;s <strong>National Cyber Security Centre</strong> is warning residents to be on their guard against phishing attacks made to look like communications from Equifax about the breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another risk to UK citizens affected by this data breach is that they could be on the receiving end of more targeted and realistic phishing messages,&#8221; the NCSC <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/statement-equifax-cyber-incident" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;Fraudsters can use the data to make their phishing messages look much more credible, including using real names and statements such as: &#8216;To show this is not a phishing email, we have included the month of your birth and the last 3 digits of your phone number&#8217;. These phishing messages may be unrelated to Equifax and may use more well known brands. It is unlikely that any organisations will ask their customers to reset security information or passwords as a result of the Equifax breach, but this may be a tactic employed by criminals.&#8221;</p>
<h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>Equifax has been widely criticized for <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continuously bungling their public response</a> to this still-unfolding data disaster, and today&#8217;s update about the extent of the breach in the U.K. was no exception. The Equifax Web site that hosts today&#8217;s press release serves &#8220;mixed content,&#8221; meaning it includes elements that are served over both encrypted and unencrypted pages. The practical effect of this varies depending on which browser you&#8217;re using, but some browsers will display a security warning when this happens.</p>
<p>That mixed content error may have something to do with a missing image in the press release. <a href="https://www.equifax.co.uk/about-equifax/press-releases/en_gb/-/blogs/equifax-ltd-uk-update-regarding-the-ongoing-investigation-into-us-cyber-security-incident" rel="noopener" target="_blank">That press release</a> was supposed to include an image that breaks down what exactly was stolen from U.K. residents &#8212; as detailed in the bulleted list above &#8212; but apparently the graphic was either removed or moved pre- or post-publication. Here&#8217;s what the press release looks like in Firefox (Equifax still hasn&#8217;t fixed this): <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/equifax-hackers-stole-info-on-693665-uk-residents/#more-41105" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In May, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/fraudsters-exploited-lax-security-at-equifaxs-talx-payroll-division/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke a story about lax security at a payroll division</a> of big-three credit bureau <strong>Equifax</strong> that let identity thieves access personal and financial data on an unknown number of Americans. Incredibly, this same division makes it simple to access detailed salary and employment history on a large portion of Americans using little more than someone&#8217;s Social Security number and date of birth &#8212; both data elements that were stolen in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-equifax-may-impact-143m-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent breach at Equifax</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-41054" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-580x226.png" alt="twn" width="580" height="226" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-580x226.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-768x300.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>At issue is a service provided by Equifax&#8217;s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=talx&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TALX division</a> called <a href="https://www.theworknumber.com/Employees/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Work Number</a>. The service is designed to provide automated employment and income verification for prospective employers, and tens of thousands of companies report employee salary data to it. The Work Number also allows anyone whose employer uses the service to provide proof of their income when purchasing a home or applying for a loan.</p>
<p>The homepage for this Equifax service wants to assure visitors that &#8220;Your personal information is protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With your consent your personal data can be retrieved only by credentialed verifiers,&#8221; Equifax assures us, referring mainly to banks and other entities that request salary data for purposes of setting credit limits.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn&#8217;t anywhere near true because most employers who contribute data to The Work Number &#8212; including Fortune 100 firms, government agencies and universities &#8212; rely on horribly weak authentication for access to the information.</p>
<p>To find out how easy it is to view your detailed salary history, you&#8217;ll need your employer&#8217;s name or employer code. Helpfully, <a href="https://secure.theworknumber.talx.com/popups/findEmployer.aspx?searchcriteria=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page</a> lets you look that up quite easily (although if you opt to list employers alphabetically by the first letter of the company name, there are so many entries for each letter that I found Equifax&#8217;s database simply crashes half the time instead of rendering the entire list).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-41055" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode-580x147.png" alt="findemployercode" width="580" height="147" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode-580x147.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode-768x194.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode-940x238.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/findemployercode.png 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s needed to access your salary and employment history? <a href="https://secure.theworknumber.talx.com/twneeer/PreAuthenticated/EnterEmployerSearchCriteria.ascx?ReturnUrl=%2ftwneeer%2femployee%2fpostauthenticated%2fapplicationsequenceerror.ascx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go here</a>, and enter the employer name or employer code. After that, it asks for a &#8220;user ID.&#8221; This might sound like privileged information, but in most cases this is just the employees&#8217;s Social Security number (or a portion of it).</p>
<p>At the next step, the site asks visitors to &#8220;enter your PIN,&#8221; short for Personal Identification Number. However, in the vast majority of cases this appears to be little more than someone&#8217;s eight-digit date of birth. The formats differ by employer, but it&#8217;s usually either yyyy/mm/dd or mm/dd/yyyy, without the slashes.</p>
<p>Successful validation to the system produces two sets of data: An employee&#8217;s salary and employment history going back at least a decade, and a report listing all of the entities (ostensibly, the aforementioned &#8220;credentialed verifiers&#8221;) that have previously requested and viewed this information.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re successfully &#8220;authenticated,&#8221; the system asks you to change your PIN to something more secret than your birthday. When the default PIN is changed, The Work Number prompts users to select a series of six challenge/response questions, which Equifax claims will &#8220;improve the security of your data and create an extra layer of protection on your account.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, consumers whose employee history is stored by this service effectively have no privacy or security unless they possess both the awareness that this service exists and the forethought to access their account online before identity thieves or others do it first.</em> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/equifax-breach-fallout-your-salary-history/#more-41048" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve been feeling left out because you weren&#8217;t among the lucky few hundred million or billion who had their personal information stolen in either the <strong>Equifax</strong> or <strong>Yahoo!</strong> breaches. Well buck up, camper: Both companies took steps to make you feel better today.</p>
<p>Yahoo! announced that, our bad!: It wasn&#8217;t just <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/12/yahoo-one-billion-more-accounts-hacked/" target="_blank">one billion users</a> who had their account information filched in its record-breaking 2013 data breach. It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/technology/yahoo-hack-3-billion-users.html?_r=0" target="_blank">more like three billion (read: all)</a> users. Meanwhile, big three credit bureau Equifax <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-equifax-2-5-million-more-americans-story.html" target="_blank">added 2.5 million more victims</a> to its roster of 143 million Americans who had their Social Security numbers and other personal data stolen in a breach earlier this year. At the same time, Equifax&#8217;s erstwhile CEO informed Congress that the breach was the result of even more bone-headed security than was first disclosed.</p>
<p>To those still feeling left out by either company after this spate of bad news, I have only one thing to say (although I feel a bit like a broken record in repeating this): <em>Assume you&#8217;re compromised, and take steps accordingly</em>.</p>
<div align="center"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pgg2LCY8iE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>If readers are detecting a bit of sarcasm and cynicism in my tone here, it may be that I&#8217;m still wishing I&#8217;d done almost anything else today besides watching three hours worth of testimony from former Equifax CEO <strong>Richard Smith</strong> before lawmakers on a panel of the <strong>House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee</strong>.</p>
<p>While he is no longer the boss of Equifax, Smith gamely agreed to submit to several day&#8217;s worth of grilling from legislators in both houses of Congress this week. It was clear from the questions that lawmakers didn&#8217;t ask in Round One, however, that Smith was far more prepared for the first batch of questioning than they were, and that the entire ordeal would amount to only a gentle braising.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Smith managed to paint an even more dismal picture than was already known about the company&#8217;s failures to secure the very data that makes up the core of its business. Helpfully, Smith clarified early on in the hearing that the company&#8217;s customers are in fact banks and other businesses &#8212; not consumers.</p>
<p>Smith told lawmakers that the breach stemmed from a combination of technological error and a human error, casting it as the kind of failure that could have happened to anyone. In reality, the company waited 4.5 months (after it discovered the breach in late July 2017) to fix a dangerous security flaw that it should have known was being exploited on Day One (~March 6 or 7, 2017).</p>
<p>&#8220;The human error involved the failure to apply a software patch to a dispute portal in March 2017,&#8221; Smith said. He declined to explain (and lawmakers inexplicably failed to ask) how 145.5 million Americans &#8212; nearly 60 percent of the adult population of the United States &#8212; could have had their information tied up in a dispute portal at Equifax. &#8220;The technological error involved a scanner which failed to detect a vulnerability on that particular portal.&#8221;</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-ceo-congress-testimony/" target="_blank">this Wired.com story</a>, Smith admitted that the data compromised in the breach was not encrypted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-reactid="274">When asked by representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois about what data Equifax encrypts in its systems, Smith admitted that the data compromised in the customer-dispute portal was stored in plaintext and would have been easily readable by attackers. &#8220;We use many techniques to protect data—encryption, tokenization, masking, encryption in motion, encrypting at rest,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;To be very specific, this data was not encrypted at rest.&#8221;</p>
<p data-reactid="277">It’s unclear exactly what of the pilfered data resided in the portal versus other parts of Equifax’s system, but it turns out that also didn’t matter much, given Equifax&#8217;s attitude toward encryption overall. “OK, so this wasn’t [encrypted], but your core is?” Kinzinger asked. “Some, not all,&#8221; Smith replied. &#8220;There are varying levels of security techniques that the team deploys in different environments around the business.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith also sought to justify the company&#8217;s historically poor breach response after it publicly disclosed the break-in on Sept. 7 &#8212; roughly 40 days after Equifax&#8217;s security team first became aware of the incident (on July 29). As many readers here are well familiar, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank">likened that breach response to a dumpster fire</a> &#8212; noting that it was perhaps the most haphazard and ill-conceived of any major data breach disclosure in history.</p>
<p>Smith artfully dodged questions of why the company waited so long to notify the public, and about the perception that Equifax sought to profit off of its own data breach. One lawmaker noted that Smith gave two public speeches in the second and third weeks of August in which <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/equifax-ceo-weeks-before-disclosing-breach-the-days-are-bright-for-equifax/614695087" target="_blank">he was quoted as saying</a> that fraud was a &#8220;a huge opportunity for Equifax,&#8221; and that it was a &#8220;massive, growing business&#8221; for the company.</p>
<p>Smith interjected that he had &#8220;no indication&#8221; that consumer data was compromised at the time of the Aug. 11 speech. As for the Aug. 17 address, he said &#8220;we did not know how much data was compromised, what data was compromised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Follow-up questions from lawmakers on the panel revealed that Smith didn&#8217;t ask for a briefing about what was then allegedly only classified internally as &#8220;suspicious activity&#8221; until August 15, almost two weeks after the company hired outside cybersecurity experts to examine the issue.</p>
<p>Smith also maneuvered around questions about why Equifax chose to disclose the breach on the very day that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma" target="_blank">Hurricane Irma</a> was dominating front-page news with an imminent landfall on the eastern seaboard of the United States.</p>
<p>However, Smith did blame Irma in explaining why the company&#8217;s phone systems were simply unable to handle the call volume from U.S. consumers concerned about the Category Five data breach, saying that Irma took down two of Equifax&#8217;s largest call centers days after the breach disclosure. He said the company handled over 420 million consumer visits to the portal designed to help people figure out whether they were victimized in the breach, underscoring how so many American adults were forced to revisit the site again and again because it failed to give people consistent answers about whether they were affected. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/fear-not-you-too-are-a-cybercrime-victim/#more-41002" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
