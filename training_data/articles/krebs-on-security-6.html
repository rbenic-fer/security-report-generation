												<p><strong>Microsoft </strong>on Tuesday issued an emergency software update to quash a security bug that&#8217;s been dubbed &#8220;<strong>PrintNightmare</strong>,&#8221; a critical vulnerability in all supported versions of<strong> Windows</strong> that is actively being exploited. The fix comes a week ahead of Microsoft&#8217;s normal monthly Patch Tuesday release, and follows the publishing of exploit code showing would-be attackers how to leverage the flaw to break into Windows computers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-52647" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png" alt="" width="757" height="556" /></p>
<p>At issue is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-34527</a>, which involves a flaw in the Windows Print Spooler service that could be exploited by attackers to run code of their choice on a target&#8217;s system. Microsoft says it has already detected active exploitation of the vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>Satnam Narang</strong>, staff research engineer at<strong> Tenable</strong>, said Microsoft&#8217;s patch warrants urgent attention because of the vulnerability&#8217;s ubiquity across organizations and the prospect that attackers could exploit this flaw in order to take over a Windows domain controller.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect it will only be a matter of time before it is more broadly incorporated into attacker toolkits,&#8221; Narang said. &#8220;PrintNightmare will remain a valuable exploit for cybercriminals as long as there are unpatched systems out there, and as we know, unpatched vulnerabilities have a long shelf life for attackers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/07/06/out-of-band-oob-security-update-available-for-cve-2021-34527/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s Security Response Center said it was delayed in developing fixes for the vulnerability in <strong>Windows Server 2016</strong>, <strong>Windows 10 version 1607</strong>, and <strong>Windows Server 2012</strong>. The fix also apparently includes a new feature that allows Windows administrators to implement stronger restrictions on the installation of printer software.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to installing the July 6, 2021, and newer Windows Updates containing protections for CVE-2021-34527, the printer operators’ security group could install both signed and unsigned printer drivers on a printer server,&#8221; reads Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005010-restricting-installation-of-new-printer-drivers-after-applying-the-july-6-2021-updates-31b91c02-05bc-4ada-a7ea-183b129578a7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support advisory</a>. &#8220;After installing such updates, delegated admin groups like printer operators can only install signed printer drivers. Administrator credentials will be required to install unsigned printer drivers on a printer server going forward.”</p>
<p>Windows 10 users can check for the patch by opening Windows Update. Chances are, it will show what&#8217;s pictured in the screenshot below &#8212; that <strong>KB5004945</strong> is available for download and install. A reboot will be required after installation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56215" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kb5004945.png" alt="" width="760" height="487" /></p>
<p>Friendly reminder: It&#8217;s always a good idea to backup your data before applying security updates. Windows 10 <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-back-up-your-computer-automatically-with-windows-1762867473" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has some built-in tools</a> to help you do that, either on a per-file/folder basis or by making a complete and bootable copy of your hard drive all at once. </p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s out-of-band update may not completely fix the PrinterNightmare vulnerability. Security researcher <a href="https://blog.gentilkiwi.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Benjamin Delpy</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi/status/1412771368534528001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted on Twitter</a> that the exploit still works on a fully patched Windows server if the server also has Point &#038; Print enabled &#8212; a Windows feature that automatically downloads and installs available printer drivers.</p>
<p>Delpy said it&#8217;s common for organizations to enable Point &#038; Print using group policies because it allows users to install printer updates without getting approval first from IT. </p>
<p>This post will be updated if Windows users start reporting any issues in applying the patch.</p>

Image: WD.</p></div>
<p>Countless <strong>Western Digital</strong> customers saw their <strong>MyBook Live</strong> network storage drives remotely wiped in the past month thanks to a bug in a product line the company stopped supporting in 2015, as well as a previously unknown zero-day flaw. But there is a similarly serious zero-day flaw present in a much broader range of newer Western Digital <strong>MyCloud</strong> network storage devices that will remain unfixed for many customers who can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t upgrade to the latest operating system.</p>
<p>At issue is a remote code execution flaw residing in all Western Digital network attached storage (NAS) devices running <strong>MyCloud</strong> <strong>OS 3</strong>, an operating system the company only recently stopped supporting.</p>
<p>Researchers <a href="https://www.flashback.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Radek Domanski</strong> and <strong>Pedro Ribeiro </strong></a>originally planned to present their findings at the <a href="https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2020/7/28/announcing-pwn2own-tokyo-2020-live-from-toronto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pwn2Own hacking competition in Tokyo</a> last year. But just days before the event Western Digital released <strong>MyCloud OS 5</strong>, which eliminated the bug they found. That update effectively nullified their chances at competing in Pwn2Own, which requires exploits to work against the latest firmware or software supported by the targeted device.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in February 2021, the duo published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsg9YgvGBec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this detailed YouTube video</a>, which documents how they discovered a chain of weaknesses that allows an attacker to remotely update a vulnerable device&#8217;s firmware with a malicious backdoor &#8212; using a low-privileged user account that has a blank password.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsg9YgvGBec" width="760" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>The researchers said Western Digital never responded to their reports. In a statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity, Western Digital said it received their report after Pwn2Own Tokyo 2020, but that at the time the vulnerability they reported had already been fixed by the release of My Cloud OS 5.</p>
<p>&#8220;The communication that came our way confirmed the research team involved planned to release details of the vulnerability and asked us to contact them with any questions,&#8221; Western Digital said. &#8220;We didn’t have any questions so we didn’t respond. Since then, we have updated our process and respond to every report in order to avoid any miscommunication like this again. We take reports from the security research community very seriously and conduct investigations as soon as we receive them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Western Digital ignored questions about whether the flaw found by Domanski and Ribeiro was ever addressed in OS 3.

												<p>Financial services giant <strong>Intuit</strong> this week informed 1.4 million small businesses using its <strong>QuickBooks Online Payroll</strong> and <strong>Intuit Online Payroll</strong> products that their payroll information will be shared with big-three consumer credit bureau <strong>Equifax </strong>starting later this year unless customers opt out by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Intuit says the change is tied to an &#8220;exciting&#8221; and &#8220;free&#8221; new service that will let millions of small business employees get easy access to employment and income verification services when they wish to apply for a loan or line of credit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56158" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/qop-tosdelta.png" alt="" width="578" height="736" /></p>
<p>&#8220;In early fall 2021, your QuickBooks Online Payroll subscription will include an automated income and employment verification service powered by <strong>The Work Number </strong>from Equifax,&#8221; reads the Intuit email, which <a href="https://glam.app.intuit.com/app/guesttos?glocale=en_US&amp;cid=DR_EM-ELM2953-001a-Text1-NA-TWNPayroll-NA-NA-CN-COMPL-NA-US-QBOPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes a link to the new Terms of Service</a>. &#8220;Your employees may need to verify their income and employment info when applying for things like loans, credit, or public aid. Before, you likely had to manually provide this info to lenders, creditors or government agencies. These verifications will be automated by The Work Number, which helps employees get faster approvals and saves you time.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Intuit spokesperson clarified that the new service is not available through QuickBooks Online or to QuickBooks Online users as a whole. Intuit&#8217;s FAQ on the changes is <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/data-utilities/get-answers-to-questions-about-the-work-number-from-equifax/00/897361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Equifax&#8217;s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=equifax+breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 megabreach that exposed the personal and financial details of 145.5 million Americans</a> may have shocked the public, but it did little to stop <a href="https://secure.theworknumber.talx.com/twneeer/PreAuthenticated/EnterEmployerSearchCriteria.ascx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a million employers</a> from continuing to sell Equifax their employee payroll data, <em>Bloomberg</em> found in late 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;The workforce-solutions unit is now among Equifax’s fastest-growing businesses, contributing more than a fifth of the firm’s $3.1 billion of revenue last year,&#8221; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-02/equifax-has-amassed-salary-details-for-people-at-7-100-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> <strong>Jennifer Surane</strong>. &#8220;Using payroll data from government agencies and thousands of employers &#8212; including a vast majority of Fortune 500 companies &#8212; Equifax has cultivated a database of 300 million current and historic employment records, according to regulatory filings.&#8221;</p>
<p>QuickBooks Online user <strong>Anthony Citrano</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/acitrano/status/1410351452346720259" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on Twitter about receiving the notice</a>, noting that the upcoming changes had yet to receive any attention in the financial or larger media space.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I read the terms, Equifax gets to proactively collect all payroll data just in case they need to share it later &#8212; similar to how they already handle credit reporting,&#8221; said Citrano, who is founder and CEO of <a href="https://acquicent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acquicent</a>, a company that issues non-fungible tokens (NFTs). &#8220;And that feels like a disaster waiting to happen, especially given Equifax&#8217;s history.&#8221;</p>
<p>In selling payroll data to Equifax, Intuit will be joining some of the world&#8217;s largest payroll providers. For example,<strong> ADP </strong>&#8212; the largest payroll software provider in the United States &#8212; has long shared payroll data with Equifax.</p>
<p>But Citrano said this move by Intuit will incorporate a large number of fairly small businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;ADP participates in some way already, but QuickBooks Online jumping on the bandwagon means a lot of employees of small to mid-sized businesses are going to be affected,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Why might small businesses want to think twice before entrusting Equifax with their payroll data? The answer is the company doesn&#8217;t have a great track record of protecting that information. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/intuit-to-share-payroll-data-from-1-4m-small-businesses-with-equifax/#more-56153" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Imagine waking up each morning knowing the identities of thousands of people who are about to be mugged for thousands of dollars each. You know exactly when and where each of those muggings will take place, and you&#8217;ve shared this information in advance with the authorities each day for a year with no outward indication that they are doing anything about it. How frustrated would you be?</p>
<div id="attachment_56121" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56121" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-56121" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/badcheck.png" alt="" width="760" height="286" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/badcheck.png 858w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/badcheck-768x289.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/badcheck-782x294.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56121" class="wp-caption-text">A counterfeit check image [redacted] that was intended for a person helping this fraud gang print and mail phony checks tied to a raft of email-based scams. One fraud-fighting group is intercepting hundreds to thousands of these per day.</p></div>
<p>Such is the curse of the fraud fighter known online by the handles &#8220;<strong>Brianna Ware</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>B. Ware</strong>&#8221; for short, a longtime member of a global group of volunteers who&#8217;ve infiltrated a cybercrime gang that disseminates counterfeit checks tied to a dizzying number of online scams.</p>
<p>For the past year, B. Ware has maintained contact with an insider from the criminal group that&#8217;s been sending daily lists of would-be victims who are to receive counterfeit checks printed using the real bank account information of legitimate companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some days we&#8217;re seeing thousands of counterfeit checks going out,&#8221; B. Ware said.</p>
<p>The scams used in connection with the fraudulent checks vary widely, from fake employment and &#8220;mystery shopper&#8221; schemes to those involving people who have been told they can get paid to cover their cars in advertisements (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2016/08/how-spot-car-wrap-scam" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the &#8220;car wrap&#8221; scam</a>).</p>
<div id="attachment_56122" style="width: 776px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56122" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-56122" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/letterwithcheck.png" alt="" width="766" height="434" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/letterwithcheck.png 1076w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/letterwithcheck-768x435.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/letterwithcheck-782x443.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56122" class="wp-caption-text">A form letter mailed out with a counterfeit check urges the recipient to text a phone number after the check has been deposited.</p></div>
<p>Most of the counterfeit checks being disseminated by this fraud group are in amounts ranging from $2,500 to $5,000. The crimes that the checks enable are known variously as &#8220;<strong>advanced fee</strong>&#8221; scams, in that they involve tricking people into making payments in anticipation of receiving something of greater value in return.</p>
<p>But in each scheme the goal is the same: Convince the recipient to deposit the check and then wire a portion of the amount somewhere else. A few days after the check is deposited, it gets invariably canceled by the organization whose bank account information was on the check. And then person who deposited the phony check is on the hook for the entire amount.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the car wrap scam, where they send you a check for $5,000, and you agree to keep $1,000 for your first payment and send the rest back to them in exchange for the car wrap materials,&#8221; B. Ware said. &#8220;Usually the check includes a letter that says they want you to text a specific phone number to let them know you received the check. When you do that, they&#8217;ll start sending you instructions on how and where to send the money.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_56123" style="width: 763px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56123" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-56123" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/autowrap.png" alt="" width="753" height="429" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/autowrap.png 774w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/autowrap-768x438.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56123" class="wp-caption-text">A typical confirmation letter that accompanies a counterfeit check for a car wrap scam.</p></div>
<p>Traditionally, these groups have asked recipients to transit money via wire transfer. But these days, B. Ware said, the same crooks are now asking people to forward the money via mobile applications like <strong>CashApp</strong> and <strong>Venmo</strong>.</p>
<p>B. Ware and other volunteer fraud fighters believe the fake checks gang is using people looped into phony employment schemes and wooed through online romance scams to print the counterfeit checks, and that other recruits are responsible for mailing them out each day.</p>
<p>&#8220;More often than not, the scammers creating the shipping labels will provide those to an unwitting accomplice, or the accomplice is told to log in to an account and print the labels,&#8221; B. Ware explained.</p>
<p>Often the counterfeit checks and labels forwarded by B. Ware&#8217;s informant come with notes attached indicating the type of scam with which they are associated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes they&#8217;re mystery shopper scams, and other times it&#8217;s overpayment for an item sold on Craigslist,&#8221; B. Ware said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know how the scammers are getting the account and routing numbers for these checks, but they are drawn on real companies and always scan fine through a bank&#8217;s systems initially. The recipients can deposit them at any bank, but we try to get the checks to the banks when we can so they have a heads up.&#8221;</p>
<h2>SHRINKING FROM THE FIREHOSE?</h2>
<p>Roughly a year ago, B. Ware&#8217;s group started sharing its intelligence with fraud investigators at <strong>FedEx</strong> and the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> &#8212; the primary delivery mechanisms for these counterfeit checks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fps.png" alt="" width="197" height="242" class="alignright size-full wp-image-56127" />Both the USPS and FedEx have an interest in investigating because the fraudsters in this case are using stolen shipping labels paid for by companies who have no idea their FedEx or USPS accounts are being used for such purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;In most cases, the name of the sender will be completely unrelated to what&#8217;s being sent,&#8221; B. Ware said. &#8220;For example, you&#8217;ll see a label for a letter to go out with a counterfeit check for a car wrap scam, and the sender on the shipping label will be something like XYZ Biological Resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>But B. Ware says a year later, there is little sign that anyone is interested in acting on the shared intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so much information that they really don&#8217;t want it anymore and they&#8217;re not doing anything about it,&#8221; B. Ware said of FedEx and the USPS. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like they&#8217;re turning a blind eye. There are so many of these checks going out each day that instead of trying to drink from the firehouse, they&#8217;re just turning their heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>FedEx did not respond to requests for comment. <strong>The U.S. Postal Inspection Service</strong> responded with a statement saying it &#8220;does not comment publicly on its investigative procedures and operational protocols.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/06/we-infiltrated-a-counterfeit-check-ring-now-what/#more-55409" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Hard drive giant <strong>Western Digital</strong> is urging users of its <strong>MyBook Live</strong> brand of network storage drives to disconnect them from the Internet, warning that malicious hackers are remotely wiping the drives using a critical flaw that can be triggered by anyone who knows the Internet address of an affected device.</p>
<div id="attachment_56085" style="width: 841px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56085" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-56085" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wd-help.png" alt="" width="831" height="565" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wd-help.png 831w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wd-help-768x522.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wd-help-782x532.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56085" class="wp-caption-text">One of many similar complaints on Western Digital&#8217;s user forum.</p></div>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wd-my-book-nas-devices-are-being-remotely-wiped-clean-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bleeping Computer</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/mass-data-wipe-in-my-book-devices-prompts-warning-from-western-digital/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ars Technica</a> pointed to <a href="https://community.wd.com/t/help-all-data-in-mybook-live-gone-and-owner-password-unknown/268111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a heated discussion thread on Western Digital&#8217;s user forum</a> where many customers complained of finding their <strong>MyBook Live</strong> and <strong>MyBook Live Duo</strong> devices completely wiped of their data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Western Digital has determined that some My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices are being compromised through exploitation of a remote command execution vulnerability,&#8221; the company said in a statement June 24. &#8220;In some cases, this compromise has led to a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device. The My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices received its final firmware update in 2015. We understand that our customers’ data is very important. We are actively investigating the issue and will provide an updated advisory when we have more information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Western Digital&#8217;s <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-21008-recommended-security-measures-wd-mybooklive-wd-mybookliveduo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brief advisory</a> includes <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18472#VulnChangeHistorySection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a link to an entry in the National Vulnerability Database for CVE-2018-18472</a>. The NVD writeup says Western Digital WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have a root Remote Command Execution bug.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be triggered by anyone who knows the IP address of the affected device, as exploited in the wild in June 2021 for factory reset commands,&#8221; NVD wrote.</p>
<p>Examine the CVE attached to this flaw and you&#8217;ll notice it was issued in 2018. The <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18472#VulnChangeHistorySection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVD&#8217;s advisory</a> credits VPN reviewer <strong>Wizcase.com</strong> with reporting the bug to Western Digital three years ago, back in June 2018. </p>
<p>In some ways, it&#8217;s remarkable that it took this long for vulnerable MyBook devices to be attacked: The 2018 Wizcase writeup on the flaw includes proof-of-concept code that lets anyone run commands on the devices as the all-powerful &#8220;root&#8221; user.  <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/06/mybook-users-urged-to-unplug-devices-from-internet/#more-56082" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In 2015, police departments worldwide started finding ATMs compromised with advanced new &#8220;shimming&#8221; devices made to steal data from chip card transactions. Authorities in the United States and abroad had seized many of these shimmers, but for years couldn&#8217;t decrypt the data on the devices. This is a story of ingenuity and happenstance, and how one former Secret Service agent helped crack a code that revealed the contours of a global organized crime ring.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Dant</strong> was a special agent at the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> for 12 years until 2015. After that, Dant served as the global lead for the fraud fusion center at <strong>Citi</strong>, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States.</p>
<p>Not long after joining Citi, Dant heard from industry colleagues at a bank in Mexico who reported finding one of these shimming devices inside the card acceptance slot of a local ATM. As it happens, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/chip-card-atm-shimmer-found-in-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about that particular shimmer back in August 2015</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_31892" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31892" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-31892" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shimalone.png" alt="" width="760" height="775" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shimalone.png 760w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/shimalone-580x591.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><p id="caption-attachment-31892" class="wp-caption-text">This card &#8216;shimming&#8217; device is made to read chip-enabled cards and can be inserted directly into the ATM&#8217;s card acceptance slot.</p></div>
<p>The shimmers were an innovation that caused concern on multiple levels. For starters, chip-based payment cards were supposed to be far more expensive and difficult for thieves to copy and clone. But these skimmers took advantage of weaknesses in the way many banks at the time implemented the new chip card standard.</p>
<p>Also, unlike traditional ATM skimmers that run on hidden cell phone batteries, the ATM shimmers found in Mexico did not require any external power source, and thus could remain in operation collecting card data until the device was removed.</p>
<p>When a chip card is inserted, a chip-capable ATM reads the data stored on the smart card by sending an electric current through the chip. Incredibly, these shimmers were able to siphon a small amount of that power (a few milliamps) to record any data transmitted by the card. When the ATM is no longer in use, the skimming device remains dormant, storing the stolen data in an encrypted format.</p>
<p>Dant and other investigators looking into the shimmers didn&#8217;t know at the time how the thieves who planted the devices went about gathering the stolen data. Traditional ATM skimmers are either retrieved manually, or they are programmed to transmit the stolen data wirelessly, such as via text message or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>But recall that these shimmers don&#8217;t have anywhere near the power needed to transmit data wirelessly, and the flexible shimmers themselves tend to rip apart when retrieved from the mouth of a compromised ATM. So how were the crooks collecting the loot?</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know how they were getting the PINs at the time, either,&#8221; Dant recalled. &#8220;We found out later they were combining the skimmers with old school cameras hidden in fake overhead and side panels on the ATMs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investigators wanted to look at the data stored on the shimmer, but it was encrypted. So they sent it to MasterCard&#8217;s forensics lab in the United Kingdom, and to the Secret Service.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Secret Service didn&#8217;t have any luck with it,&#8221; Dant said. &#8220;MasterCard in the U.K. was able to understand a little bit at a high level what it was doing, and they confirmed that it was powered by the chip. But the data dump from the shimmer was just encrypted gibberish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Organized crime gangs that specialize in deploying skimmers very often will encrypt stolen card data as a way to remove the possibility that any gang members might try to personally siphon and sell the card data in underground markets.</p>
<h2>THE DOWNLOAD CARDS</h2>
<p>Then in 2017, Dant got a lucky break: Investigators had found a shimming device inside an ATM in New York City, and that device appeared identical to the shimmers found in Mexico two years earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the first one that had showed up in the U.S. at that point,&#8221; Dant said.</p>
<p>The Citi team suspected that if they could work backwards from the card data that was known to have been recorded by the skimmers, they might be able to crack the encryption.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew when the shimmer went into the ATM, thanks to closed-circuit television footage,&#8221; Dant said. &#8220;And we know when that shimmer was discovered. So between that time period of a couple of days, these are the cards that interacted with the skimmer, and so these card numbers are most likely on this device.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based off that hunch, MasterCard&#8217;s eggheads had success decoding the encrypted gibberish. But they already knew which payment cards had been compromised, so what did investigators stand to gain from breaking the encryption?</p>
<p>According to Dant, this is where things got interesting: They found that the same primary account number (unique 16 digits of the card) was present on the download card and on the shimmers from both New York City and Mexican ATMs.</p>
<p>Further research revealed that account number was tied to a payment card issued years prior by an Austrian bank to a customer who reported never receiving the card in the mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;So why is this Austrian bank card number on the download card and two different shimming devices in two different countries, years apart?&#8221; Dant said he wondered at the time.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t have to wait long for an answer. Soon enough, the NYPD brought a case against a group of Romanian men suspected of planting the same shimming devices in both the U.S. and Mexico. Search warrants served against the Romanian defendants turned up multiple copies of the shimmer they&#8217;d seized from the compromised ATMs. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/06/how-cyber-sleuths-cracked-an-atm-shimmer-gang/#more-54583" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Amid multiple recent reports of hackers breaking into and tampering with drinking water treatment systems comes a new industry survey with some sobering findings: A majority of the 52,000 separate drinking water systems in the United States still haven&#8217;t inventoried some or any of their information technology systems &#8212; a basic first step in protecting networks from cyberattacks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-54338" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/drinkwatersupply.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="504" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sector-coordinating-councils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Sector Coordinating Council</a> surveyed roughly 600 employees of water and wastewater treatment facilities nationwide, and found 37.9 percent of utilities have identified all IT-networked assets, with an additional 21.7 percent working toward that goal.</p>
<p>The Council found when it comes to IT systems tied to &#8220;operational technology&#8221; (OT) &#8212; systems responsible for monitoring and controlling the industrial operation of these utilities and their safety features &#8212; just 30.5 percent had identified all OT-networked assets, with an additional 22.5 percent working to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Identifying IT and OT assets is a critical first step in improving cybersecurity,&#8221; the report concluded. &#8220;An organization cannot protect what it cannot see.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also hard to see threats you&#8217;re not looking for: 67.9 percent of water systems reported no IT security incidents in the last 12 months, a somewhat unlikely scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Arceneaux</strong>, managing director of the <a href="https://www.waterisac.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WaterISAC</a> &#8212; an industry group that tries to facilitate information sharing and the adoption of best practices among utilities in the water sector &#8212; said the survey shows much room for improvement and a need for support and resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Threats are increasing, and the sector, EPA, CISA and USDA need to collaborate to help utilities prevent and recover from compromises,&#8221; Arceneaux <a href="https://twitter.com/criticalh2o/status/1405638206301868032" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>While documenting each device that needs protection is a necessary first step, a number of recent cyberattacks on water treatment systems have been blamed on a failure to properly secure water treatment employee accounts that can be used for remote access.</p>
<p>In April, federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against a 22-year-old from Kansas who&#8217;s accused of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anx79/feds-indict-kansas-man-for-allegedly-hacking-into-water-supply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacking into a public water system in 2019</a>. The defendant in that case is a former employee of the water district he allegedly hacked.</p>
<p>In February, we learned that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/whats-most-interesting-about-the-florida-water-system-hack-that-we-heard-about-it-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">someone hacked into the water treatment plan in Oldsmar, Fla.</a> and briefly increased the amount of sodium hydroxide (a.k.a. lye used to control acidity in the water) to 100 times the normal level. That incident stemmed from stolen or leaked employee credentials for <strong>TeamViewer</strong>, a popular program that lets users remotely control their computers.</p>
<p>In January, a hacker tried to poison a water treatment plant that served parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hacker-tried-poison-calif-water-supply-was-easy-entering-password-rcna1206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> <strong>Kevin Collier</strong> for NBCNews. The hacker in that case also had the username and password for a former employee&#8217;s TeamViewer account. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/06/how-cyber-safe-is-your-drinking-water-supply/#more-56022" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In May 2019, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that the website of mortgage settlement giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_American_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First American Financial Corp.</a> [<a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FAF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSE:FAF</a>] was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/05/first-american-financial-corp-leaked-hundreds-of-millions-of-title-insurance-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaking more than 800 million documents</a> &#8212; many containing sensitive financial data &#8212; related to real estate transactions dating back 16 years. This week, the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> settled its investigation into the matter after the Fortune 500 company agreed to pay a paltry penalty of less than $500,000.</p>
<div id="attachment_47830" style="width: 995px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47830" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-47830" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/firstamericanfinancial.jpg" alt="" width="985" height="586" /><p id="caption-attachment-47830" class="wp-caption-text">First American Financial Corp.</p></div>
<p>If you bought or sold a property in the last two decades or so, chances are decent that you also gave loads of personal and financial documents to First American. According to <a href="https://www.alta.org/publications/press-release.cfm?ALTA-Reports-Title-Premium-Volume-Increases-217-Percent-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> from the <strong>American Land Title Association</strong>, First American is the second largest mortgage title and settlement company in the United States, handling nearly a quarter of all closings each year.</p>
<p>The SEC says First American derives nearly 92 percent of its revenue from its title insurance segment, earning $7.1 billion last year.</p>
<p>Title insurance protects homebuyers from the prospect of someone contesting their legitimacy as the new homeowner. According to <a href="https://www.simpleshowing.com/blog/who-pays-for-the-title-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SimpleShowing.com</a>, there are actually two title insurance policies in each transaction &#8212; one for the buyer and one for the lender (the latter also needs protection as they’re providing the mortgage to purchase the home).</p>
<p>Title insurance is not mandated by law, but most lenders require it as part of any mortgage transaction. In other words, if you wish to take out a mortgage on a home you will not be able to do so without giving companies like First American gobs of documents about your income, assets and liabilities &#8212; including quite a bit of sensitive financial data.</p>
<p>Aside from its core business competency &#8212; checking to make sure the property at issue in any real estate transaction is unencumbered by any liens or other legal claims against it &#8212; First American basically has one job: Protect the privacy and security of all these documents.</p>
<div id="attachment_47843" style="width: 767px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47843" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-47843" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sample-fa.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="619" /><p id="caption-attachment-47843" class="wp-caption-text">A redacted screenshot of one of many millions of sensitive records exposed by First American&#8217;s Web site.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why companies like First American might not view protecting this data as sacrosanct, as the entire industry&#8217;s incentive for safeguarding all those sensitive documents is somewhat misaligned.</p>
<p>That is to say, in the title insurance industry the parties to a real estate transaction aren&#8217;t customers, but rather <em>they are are the product</em>. The actual customers of the title insurance companies are principally the banks which back these mortgage transactions.</p>
<p>We see a similar dynamic with social media platforms, where the &#8220;user&#8221; is not the customer at all but the product whose data is being bought and sold by these platforms.</p>
<p>Roughly five months before KrebsOnSecurity notified First American that anyone with a web browser could view sensitive document in its &#8220;Eagle Pro&#8221; database online just by changing some characters at the end of a link, an internal security audit at First American flagged the exact same vulnerability.</p>
<p>But the company never acted to fix it until the news media came calling. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/06/first-american-financial-pays-farcical-500k-fine/#more-55971" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Authorities in Ukraine this week charged six people alleged to be part of the <strong>CLOP ransomware group</strong>, a cybercriminal gang said to have extorted more than half a billion dollars from victims. Some of CLOP&#8217;s victims this year alone include<strong> Stanford University Medical School</strong>, the <strong>University of California</strong>, and <strong>University of Maryland</strong>.</p>

<p>First debuting in early 2019, CLOP is one of several ransomware groups that hack into organizations, launch ransomware that encrypts files and servers, and then demand an extortion payment in return for a digital key needed to unlock access.</p>

<p>CLOP has been especially busy over the past six months exploiting four different zero-day vulnerabilities in <strong>File Transfer Appliance</strong> (FTA), a file sharing product made by California-based <a href="https://www.accellion.com/company/security-updates/mandiant-issues-final-report-regarding-accellion-fta-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accellion</a>.</p>
<p>The CLOP gang seized on those flaws <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/dewmode-accellion-supply-chain-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to deploy ransomware to a significant number of Accellion&#8217;s FTA customers</a>, including U.S. grocery chain <strong>Krogers</strong>, the law firm <strong>Jones Day</strong>, security firm <strong>Qualys</strong>, and the Singaporean telecom giant <strong>Singtel</strong>.</p>
<p>Last year, CLOP adopted the practice of attempting to extract a second ransom demand from victims in exchange for a promise not to publish or sell any stolen data. Terabytes of documents and files stolen from victim organizations that have not paid a data ransom are now available for download from CLOP&#8217;s deep web site, including Stanford, UCLA and the University of Maryland.</p>

												<p>The<strong> U.S. Department of Justice </strong>(DOJ) last week announced the arrest of a 55-year-old Latvian woman who&#8217;s alleged to have worked as a programmer for <strong>Trickbot</strong>, a malware-as-a-service platform responsible for infecting millions of computers and seeding many of those systems with ransomware.</p>
<p>Just how did a self-employed web site designer and mother of two come to work for one of the world&#8217;s most rapacious cybercriminal groups and then leave such an obvious trail of clues indicating her involvement with the gang? This post explores answers to those questions, as well as some of the ways Trickbot and other organized cybercrime gangs gradually recruit, groom and trust new programmers.</p>

<p>The DOJ alleges Witte was responsible for &#8220;overseeing the creation of code related to the monitoring and tracking of authorized users of the Trickbot malware, the control and deployment of ransomware, obtaining payments from ransomware victims, and developing tools and protocols for the storage of credentials stolen and exfiltrated from victims infected by Trickbot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The indictment also says Witte provided code to the Trickbot Group for a web panel used to access victim data stored in a database. According to the government, that database contained a large number of credit card numbers and stolen credentials from the Trickbot botnet, as well as information about infected machines available as bots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Witte provided code to this repository that showed an infected computer or &#8216;bot&#8217; status in different colors based on the colors of a traffic light and allowed other Trickbot Group members to know when their co-conspirators were working on a particular infected machine,&#8221; the indictment alleges.</p>
<p>While any law enforcement action against a crime group that has targeted hospitals, schools, public utilities and governments is good news, Witte&#8217;s indictment and arrest were probably inevitable: It is hard to think of an accused cybercriminal who has made more stunningly poor and rookie operational security mistakes than this Latvian senior citizen.</p>
<p>For starters, it appears at one point in 2020 Witte actually <a href="https://twitter.com/cybsecbot/status/1401588458666270722" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted Trickbot malware on a vanity website registered in her name</a> &#8212; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914053226/http://allawitte.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allawitte[.]nl</a>.</p>
<p>While it is generally a bad idea for cybercriminals to mix their personal life with work, Witte&#8217;s social media accounts mention a close family member (perhaps her son or husband) had the first name &#8220;Max,&#8221; which allegedly was her hacker handle.</p>
<p>Unlike many accused cybercriminals who hail from Russia or former Soviet countries, Witte did not feel obligated to avoid traveling to areas where she might be within reach of U.S. law enforcement agencies. According to her indictment, Witte was living in the South American nation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suriname</a> and she was arrested in Miami while flying from Suriname. It is not clear where her intended destination was.</p>
<div id="attachment_55950" style="width: 540px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55950" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-55950" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/coolprogrammer.png" alt="" width="530" height="162" /><p id="caption-attachment-55950" class="wp-caption-text">A Google-translated post Witte made to her Vkontakte page, five years before allegedly joining the Trickbot group.</p></div>
<p><strong>Alex Holden</strong>, founder of the cybersecurity intelligence firm Hold Security, said Witte&#8217;s greatest lapse in judgment came around Christmas time in 2019, when she infected one of her own computers with the Trickbot malware &#8212; allowing it to steal and log her data within the botnet interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;On top of the password re-use, the data shows a great insight into her professional and personal Internet usage,&#8221; Holden wrote in <a href="https://holdsecurity.com/news/2021/06/trickbot-gang-arrest-story-of-alla-witte/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post on Witte&#8217;s arrest</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many in the gang not only knew her gender but her name too,&#8221; Holden wrote. &#8220;Several group members had AllaWitte folders with data. They refer to Alla almost like they would address their mothers.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how did this hacker mom with apparently zero sense of self-preservation come to work for one of the world&#8217;s most predatory cybercriminal gangs? <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/06/how-does-one-get-hired-by-a-top-cybercrime-gang/#more-55911" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
