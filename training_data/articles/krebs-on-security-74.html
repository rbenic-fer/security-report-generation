												<p>KrebsOnSecurity received many a missive over the past 24 hours from readers who wanted to know why I&#8217;d not written about widespread media reports that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=mirai&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">Mirai</a> &#8212; a malware strain made from hacked &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices such as poorly secured routers and IP cameras &#8212; was used to knock the entire country of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia" target="_blank">Liberia</a> offline. The trouble is, as far as I can tell no such nationwide outage actually occurred.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap on Mirai: This blog was taken offline in September following <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/" target="_blank">a record 620 Gpbs attack</a> launched by a Mirai botnet. The source code for Mirai was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank">leaked online at the end of September</a>. Since then, the code has been forked several times, resulting in the emergence of several large Mirai-based botnets. In late October, many of the Internet&#8217;s top destinations went offline for the better part of a day when <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/" target="_blank">Mirai was used to attack</a> Internet infrastructure firm <strong>Dyn</strong>.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>Kevin Beaumont</strong>, a security architect from Liverpool, England who on Thursday published a <a href="https://medium.com/@networksecurity/shadows-kill-mirai-ddos-botnet-testing-large-scale-attacks-sending-threatening-messages-about-6a61553d1c7#.8fhmt3x4n" target="_blank">piece on Medium.com</a> about an attack by Mirai against Liberia. Beaumont had been researching the output of <a href="https://twitter.com/MiraiAttacks" target="_blank">an automated Twitter account</a> set up by security researchers to monitor attacks from these various Mirai botnets. That Twitter account, <strong>@MiraiAttacks</strong>, burps out a tweet with each new Mirai attack, listing the targeted Internet address, the attack type, and the observed duration of the attack.</p>
<p>Beamont&#8217;s story noted that a botnet based on Mirai was seen attacking the telecommunications infrastructure in the West African nation of Liberia. Citing anonymous sources, Beaumont said transit providers confirmed an attack of more than 500 Gpbs targeting Liberia&#8217;s lone underseas large-transit Internet cable, which Beaumont said &#8220;provides a single point of failure for internet access.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From monitoring we can see websites hosted in country going offline during the attacks,&#8221; Beaumont wrote. &#8220;Additionally, a source in country at a Telco has confirmed to a journalist they are seeing intermittent internet connectivity, at times which directly match the attack. The attacks are extremely worrying because they suggest a Mirai operator who has enough capacity to seriously impact systems in a nation state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not long after Beamont&#8217;s story went live, a piece at <a href="http://thehackernews.com/2016/11/ddos-attack-mirai-botnet.html" target="_blank">The Hacker News</a> breathlessly announced that hackers using Mirai had succeeded in knocking Liberia off the Internet. The Hacker News piece includes nifty graphics and images of Liberia&#8217;s underseas Internet cables. Soon after, <strong>ZDNet</strong> <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/mirai-botnet-attack-briefly-knocked-an-entire-country-offline/" target="_blank">picked up the outage angle</a>, as did <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37859678" target="_blank">the BBC</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/03/cyberattack-internet-liberia-ddos-hack-botnet" target="_blank">The Guardian</a> and a host of other news outlets.</p>
<div id="attachment_36893" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36893" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-36893" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hackernewsliberia-580x338.png" alt="A graphic The Hacker News used to explain Liberia's susceptibility to a DDoS attack. " width="580" height="338" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hackernewsliberia-580x338.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hackernewsliberia.png 735w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-36893" class="wp-caption-text">A graphic The Hacker News used to explain Liberia&#8217;s susceptibility to a DDoS attack.</p></div>
<p>The only problem that I can see with these stories is that there does not appear to have been anything close to a country-wide outage as a result of this Mirai attack.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Brewer</strong>, general manager for the <a href="http://cclnetwork.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Cable Consortium of Liberia</a>, confirmed that his organization has fielded inquiries from news outlets and other interest groups following multiple media reports of a nationwide outage. But he could not point to the reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both our ACE submarine cable monitoring systems and servers hosted (locally) in LIXP (Liberia Internet Exchange Point) show no downtime in the last 3 weeks,&#8221; Brewer said. &#8220;While it is likely that a local operator might have experienced a brief outage, we have no knowledge of a national Internet outage and there are no data to [substantiate] that.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/11/did-the-mirai-botnet-really-take-liberia-offline/#more-36884" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Way back in the last millennium when I was a lowly copy aide at <em>The Washington Post</em>, I pitched the Metro Section editor on an idea for new column: &#8220;And the Good News Is&#8230;&#8221; The editor laughed me out of her office. But I still think it&#8217;s a decent idea &#8212; particularly in the context of cybersecurity &#8212; to periodically highlight the good news when people allegedly responsible for spewing so much badness online are made to face justice.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom this week, 14 people were arrested on suspicion of laundering at least £11 million (~USD $13.7M) on behalf of thieves who stole the money using sophisticated banking Trojans like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dridex" target="_blank">Dridex</a> and <a href="https://www.secureworks.com/research/dyre-banking-trojan" target="_blank">Dyre</a>. A <a href="http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/948-nca-targets-international-cyber-crime-network" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the U.K.&#8217;s <strong>National Crime Agency</strong> (NCA) said 13 men and a woman, aged between 23 and 52, were arrested in the roundup, including a number of foreign nationals.</p>
<p>The NCA warned in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/cybercrime-overtakes-traditional-crime-in-uk/" target="_blank">a report</a> released this year that cybercrime had overtaken traditional crime in the United Kingdom. According to the <strong>U.K.&#8217;s Office of National Statistics</strong>, there were 2.46 million cyber incidents and 2.11 million victims of cybercrime in the U.K. in 2015.</p>
<p>Also in the U.K., 19-year-old <strong>Adam Mudd</strong> pleaded guilty to operating and profiting from <strong>Titanium Stresser,</strong> an attack-for-hire or &#8220;booter&#8221; service that could be hired to knock Web sites offline. When U.K. authorities arrested Mudd at his home last year, they found detailed records of the attack service&#8217;s customers and victims, which included evidence of more than 1.7 million attacks. Prosecutors say Mudd launched the service when he was 15 years old.</p>

<p>As I noted in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/lizard-kids-a-long-trail-of-fail/" target="_blank">this 2014 story</a>, the source code for Titanium Stresser was later used by miscreants with the <strong>Lizard Squad</strong> hacking group to power their <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/lizard-kids-a-long-trail-of-fail/" target="_blank">Lizard Stresser attack service</a>. Happily, two other 19-year-olds <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/feds-charge-two-in-lizard-squad-investigation/" target="_blank">were arrested earlier this month</a> and accused of operating the Lizard Stresser attack service. It&#8217;s nice to see authorities here and abroad sending a message that operating booter service can land you in jail, full stop. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/11/neer-do-well-news-and-cyber-justice/#more-36869" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Citing a computer virus outbreak, a hospital system in the United Kingdom has canceled all planned operations and diverted major trauma cases to neighboring facilities. The incident came as U.K. leaders detailed a national cyber security strategy that promises billions in cybersecurity spending, new special police units to pursue organized online gangs, and the possibility of retaliation for major attacks.</p>
<p>In a &#8220;major incident&#8221; alert posted to <a href="http://nlg.nhs.uk" target="_blank">its Web site</a>, the <strong>National Health Service&#8217;s Lincolnshire and Goole</strong> trust said it made the decision to cancel surgeries and divert trauma patients after a virus infected its electronic systems on Sunday, October 30.</p>
<div id="attachment_36858" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nhsalert.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36858" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-36858 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nhsalert-580x274.png" alt="A portion of an alert posted to the NHS's home page." width="580" height="274" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nhsalert-580x274.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nhsalert-768x363.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nhsalert-940x445.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36858" class="wp-caption-text">A portion of the alert posted to the NHS&#8217;s home page.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;We have taken the decision, following expert advise, to shut down the majority of our systems so we can isolate and destroy it,&#8221; the NHS said, of the unspecified malware infection. &#8220;All planned operations, outpatient appointments and diagnostic procedures have been cancelled for Wednesday, Nov. 2 with a small number of exceptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The advisory continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Inpatients will continue to be cared for and discharged as soon as they are medically fit. Major trauma cases will continue to be diverted to neighboring hospitals as will high risk women in labour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the NHS didn&#8217;t say what kind of virus infected its systems, it is likely an infestation of ransomware &#8212; a malware scourge whose purveyors have taken to targeting hospitals and healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>Ransomware scours an infected computer for documents, audio files, pictures and other things likely to be of value to the system&#8217;s owner, and then encrypts that data with very powerful encryption software. Most ransomware variants also scour the local network for other systems or network shares to infect. Victims usually can only get their files back after paying a specified ransom demand using a virtual currency, such as Bitcoin. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/11/computer-virus-cripples-uk-hospital-system/#more-36854" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Perhaps the most bustling marketplace on the Internet where people can compare and purchase so-called &#8220;booter&#8221; and &#8220;stresser&#8221; subscriptions &#8212; attack-for-hire services designed to knock Web sites offline &#8212; announced last week that it has permanently banned the sale and advertising of these services.</p>
<p>On Friday, Oct. 28, <strong>Jesse LaBrocca </strong>&#8212; the administrator of the popular English-language hacking forum <strong>Hackforums[dot]net</strong> &#8212; said he was shutting down the &#8220;server stress testing&#8221; (SST) section of the forum. The move comes amid heightened public scrutiny of the SST industry, which has been <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/israeli-online-attack-service-vdos-earned-600000-in-two-years/" target="_blank">linked</a> to several unusually powerful recent attacks and is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/are-the-days-of-booter-services-numbered/" target="_blank">responsible for the vast majority of denial-of-service (DOS) attacks</a> on the Internet today.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately once again the few ruin it for the many,&#8221; LaBrocca wrote under his Hackforums alias &#8220;Omniscient.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m personally disappointed that this is the path I have to take in order to protect the community. I loathe having to censor material that could be beneficial to members. But I need to make sure that we continue to exist and given the recent events I think it&#8217;s more important that the section be permanently shut down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/" target="_blank">a record-sized DDoS</a> hit KrebsOnSecurity.com. The attack was launched with the help of <strong>Mirai</strong>, a malware strain that enslaves <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/who-makes-the-iot-things-under-attack/" target="_blank">poorly secured Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices</a> like CCTV cameras and digital video recorders and uses them to launch crippling attacks.</p>
<p>At the end of September, a Hackforums user named &#8220;<strong>Anna_Senpai</strong>&#8221; used the forum <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank">to announce the release the source code for Mirai</a>. A week ago, someone <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/" target="_blank">used Mirai</a> to launch <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/" target="_blank">a massive attack on Internet infrastructure firm <strong>Dyn</strong></a>, which for the better part of a day lead to sporadic outages for some of the Web&#8217;s top destinations, including <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>, <strong>Reddit</strong> and <strong>Netflix</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_36550" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mirai-hf.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36550" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-36550 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mirai-hf-580x232.png" alt="The Hackforums post that includes links to the Mirai source code." width="580" height="232" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mirai-hf-580x232.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mirai-hf-768x308.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mirai-hf-940x377.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mirai-hf.png 1956w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36550" class="wp-caption-text">The Hackforums post that includes links to the Mirai source code.</p></div>
<p>As I noted in last week&#8217;s story <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/are-the-days-of-booter-services-numbered/" target="_blank">Are the Days of Booter Services Numbered?</a>, many booter service owners have been operating under the delusion or rationalization that their services are intended solely for Web site owners to test the ability of their sites to withstand data deluges.</p>
<p>Whatever illusions booter service operators or users may have harbored about their activities should have been dispelled following a talk delivered at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas this year. In that speech, <strong>FBI Agent Elliott Peterson</strong> issued an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Lu8kPiX6E" target="_blank">unambiguous warning</a> that the agency was prepared to investigate and help prosecute people engaged in selling and buying from booter services.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t until this month&#8217;s attack on Dyn that LaBrocca warned the Hackforums community he may have to shut down the SST section.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t image this attention is going to be a good thing,&#8221; Omni said in an October 26, 2016 thread titled &#8220;Bad things.&#8221; &#8220;Already a Senator is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/senator-prods-federal-agencies-on-iot-mess/" target="_blank">calling for a hearing</a> on the Internet of Things [link added]. In the end there could be new laws which effect [sic] us all. So for those responsible for the attacks and creating this mess&#8230;.you dun goofed. I expect a lot of backlash to come out of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>If LaBrocca appears steamed from this turn of events, it&#8217;s probably with good reason: He stands to lose a fair amount of regular income by banning some of the most lucrative businesses on his forum. Vendors on Hackforums pay fees as high as $25 apiece to achieve a status that allows them to post new sales threads, and banner ads on the forum can run up to $200 per week.</p>
<div id="attachment_36841" style="width: 311px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/booterstickies.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36841" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-36841" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/booterstickies.png" alt="&quot;Stickies&quot; advertising various &quot;booter&quot; or &quot;stresser&quot; DDoS-for-hire services." width="301" height="223" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-36841" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Stickies&#8221; advertising various &#8220;booter&#8221; or &#8220;stresser&#8221; DDoS-for-hire services.</p></div>
<p>Vendors who wish to &#8220;sticky&#8221; their ads &#8212; that is, pay to keep the ads displayed prominently near or at the top of a given discussion subforum &#8212; pay LaBrocca up to $60 per week for the prime sticky spots. And there were dozens of booter services advertised on Hackforums.</p>
<p><strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, director of security research at <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/" target="_blank">Flashpoint</a> and an expert on booter services, said the move could put many booter services out of business.</p>
<p>Nixon said the average booter service customer uses the attack services to settle grudges with opponents in online games, and that the closure of the SST subforum may make these services less attractive to those individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is probably a lesser likelihood that the average gamer will see these services and think that it’s an okay idea to purchase them,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;The ease of access to these booters services makes people think it’s okay to use them. In gaming circles, for example, people will often use them to DDoS one another and not realize they might be shutting down an innocent person’s network. Recognizing that this is criminal activity on the same level of criminal hacking and fraud may discourage people from using these services, meaning the casual actor may be less likely to buy a booter subscription and launch DDoS attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>While a welcome development, the closure of the SST subforum almost seems somewhat arbitrary given the sheer amount of other illegal hacking activity that is blatantly advertised on Hackforums, Nixon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s interesting the norms that are on this forum because they’re so different from how you or I would recognize acceptable behavior,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For example, most people would think it’s not acceptable to see booter services advertised alongside <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/canadian-man-is-author-of-popular-orcus-rat/" target="_blank">remote access Trojans</a>, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/antivirus-is-dead-long-live-antivirus/" target="_blank">malware crypting services</a> and botnets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other questionable services and subsections advertised on Hackforums include those intended for the sale of hacked social media and e-commerce accounts. More shocking are the dozens of threads wherein Hackforums members advertise the sale of &#8220;girl slaves,&#8221; essentially access to hacked computers belonging to teenage girls who can be extorted and exploited for payment or naked pictures. It&#8217;s worth noting that the youth who was arrested for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/miss-teen-usas-webcam-spy-called-himself-cutefuzzypuppy/" target="_blank">snapping nude pictures of Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf</a> through her webcam was a regular user of Hackforums.</p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>It may soon become easier for Internet service providers to anticipate and block certain types of online assaults launched by Web-based attack-for-hire services known as <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=booter&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">&#8220;booter&#8221; or &#8220;stresser&#8221;</a> services, new research released today suggests.</p>
<p>The findings come from researchers in Germany who&#8217;ve been studying patterns that emerge when miscreants attempt to mass-scan the entire Internet looking for systems useful for launching these digital sieges &#8212; known as &#8220;distributed denial-of-service&#8221; or DDoS attacks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-36825" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ddosbomb-580x357.png" alt="ddosbomb" width="580" height="357" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ddosbomb-580x357.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ddosbomb.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>To understand the significance of their research, it may help to briefly examine how DDoS attacks have evolved. Not long ago, if one wanted to take down large Web site, one had to build and maintain a large robot network, or &#8220;botnet,&#8221; of hacked computers &#8212; which is a fairly time intensive, risky and technical endeavor.</p>
<p>These days, however, even the least sophisticated Internet user can launch relatively large DDoS attacks just by paying a few bucks for a subscription to one of dozens of booter or stresser services, some of which <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/israeli-online-attack-service-vdos-earned-600000-in-two-years/" target="_blank">even accept credit cards and PayPal payments</a>.</p>
<p>These Web-based DDoS-for-hire services don&#8217;t run on botnets: They generally employ a handful of powerful servers that are rented from some dodgy <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/11/body-armor-for-bad-web-sites/" target="_blank">&#8220;bulletproof&#8221; hosting provider</a>. The booter service accepts payment and attack instructions via a front end Web site that is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/01/spreading-the-disease-and-selling-the-cure/" target="_blank">hidden behind Cloudflare</a> (a free DDoS protection service).</p>
<p>But the back end of the booter service is where the really interesting stuff happens. Virtually all of the most powerful and effective attack types used by booter services rely on a technique called traffic <strong>amplification</strong> and <strong>reflection</strong>, in which the attacker can reflect or &#8220;spoof&#8221; his traffic from one or more third-party machines toward the intended target.</p>
<p>In this type of assault, the attacker sends a message to a third party, while spoofing the Internet address of the victim. When the third party replies to the message, the reply is sent to the victim — and the reply is much larger than the original message, thereby amplifying the size of the attack.</p>
<p>To find vulnerable systems that can be leveraged this way, booters employ large-scale Internet scanning services that constantly seek to refresh the list of systems that can be used for amplification and reflection attacks. They do this because, as <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-kuhrer.pdf" target="_blank">research has shown</a> (PDF), anywhere from 40-50 percent of the amplifiers vanish or are reassigned new Internet addresses after one week.</p>
<p>Enter researchers from <strong>Saarland University</strong> in Germany, as well as the <strong>Yokohama National University</strong> and <strong>National Institute of Information and Communications Technology</strong> &#8212; both in Japan. In a years-long project first detailed in 2015, the researchers looked for scanning that appeared to be kicked off by ne&#8217;er-do-wells running booter services.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, the research team built a kind of distributed &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)" target="_blank">honeypot</a>&#8221; system &#8212; which they dubbed &#8220;<strong>AmpPot</strong>&#8221; &#8212; designed to mimic services known to be vulnerable to amplification attacks, such as <a href="https://www.incapsula.com/ddos/attack-glossary/dns-flood.html" target="_blank">DNS</a> and <a href="https://www.incapsula.com/ddos/attack-glossary/ntp-amplification.html" target="_blank">NTP</a> floods.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make them attractive to attackers, our honeypots send back legitimate responses,&#8221; the researchers wrote in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amppot-raid2015.Brian_.pdf" target="_blank">a 2015 paper</a> (PDF). &#8220;Attackers, in turn, will abuse these honeypots as amplifiers, which allows us to observe ongoing attacks, their victims, and the DDoS techniques. To prevent damage caused by our honeypots, we limit the response rate. This way, while attackers can still find these ratelimited honeypots, the honeypots stop replying in the face of attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that 2015 paper, the researchers said they deployed 21 globally-distributed AmpPot instances, which observed more than 1.5 million attacks between February and May 2015. Analyzing the attacks more closely, they found that more than 96% of the attacks stem from single sources, such as booter services.</p>
<p>&#8220;When focusing on amplification DDoS attacks, we find that almost all of them (&gt;96%) are caused by single sources (e.g. booters), and not botnets,&#8221; the team concluded. &#8220;However, we sadly do not have the numbers to compare this [to] DoS attacks in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many large-scale Internet scans like the ones the researchers sought to measure are launched by security firms and other researchers, so the team needed a way to differentiate between scans launched by booter services and those conducted for research or other benign purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;To distinguish between scans performed by researchers and scans performed with malicious intent we relied on a simple assumption: That no attack would be based on the results of a scan performed by (ethical) researchers,&#8221; said <strong>Johannes Krupp</strong>, one of the main authors of the report. &#8220;In fact, thanks to our methodology, we do not have to make this distinction upfront, but we can rather look at the results and say: &#8216;We found attacks linked to this scanner, therefore this scanner must have been malicious.&#8217; If a scan was truly performed by benign parties, we will not find attacks linked to it.&#8221;</p>
<h4>SECRET IDENTIFIERS</h4>
<p>What&#8217;s new in the paper being released today by students at Saarland University&#8217;s <a href="https://cispa.saarland/index.html" target="_blank">Center for IT-Security, Privacy and Accountability</a> (CISPA) is the method by which the researchers were able to link these mass-scans to the very amplification attacks that follow soon after.</p>
<p>The researchers worked out a way to encode a secret identifier into the set of AmpPot honeypots that any subsequent attack will use, which varies per scan source. They then tested to see if the scan infrastructure was also used to actually launch (and not just to prepare) the attacks. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/are-the-days-of-booter-services-numbered/#more-36687" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The co-founder of the newly launched <a href="http://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=6232F6A3-DC2D-444C-AEE5-C891511D4286" target="_blank">Senate Cybersecurity Caucus</a> is pushing federal agencies for possible solutions and responses to the security threat from insecure &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices, such as the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/" target="_blank">network of hacked security cameras and digital video recorders</a> that were reportedly used to help bring about <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/" target="_blank">last Friday&#8217;s major Internet outages</a>.</p>
<p>In letters to the <strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong> (FCC), the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> (FTC) and the <strong>Department of Homeland Security</strong> (DHS), <strong>Virginia Senator Mark Warner</strong> (D) called the proliferation of insecure IoT devices a threat to resiliency of the Internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manufacturers today are flooding the market with cheap, insecure devices, with few market incentives to design the products with security in mind, or to provide ongoing support,&#8221; Warner wrote to the agencies. &#8220;And buyers seem unable to make informed decisions between products based on their competing security features, in part because there are no clear metrics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter continues:</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the producers of these insecure IoT devices currently are insulated from any standards requirements, market feedback, or liability concerns, I am deeply concerned that <span class="pullquote pqleft">we are witnessing a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" target="_blank">tragedy of the commons</a>’ threat to the continued functioning of the internet, as the security so vital to all internet users remains the responsibility of none.</span> Further, buyers have little recourse when, despite their best efforts, security failures occur&#8221; [link added].</p>
<p>As Warner&#8217;s letter notes, last week’s attack on online infrastructure provider <strong>Dyn</strong> was launched at least in part by <strong>Mirai</strong>, a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank">now open-source</a> malware strain that scans the Internet for routers, cameras, digital video recorders and other Internet of Things “IoT” devices protected only by the factory-default passwords. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/senator-prods-federal-agencies-on-iot-mess/#more-36785" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A Chinese electronics firm pegged by experts as responsible for making many of the components leveraged in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/">last week&#8217;s massive attack</a> that disrupted Twitter and dozens of popular Web sites has vowed to recall some of its vulnerable products, even as it threatened legal action against this publication and others for allegedly tarnishing the company&#8217;s brand.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36433" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/iotstuf.jpg" alt="iotstuf" width="500" height="282" /></p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s attack on online infrastructure provider <strong>Dyn</strong> was launched at least in part by <strong>Mirai</strong>, a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank">now open-source</a> malware strain that scans the Internet for routers, cameras, digital video recorders and other Internet of Things &#8220;IoT&#8221; devices protected only by the factory-default passwords. Once infected with Mirai, the IoT systems can be used to flood a target with so much junk Web traffic that the target site can no longer accommodate legitimate users or visitors.</p>
<p>In an interim report on the attack, Dyn said: &#8220;We can confirm, with the help of analysis from <strong>Flashpoint</strong> and <strong>Akamai</strong>, that one source of the traffic for the attacks were devices infected by the Mirai botnet. We observed 10s of millions of discrete IP addresses associated with the Mirai botnet that were part of the attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result of that attack, one of the most-read stories on KrebsOnSecurity so far this year is &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/who-makes-the-iot-things-under-attack/" target="_blank">Who Makes the IoT Things Under Attack?</a>&#8220;, in which I tried to match default passwords sought out by the Mirai malware with IoT hardware devices for sale on the commercial market today.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/europe-to-push-new-security-rules-amid-iot-mess/" target="_blank">follow-up to that story</a>, I interviewed researchers at Flashpoint who discovered that one of the default passwords sought by machines infected with Mirai — username: root and password: <strong>xc3511</strong> — is embedded in a broad array of white-labeled DVR and IP camera electronics boards made by a Chinese company called <strong>XiongMai Technologies</strong>. These components are sold downstream to vendors who then use them in their own products.</p>
<p>The scary part about IoT products that include <a href="http://www.xiongmaitech.com/en/index.php/product" target="_blank">XiongMai&#8217;s various electronics components</a>, Flashpoint found, was that while users could change the default credentials in the devices&#8217; Web-based administration panel, the password is hardcoded into the device firmware and the tools needed to disable it aren&#8217;t present.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4MDQ4NjMwOA==&amp;mid=2651450911&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=f4d41b6fae77ece8493fdec1197d97f0&amp;chksm=845ec4d4b3294dc23df1d6ecba1e76ccec9ac6533aef4403ecf34f9b72e4cb3c7c94e57dfc89&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1024DskPGO5o4Jgp1qYNtrDZ#wechat_redirect" target="_blank">a statement</a> issued on social media Monday, XiongMai (referring to itself as &#8220;XM&#8221;) said it would be issuing a recall on millions of devices &#8212; mainly network cameras.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote pqleft">&#8220;Mirai is a huge disaster for the Internet of Things,&#8221; the company said in a separate statement emailed to journalists. &#8220;XM have to admit that our products also suffered from hacker&#8217;s break-in and illegal use.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>At the same time, the Chinese electronics firm said that in September 2015 it issued a firmware fix for vulnerable devices, and that XiongMai hardware shipped after that date should not by default be vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since then, XM has set the device default Telnet off to avoid the hackers to connect,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;In other words, this problem is absent at the moment for our devices after Sep 2015, as Hacker cannot use the Telnet to access our devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the default user name/password that ships with XM, &#8220;our devices are asking customers to change the default password when they first time to login,&#8221; the electronics maker wrote. &#8220;When customer power on the devices, the first step, is change the default password.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working with some researchers who are testing XM&#8217;s claims, and will post an update here if and when that research is available. In the meantime, XM is <a href="http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4MDQ4NjMwOA==&amp;mid=2651450911&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=f4d41b6fae77ece8493fdec1197d97f0&amp;chksm=845ec4d4b3294dc23df1d6ecba1e76ccec9ac6533aef4403ecf34f9b72e4cb3c7c94e57dfc89&amp;mpshare=1&amp;scene=1&amp;srcid=1024DskPGO5o4Jgp1qYNtrDZ#wechat_redirect" target="_blank">threatening legal action</a> against media outlets that it says are issuing &#8220;false statements&#8221; against the company.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s translation of their statement reads, in part: &#8220;Organizations or individuals false statements, defame our goodwill behavior &#8230; through legal channels to pursue full legal responsibility for all violations of people, to pursue our legal rights are reserved.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/iot-device-maker-vows-product-recall-legal-action-against-western-accusers/#more-36765" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A massive and sustained Internet attack that has caused outages and network congestion today for a large number of Web sites was launched with the help of hacked &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices, such as CCTV video cameras and digital video recorders, new data suggests.</p>
<p>Earlier today cyber criminals began training their attack cannons on <strong>Dyn</strong>, an Internet infrastructure company that provides critical technology services to some of the Internet&#8217;s top destinations. The attack began creating problems for Internet users reaching an array of sites, including Twitter, Amazon, Tumblr, Reddit, Spotify and Netflix.</p>
<div id="attachment_36755" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36755" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-36755 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png" alt="l3outage" width="580" height="330" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-36755" class="wp-caption-text">A depiction of the outages caused by today&#8217;s attacks on Dyn, an Internet infrastructure company. Source: Downdetector.com.</p></div>
<p>At first, it was unclear who or what was behind the attack on Dyn. But over the past few hours, at least one computer security firm has come out saying the attack involved <strong>Mirai</strong>, the same malware strain that was used in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/" target="_blank">the record 620 Gpbs attack on my site last month</a>. At the end September 2016, the hacker responsible for creating the Mirai malware <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank">released the source code for it</a>, effectively letting anyone build their own attack army using Mirai.</p>
<p>Mirai scours the Web for IoT devices protected by little more than factory-default usernames and passwords, and then enlists the devices in attacks that hurl junk traffic at an online target until it can no longer accommodate legitimate visitors or users.</p>
<p>According to researchers at security firm <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/" target="_blank">Flashpoint</a>, today&#8217;s attack was launched at least in part by a Mirai-based botnet. <strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, director of research at Flashpoint, said the botnet used in today&#8217;s ongoing attack is built on the backs of hacked IoT devices &#8212; mainly compromised digital video recorders (DVRs) and IP cameras made by a Chinese hi-tech company called <strong>XiongMai Technologies</strong>. The components that XiongMai makes are sold downstream to vendors who then use it in their own products.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s remarkable that virtually an entire company&#8217;s product line has just been turned into a botnet that is now attacking the United States,&#8221; Nixon said, noting that Flashpoint hasn&#8217;t ruled out the possibility of multiple botnets being involved in the attack on Dyn.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least one Mirai [control server] issued an attack command to hit Dyn,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;Some people are theorizing that there were multiple botnets involved here. What we can say is that we&#8217;ve seen a Mirai botnet participating in the attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I noted earlier this month in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/europe-to-push-new-security-rules-amid-iot-mess/" target="_blank">Europe to Push New Security Rules Amid IoT Mess</a>, many of these products from XiongMai and other makers of inexpensive, mass-produced IoT devices are essentially unfixable, and will remain a danger to others unless and until they are completely unplugged from the Internet. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/#more-36754" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Criminals this morning massively attacked <a href="http://www.dyn.com" target="_blank">Dyn</a>, a company that provides core Internet services for Twitter, SoundCloud, Spotify, Reddit and a host of other sites, causing outages and slowness for many of Dyn&#8217;s customers.</p>
<div id="attachment_36729" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36729" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-36729" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/twitterapi-580x48.png" alt="Twitter is experiencing problems, as seen through the social media platform Hootsuite.

<p>In a statement, Dyn said that this morning, October 21, Dyn received a global <strong>distributed denial of service</strong> (DDoS) attack on its DNS infrastructure on the east coast starting at around 7:10 a.m. ET (11:10 UTC).</p>
<p>&#8220;DNS traffic resolved from east coast name server locations are experiencing a service interruption during this time. Updates will be posted as information becomes available,&#8221; the company wrote.</p>
<p>DYN encouraged customers with concerns to check the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dynstatus.com/" target="_blank">status page</a> for updates and to reach out to its technical support team.</p>
<p>A DDoS is when crooks use a large number of hacked or ill-configured systems to flood a target site with so much junk traffic that it can no longer serve legitimate visitors.</p>
<p>DNS refers to <strong>Domain Name System</strong> services. DNS is an essential component of all Web sites, responsible for translating human-friendly Web site names like “example.com” into numeric, machine-readable Internet addresses. Anytime you send an e-mail or browse a Web site, your machine is sending a DNS look-up request to your Internet service provider to help route the traffic.</p>
<h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>The attack on DYN comes just hours after DYN researcher <strong>Doug Madory</strong> presented a talk on DDoS attacks in Dallas, Texas at a meeting of the North American Network Operators Group (NANOG). Madory&#8217;s talk &#8212; available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFJzu0AFDpU" target="_blank">here on Youtube.com</a> &#8212; delved deeper into research that he and I teamed up on to produce the data behind the story <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/ddos-mitigation-firm-has-history-of-hijacks/" target="_blank">DDoS Mitigation Firm Has History of Hijacks</a>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/#more-36727" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>Earlier this month a hacker <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank">released the source code</a> for <b>Mirai</b>, a malware strain that was used to launch <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/" target="_blank">a historically large</a> 620 Gbps denial-of-service attack against this site in September. That attack came in apparent retribution for a story here which directly preceded the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/alleged-vdos-proprietors-arrested-in-israel/" target="_blank">arrest of two Israeli men</a> for allegedly <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/israeli-online-attack-service-vdos-earned-600000-in-two-years/" target="_blank">running an online attack for hire service called vDOS</a>. Turns out, the site where the Mirai source code was leaked had some very interesting things in common with the place vDOS called home.</p>
<p>The domain name where the Mirai source code was originally placed for download &#8212; <strong>santasbigcandycane[dot]cx</strong> &#8212; is registered at the same domain name registrar that was used to register the now-defunct DDoS-for-hire service <strong>vdos-s[dot]com</strong>.</p>
<p>Normally, this would not be remarkable, since most domain registrars have thousands or millions of domains in their stable. But in this case it is interesting mainly because the registrar used by both domains &#8212; a company called <strong>namecentral.com</strong> &#8212; <em>has apparently been used to register just 38 domains since its inception by its current owner in 2012</em>, according to a historic WHOIS records gathered by <a href="http://www.domaintools.com" target="_blank">domaintools.com</a> (for the full list see <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/namecentraldomains.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF</a>).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, a cursory look at the other domains registered via namecentral.com since then reveals a number of other DDoS-for-hire services, also known as &#8220;booter&#8221; or &#8220;stresser&#8221; services.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s extremely odd that someone would take on the considerable cost and trouble of creating a domain name registrar just to register a few dozen domains. It costs $3,500 to apply to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN" target="_blank">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (ICANN) for <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/financials-55-2012-02-25-en" target="_blank">a new registrar authority</a>. The annual fee for being an ICANN-approved registrar is $4,000, and then there&#8217;s a $800 quarterly fee for smaller registrars. In short, domain name registrars generally need to register many thousands of new domains each year just to turn a profit.</p>
<p>Many of the remaining three dozen or so domains registered via Namecentral over the past few years are tied to vDOS. Before vDOS was taken offline it was massively hacked, and a copy of the user and attack database was shared with KrebsOnSecurity. From those records it was easy to tell which third-party booter services were using vDOS&#8217;s application programming interface (API), a software function that allowed them to essentially resell access to vDOS with their own white-labeled stresser.</p>
<p>And a number of those vDOS resellers were registered through Namecentral, including <strong>83144692[dot].com</strong> &#8212; a DDoS-for-hire service marketed at Chinese customers. Another Namecentral domain &#8212; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I3mo8Ug4sE" target="_blank">vstress.net</a> &#8212; also was a vDOS reseller.</p>
<p>Other DDoS-for-hire domains registered through Namecentral include <strong>xboot[dot]net</strong>, <a href="http://archive.is/zx84l" target="_blank">xr8edstresser[dot]com</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/jsRkL" target="_blank">snowstresser[dot]com</a>, <strong>ezstress[dot]com</strong>, <strong>exilestress[dot]com</strong>, <strong>diamondstresser[dot]net</strong>, <strong>dd0s[dot]pw</strong>, <strong>rebelsecurity[dot]net</strong>, and <strong>beststressers[dot]com</strong>.</p>
<h4>WHO RUNS NAMECENTRAL?</h4>
<p>Namecentral&#8217;s current owner is a 19-year-old California man by the name of <strong>Jesse Wu. </strong>Responding to questions emailed from KrebsOnSecurity, Wu said Namecentral&#8217;s policy on abuse was inspired by <strong>Cloudflare</strong>, the DDoS protection company that guards Namecentral and most of the above-mentioned DDoS-for-hire sites from attacks of the very kind they sell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure (since registrations are automated) but I&#8217;m going to guess that the reason you&#8217;re interested in us is because some stories you&#8217;ve written in the past had domains registered on our service or otherwise used one of our services,&#8221; Wu wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a policy inspired by Cloudflare&#8217;s similar policy that we ourselves will remain content-neutral and in the support of an open Internet, we will almost never remove a registration or stop providing services, and furthermore we&#8217;ll take any effort to ensure that registrations cannot be influenced by anyone besides the actual registrant making a change themselves &#8211; even if such website makes us uncomfortable,&#8221; Wu said. &#8220;However, as a US based company, we are held to US laws, and so if we receive a valid court issued order to stop providing services to a client, or to turn over/disable a domain, we would happily comply with such order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wu&#8217;s message continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;As of this email, we have never received such an order, we have never been contacted by any law enforcement agency, and we have never even received a legitimate, credible abuse report. We realize this policy might make us popular with &#8216;dangerous&#8217; websites but even then, if we denied them services, simply not providing them services would not make such website stop existing, they would just have to find some other service provider/registrar or change domains more often. Our services themselves cannot be used for anything harmful &#8211; a domain is just a string of letters, and the rest of our services involve website/ddos protection/ecommerce security services designed to protect websites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking a page from Cloudflare, indeed. I&#8217;ve long <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=cloudflare+booter&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">taken Cloudflare to task</a> for granting DDoS protection for countless DDoS-for-hire services, to no avail. I&#8217;ve maintained that Cloudflare has a blatant conflict of interest here, and that the DDoS-for-hire industry would quickly blast itself into oblivion because the proprietors of these attack services like nothing more than to turn their attack cannons on each other. Cloudflare has steadfastly maintained that picking and choosing who gets to use their network is <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/thoughts-on-abuse" target="_blank">a slippery slope</a> that it will not venture toward.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Wu says he had nothing to do with the domains registered through Namecentral, public records filed elsewhere raise serious unanswered questions about that claim.</p>
<p>In my Sept. 8 story, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/israeli-online-attack-service-vdos-earned-600000-in-two-years/" target="_blank">Israeli Online Attack Service Earned $600,000 in Two Years</a>, I explained that the hacked vDOS database indicated the service was run by two 18-year-old Israeli men. At some point, vDOS decided to protect all customer logins to the service with an extended validation (EV) SSL certificate. And for that, it needed to show it was tied to an actual corporate entity.</p>
<p>My investigation into those responsible for supporting vDOS began after I took a closer look at the SSL certificate that vDOS-S[dot]com used to encrypt customer logins. On May 12, 2015, <strong>Digicert.com</strong> issued an EV SSL certificate for vDOS, according to <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=7475563" target="_blank">this record</a>.</p>
<p>As we can see, whoever registered that EV cert did so using the business name <strong>VS NETWORK SERVICES LTD</strong>, and giving an address in the United Kingdom of 217 Blossomfield Rd., Solihull, West Midlands.</p>
<p>Who owns VS NETWORK SERVICES LTD? According <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/EDfEVA0w04RNAIZXte7hKVk4550/appointments" target="_blank">this record</a> from <strong>Companies House UK</strong> &#8212; an official ledger of corporations located in the United Kingdom &#8212; the director of the company was listed as one <strong>Thomas McGonagall. </strong></p>
<div id="attachment_36713" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36713" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-36713" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vsn-companieshouse-580x349.png" alt="Records from Companies House UK on the firm responsible for registering vDOS's SSL certificate." width="580" height="349" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vsn-companieshouse-580x349.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vsn-companieshouse-768x462.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vsn-companieshouse-940x566.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vsn-companieshouse.png 1002w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-36713" class="wp-caption-text">Records from Companies House UK on the firm responsible for registering vDOS&#8217;s SSL certificate.</p></div>
<p>This individual gave the same West Midlands address, stating that he was appointed to VS Network Services on May 12, 2015, and that his birthday was in May 1988. A search in Companies House for Thomas McGonagall shows that a person by that same name and address <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09642105/officers" target="_blank">also was listed</a> that very same day as a director for a company called <strong>REBELSECURITY LTD</strong>.</p>
<p>If we go back even further into the corporate history of this mysterious Mr. McGonagall we find that he <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09179511/officers" target="_blank">was appointed director of NAMECENTRAL LTD</a> on August 18, 2014. Mr. McGonagall&#8217;s birthday is listed as December 1995 in this record, and his address is given as 29 Wigorn Road, 29 Wigorn Road, Smethwick, West Midlands, United Kingdom, B67 5HL. Also on that same day, he was <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09179227/officers" target="_blank">appointed</a> to run <strong>EZSTRESS LTD,</strong> a company at the same Smethwick, West Midlands address.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, those company names correspond to other domains registered through Namecentral around the same time the companies were created, including rebelsecurity[dot]net, ezstress[dot]net.</p>
<p>Asked to explain the odd apparent corporate connections between Namecentral, vDOS, EZStress and Rebelsecurity, Wu chalked that up to an imposter or potential phishing attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure who that is, and we are not affiliated with Namecentral Ltd.,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I looked it up though and it seems like it is either closed or has never been active. From what you described it could be possible someone set up shell companies to try and get/resell EV certs (and someone&#8217;s failed attempt to set up a phishing site for us &#8211; thanks for the heads up).&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, among the three dozen or so domains registered through Namecentral.com is &#8220;certificateavenue.com,&#8221; a site that until recently included nearly identical content as Namecentral&#8217;s home page and appears to be aimed at selling EV certs. Certificateavenue.com was <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4QrzL3tNZ24J:certificateavenue.com/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" target="_blank">responding</a> as of early-October, but it is no longer online.</p>
<p>I also asked Wu why he chose to become a domain registrar when it appeared he had very few domains to justify the substantial annual costs of maintaining a registrar business. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/spreading-the-ddos-disease-and-selling-the-cure/#more-36538" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
