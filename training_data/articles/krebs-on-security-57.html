												<p>The <strong>U.S. Justice Department</strong> on Tuesday unsealed the guilty pleas of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two men first identified in January 2017</a> by KrebsOnSecurity as the likely co-authors of <strong>Mirai</strong>, a malware strain that remotely enslaves so-called &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; devices such as security cameras, routers, and digital video recorders for use in large scale attacks designed to knock Web sites and entire networks offline (including multiple major attacks against this site).</p>
<p>Entering guilty pleas for their roles in developing and using Mirai are 21-year-old <strong>Paras Jha</strong> from Fanwood, N.J. and <strong>Josiah White</strong>, 20, from Washington, Pennsylvania.<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-41822" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/parasjhalinkedin.png" alt="" width="580" height="295" /></p>
<p>Jha and White were co-founders of <strong>Protraf Solutions LLC</strong>, a company that specialized in mitigating large-scale DDoS attacks. Like firemen getting paid to put out the fires they started, Jha and White would target organizations with DDoS attacks and then either extort them for money to call off the attacks, or try to sell those companies services they claimed could uniquely help fend off the attacks.</p>
<h4>CLICK FRAUD BOTNET</h4>
<p>In addition, the Mirai co-creators pleaded guilty to charges of using their botnet to conduct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click fraud</a> &#8212; a form of online advertising fraud that will cost Internet advertisers more than $16 billion this year, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/15/businesses-could-lose-164-billion-to-online-advert-fraud-in-2017.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> from ad verification company <strong>Adloox. </strong></p>
<p>The plea agreements state that Jha, White and another person who also pleaded guilty to click fraud conspiracy charges &#8212; a 21-year-old from Metairie, Louisiana named <strong>Dalton Norman</strong> &#8212; leased access to their botnet for the purposes of earning fraudulent advertising revenue through click fraud activity and renting out their botnet to other cybercriminals.</p>
<p>As part of this scheme, victim devices were used to transmit high volumes of requests to view web addresses associated with affiliate advertising content. Because the victim activity resembled legitimate views of these websites, the activity generated fraudulent profits through the sites hosting the advertising content, at the expense of online advertising companies.</p>
<p>Jha and his co-conspirators admitted receiving as part of the click fraud scheme approximately two hundred bitcoin, valued on January 29, 2017 at over $180,000.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Norman personally earned over 30 bitcoin, valued on January 29, 2017 at approximately $27,000. The documents show that Norman helped Jha and White discover new, previously unknown vulnerabilities in IoT devices that could be used to beef up their Mirai botnet, which at its height grew to more than 300,000 hacked devices.</p>
<h4>MASSIVE ATTACKS</h4>
<p>The Mirai malware is responsible for coordinating some of the largest and most disruptive online attacks the Internet has ever witnessed. The biggest and first to gain widespread media attention <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began on Sept. 20, 2016</a>, when KrebsOnSecurity came under a sustained distributed denial-of-service attack from more than 175,000 IoT devices (the size estimates come from <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-antonakakis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Usenix paper</a> (PDF) on the Mirai botnet evolution).</p>
<p>That September 2016 digital siege maxed out at 620 Gbps, almost twice the size of the next-largest attack that <strong>Akamai</strong> &#8212; my DDoS mitigation provider at the time &#8212; had ever seen.</p>

												<p>The final Patch Tuesday of the year is upon us, with <strong>Adobe</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> each issuing security updates for their software once again. Redmond fixed problems with various flavors of <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>, <strong>Office</strong>, <strong>Exchange</strong> and its <strong>Malware Protection Engine</strong>. And of course Adobe&#8217;s got another security update available for its <strong>Flash Player </strong>software.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="" width="202" height="212" />The December patch batch addresses more than 30 vulnerabilities in Windows and related software. As per usual, a huge chunk of the updates from Microsoft tackle security problems with the Web browsers built into Windows.</p>
<p>Also in the batch today is an <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out-of-band update</a> that Microsoft first issued last week to fix a critical issue in its <strong>Malware Protection Engine</strong>, the component that drives the <strong>Windows Defender/Microsoft Security Essentials</strong> embedded in most modern versions of Windows, as well as <strong>Microsoft Endpoint Protection</strong>, and the <strong>Windows Intune Endpoint Protection</strong> anti-malware system.</p>
<p>Microsoft was reportedly made aware of the malware protection engine <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug</a> by the U.K.&#8217;s <strong>National Cyber Security Centre</strong> (NCSC), a division of the <strong>Government Communications Headquarters</strong> &#8212; the United Kingdom&#8217;s main intelligence and security agency. As spooky as that sounds, Microsoft said it is not aware of active attacks exploiting this flaw. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/patch-tuesday-december-2017-edition/#more-41839" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Not long ago, phishing attacks were fairly easy for the average Internet user to spot: Full of grammatical and spelling errors, and linking to phony bank or email logins at unencrypted (http:// vs. https://) Web pages. Increasingly, however, phishers are upping their game, polishing their copy and hosting scam pages over https:// connections &#8212; complete with the green lock icon in the browser address bar to make the fake sites appear more legitimate.</p>
<div id="attachment_41802" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PAYPALhttpsphish.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41802" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-41802" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PAYPALhttpsphish.png" alt="" width="599" height="320" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-41802" class="wp-caption-text">A brand new (and live) PayPal phishing page that uses SSL (https://) to appear more legitimate.</p></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/quarter-phishing-attacks-hosted-https-domains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stats released this week</a> by anti-phishing firm <strong>PhishLabs</strong>, nearly 25 percent of all phishing sites in the third quarter of this year were hosted on HTTPS domains &#8212; almost double the percentage seen in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;A year ago, less than three percent of phish were hosted on websites using SSL certificates,&#8221; wrote <strong>Crane Hassold</strong>, the company&#8217;s threat intelligence manager. &#8220;Two years ago, this figure was less than one percent.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_41803" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41803" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-41803" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/facebook2https.png" alt="" width="599" height="321" /><p id="caption-attachment-41803" class="wp-caption-text">A currently live Facebook phishing page that uses https.</p></div>
<p>As shown in the examples above (which KrebsOnSecurity found in just a few minutes of searching via phish site reporting service <a href="https://www.phishtank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phishtank.com</a>), the most successful phishing sites tend to include not only their own SSL certificates but also a portion of the phished domain in the fake address.</p>
<p>Why are phishers more aggressively adopting HTTPS Web sites? Traditionally, many phishing pages are hosted on hacked, legitimate Web sites, in which case the attackers can leverage both the site&#8217;s good reputation and its SSL certificate.</p>
<p>Yet this, too, is changing, says PhishLabs&#8217; Hassold.</p>
<p>&#8220;An analysis of Q3 HTTPS phishing attacks against PayPal and Apple, the two primary targets of these attacks, indicates that nearly three-quarters of HTTPS phishing sites targeting them were hosted on maliciously-registered domains rather than compromised websites, which is substantially higher than the overall global rate,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;<a href="https://docs.apwg.org/reports/APWG_Global_Phishing_Report_2015-2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-ss1512504894="1">Based on data from 2016</a>, slightly less than half of all phishing sites were hosted on domains registered by a threat actor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hassold posits that more phishers are moving to HTTPS because it helps increase the likelihood that users will trust that the site is legitimate. After all, your average Internet user has been taught for years to simply &#8220;look for the lock icon&#8221; in the browser address bar as assurance that a site is safe.</p>
<p>Perhaps this once was useful advice, but if so its reliability has waned over the years. In November, PhishLabs conducted a poll to see how many people actually knew the meaning of the green padlock that is associated with HTTPS websites.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 80% of the respondents believed the green lock indicated that a website was either legitimate and/or safe, neither of which is true,&#8221; he wrote. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/phishers-are-upping-their-game-so-should-you/#more-41787" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Crooks who make and deploy ATM skimmers are constantly engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with financial institutions, which deploy a variety of technological measures designed to defeat skimming devices. The latest innovation aimed at tipping the scales in favor of skimmer thieves is a small, battery powered device that provides crooks a digital readout indicating whether an ATM likely includes digital anti-skimming technology.</p>
<p>A well-known skimmer thief is marketing a product called &#8220;Smart Shield Detector&#8221; that claims to be able to detect a variety of electronic methods used by banks to foil ATM skimmers.</p>
<div align="center"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/caklX1dDB2U" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>The device, which sells for $200, is called a &#8220;Smart Shield Detector,&#8221; and promises to detect &#8220;all kinds of noise shields, hidden shields, delayed shields and others!&#8221;</p>
<p>It appears to be a relatively simple machine that gives a digital numeric indicator of whether an ATM uses any of a variety of anti-skimming methods. One of the most common is known as &#8220;frequency jamming,&#8221; which uses electronic signals to scramble both the clock (timing) and the card data itself in a bid to confuse skimming devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will see current level within seconds!,&#8221; the seller enthuses in an online ad for the product, a snippet of which is shown above. &#8220;Available for sale after November 1st, market price 200usd. Preorders available at price 150usd/device. 2+ devices for your team &#8211; will give discounts.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the individual selling the Smart Shield Detector, a readout of 15 or higher indicates the presence of some type of electronic shield or jamming technology &#8212; warning the skimmer thief to consider leaving that ATM alone and to find a less protected machine. In contrast, a score between 3-5 is meant to indicate &#8220;no shield,&#8221; i.e., that the ATM is ripe for compromise. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/anti-skimmer-detector-for-skimmer-scammers/#more-41737" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Leakbase</strong>, a Web site that indexed and sold access to billions of usernames and passwords stolen in some of the world largest data breaches, has closed up shop. A source close to the matter says the service was taken down in a law enforcement sting that may be tied to the Dutch police raid of the <strong>Hansa</strong> dark web market earlier this year.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lbintro.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-41768" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lbintro.png" alt="" width="598" height="230" /></a></p>
<p>Leakbase[dot]pw began selling memberships in September 2016, advertising more than two billion usernames and passwords that were stolen in high-profile breaches at sites like <strong>linkedin.com</strong>, <strong>myspace.com</strong> and <strong>dropbox.com</strong>.</p>
<p>But roughly two weeks ago KrebsOnSecurity began hearing from Leakbase users who were having trouble reaching the normally responsive and helpful support staff responsible for assisting customers with purchases and site issues.</p>
<p>Sometime this weekend, Leakbase began redirecting visitors to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haveibeenpwned.com</a>, a legitimate breach alerting service run by security researcher <strong>Troy Hunt</strong> (Hunt&#8217;s site lets visitors check if their email address has shown up in any public database leaks, but it does not store corresponding account passwords).</p>
<p><span data-reactid=".5.2.$lazyPlaceholder_twitter_937541381916065796.2.2.0.0.0.4">Leakbase reportedly came under new ownership after its hack in April. According to a source with knowledge of the matter but who asked to remain anonymous, the new owners of Leakbase dabbled in dealing illicit drugs at <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=hansa+alphabay&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansa</a>, a dark web marketplace that was dismantled in July by authorities in The Netherlands. </span> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/hacked-password-service-leakbase-goes-dark/#more-41756" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A former employee for the <strong>National Security Agency</strong> pleaded guilty on Friday to taking classified data to his home computer in Maryland. According to published reports, U.S. intelligence officials believe the data was then stolen from his computer by hackers working for the Russian government.</p>
<p><strong>Nghia Hoang Pho</strong>, 67, of Ellicott City, Maryland, pleaded guilty today to &#8220;willful retention of national defense information.&#8221; The <strong>U.S. Justice Department </strong>says that beginning in April 2006 Pho was employed as a developer for the NSA&#8217;s <strong>Tailored Access Operations</strong> (TAO) unit, which develops specialized hacking tools to gather intelligence data from foreign targets and information systems.</p>
<p>According to Pho&#8217;s plea agreement, between 2010 and March 2015 he removed and retained highly sensitive classified &#8220;documents and writings that contained national defense information, including information classified as Top Secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pho is the third NSA worker to be charged in the past two years with mishandling classified data. His plea is the latest &#8212; and perhaps final &#8212; chapter in the NSA&#8217;s hunt for those responsible for leaking NSA hacking tools that have been published online over the past year by a shadowy group calling itself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shadow Brokers</a>.</p>
<p>Neither the government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/maryland-man-pleads-guilty-willful-retention-national-defense-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> about the plea nor <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1015281/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the complaint</a> against Pho mention what happened to the classified documents after he took them home.

												<p><strong>Roman Seleznev</strong>, a Russian man who is already serving a record 27-year sentence in the United States for cybercrime charges, was handed a 14-year sentence this week by a federal judge in Atlanta for his role in a credit card and identity theft conspiracy that prosecutors say netted more than $50 million. Separately, a Canadian national has pleaded guilty to charges of helping to steal more than a billion user account credentials from <strong>Yahoo</strong>.</p>
<p>Seleznev, 33, was given the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-cyber-criminal-sentenced-14-years-prison-role-organized-cybercrime-ring-responsible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-year sentence</a> in connection with two prosecutions that were consolidated in Georgia: The <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/11/eight_indicted_in_9m_rbs_world.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2008 heist</a> against Atlanta-based credit card processor <strong>RBS Worldpay</strong>; and a case out of Nevada where he was charged as a leading merchant of stolen credit cards at <strong>carder[dot]su</strong>, at one time perhaps the most bustling fraud forum where members openly marketed a variety of cybercrime-oriented services.</p>
<div id="attachment_41728" style="width: 595px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41728" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-41728" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/seleznevcash.png" alt="" width="585" height="353" /><p id="caption-attachment-41728" class="wp-caption-text">Roman Seleznev, pictured with bundles of cash. Image: US DOJ.</p></div>
<p>Seleznev&#8217;s conviction comes more than a year after he was convicted in a Seattle court on 38 counts of cybercrime charges, including wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. The Seattle conviction earned Seleznev a 27-year prison sentence &#8212; the most jail time ever given to an individual convicted of cybercrime charges in the United States.</p>
<p>This latest sentence will be served concurrently &#8212; meaning it will not add any time to his 27-year sentence. But it&#8217;s worth noting because Seleznev is appealing the Seattle verdict. In the event he prevails in Seattle and gets that conviction overturned, he will still serve out his 14-year sentence in the Georgia case because he pleaded guilty to those charges and waived his right to an appeal.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Seleznev, known in the underworld by his hacker nicknames &#8220;nCux&#8221; and &#8220;Bulba,&#8221; enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle prior to his arrest, driving expensive sports cars and dropping tens of thousands of dollars at lavish island vacation spots. The son of an influential Russian politician, Seleznev made international headlines in 2014 after he was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/08/us-usa-cybersecurity-arrest-idUSKBN0FD0Z020140708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captured</a> while vacationing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Maldives</a>, a popular destination for Russians and one that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/06/chronopay-co-founder-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Russian cybercriminals</a> previously <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/GusevViagra.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered</a> to be out of reach for western law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>However, U.S. authorities were able to negotiate a secret deal with the Maldivian government to apprehend Seleznev. Following his capture, Seleznev was whisked away to Guam for <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3673513/Seleznev-US-Atty-Sentencing-Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a month</a> before being transported to Washington state to stand trial for computer hacking charges.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department says the laptop found with him when he was arrested contained more than 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, and that evidence presented at trial showed that Seleznev earned tens of millions of dollars defrauding more than 3,400 financial institutions.</p>
<p>Investigators also reportedly <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/seattle-jury-convicts-russian-man-of-massive-business-hacking-id-theft-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a smoking gun: a password cheat sheet</a> that linked Seleznev to a decade’s worth of criminal hacking.

<p>In an unrelated case, federal prosecutors in California <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/canadian-hacker-who-conspired-and-aided-russian-fsb-officers-pleads-guilty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a guilty plea</a> from <strong>Karim Baratov</strong>, one of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVqsD9menXAhUFm-AKHaqrD-8QFggwMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fkrebsonsecurity.com%2F2017%2F03%2Ffour-men-charged-with-hacking-500m-yahoo-accounts%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hNqWKX8MzjCGi0xNTx4T6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four men indicted in March 2017</a> for hacking into Yahoo beginning in 2014.

												<p>A newly-discovered flaw in <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/high-sierra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macOS High Sierra</a> &#8212; Apple&#8217;s latest iteration of its operating system &#8212; allows anyone with local (and, apparently in some cases, remote) access to the machine to log in as the all-powerful &#8220;root&#8221; user without supplying a password. Fortunately, there is a simple fix for this until Apple patches this inexplicable bug: Change the root account&#8217;s password <em>now</em>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-41705" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/macoshighsierra.png" alt="" width="600" height="341" /></p>
<p><strong>Update, Nov. 29, 11:40 a.m. ET:</strong> Apple has released a patch for this flaw. More information on the fix is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The update is available via the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store app</a> on your Mac. Click Updates in the App Store toolbar, then use the Update buttons to download and install any updates listed.</p>
<p><em>Original story:</em></p>
<p>For better or worse, this glaring vulnerability was first disclosed today on Twitter by Turkish software developer <strong>Lemi Orhan Ergin</strong>, who unleashed his findings onto the Internet with <a href="https://twitter.com/lemiorhan/status/935578694541770752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tweet</a> to @AppleSupport:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Dear @AppleSupport, we noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra. Anyone can login as &#8220;root&#8221; with empty password after clicking on login button several times. Are you aware of it @Apple?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>High Sierra users should be able to replicate the exploit by accessing System Preferences, then Users &amp; Groups, and then click the lock to make changes. Type &#8220;root&#8221; with no password, and simply try that several times until the system relents and lets you in.</p>
<p>How does one change the root password? It&#8217;s simple enough. Open up a Terminal (in the Spotlight search box just type &#8220;terminal&#8221;) and type &#8220;sudo passwd root&#8221;. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/macos-high-sierra-users-change-root-password-now/#more-41703" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>KrebsOnSecurity has sought to call attention to online services which expose sensitive consumer data if the user knows a handful of static details about a person that are broadly for sale in the cybercrime underground, such as name, date of birth, and Social Security Number. Perhaps the most eye-opening example of this is on display at <strong>fafsa.ed.gov</strong>, the Web site set up by the <strong>U.S. Department of Education</strong> for anyone interested in applying for federal student financial aid.</p>
<p><strong>Update, Nov. 28, 12:34 p.m. ET:</strong> The Education Department says not all of the data elements mentioned below are accessible on a FAFSA applicant if someone merely knows the static details about that person. Read on for their response to this story.</p>
<p><em>Original story:</em></p>
<p>Short for the <strong>Free Application for Federal Student Aid</strong>, FAFSA is an extremely lengthy and detailed form required at all colleges that accept and award federal aid to students.</p>
<p>Visitors to the login page for FAFSA have two options: Enter either the student&#8217;s FSA ID and password, or choose &#8220;enter the student&#8217;s information.&#8221; Selecting the latter brings up a prompt to enter the student&#8217;s first and last name, followed by their date of birth and Social Security Number.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-41638" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fafsa-ssn-dob.png" alt="" width="604" height="454" /></p>
<p>Anyone who successfully supplies that information on a student who has applied for financial aid through FAFSA then gets to see a virtual colonoscopy of personal information on that individual and their family&#8217;s finances &#8212; including almost 200 different data elements.</p>
<p>The information returned includes all of these data fields:</p>
<p>1. Student&#8217;s Last Name:<br />
2. Student&#8217;s First Name:<br />
3. Student&#8217;s Middle Initial:<br />

<p>According to the Education Department, nearly 20 million students filled out this form in <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/application-volume/fafsa-school-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2015/2016 application cycle</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The process described above was based on a demonstration this author saw while sharing a screen with a KrebsOnSecurity reader who had a family member apply for aid through FAFSA. But an Education Department spokesperson took strong exception to my experience, saying that while someone armed with an applicant&#8217;s SSN and date of birth would be able to view some of the less sensitive data elements related to an application that has already been submitted and processed, seeing the more sensitive data requires and additional authentication step.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said the data is displayed across several pages that require manual advancement, and that before the pages with financial data are shown the visitor is prompted to supply a username and password that all users are required to create when they start the application process. The agency said that without those credentials, the system should not display the rest of the data.</p>
<p>In cases where a student has saved but not completed an application, the spokesperson said, the applicant is prompted to create a &#8220;save key,&#8221; or temporary password that needs to be supplied before the financial data is displayed.<br />

												<p>KrebsOnSecurity recently <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/hack-of-attack-for-hire-service-vdos-snares-new-mexico-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured a story</a> about a New Mexico man who stands accused of using the now-defunct <strong>vDOS</strong> attack-for-hire service to hobble the Web sites of several former employers. That piece stated that I wasn&#8217;t aware of any other prosecutions related to vDOS customers, but as it happens there <em>was</em> a prosecution in the United Kingdom earlier this year of a man who&#8217;s admitted to both using and helping to administer vDOS. Here&#8217;s a look at some open-source clues that may have led to the U.K. man&#8217;s arrest.</p>
<div id="attachment_41606" style="width: 256px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41606" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-41606" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jchappell.png" alt="" width="246" height="165" /><p id="caption-attachment-41606" class="wp-caption-text">Jack Chappell, outside of a court hearing in the U.K. earlier this year.</p></div>
<p>In early July 2017, the West Midlands Police in the U.K. <a href="https://www.west-midlands.police.uk/news/3065/student-court-over-global-web-attack-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested</a> 19-year-old Stockport resident <strong>Jack Chappell</strong> and charged him with aiding the vDOS co-founders &#8212; two Israeli men who were <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/alleged-vdos-proprietors-arrested-in-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested late year</a> and charged with running the service.</p>
<p>Until its demise in September 2016, vDOS was by far the most popular and powerful attack-for-hire service, allowing even completely unskilled Internet users to launch crippling assaults capable of knocking most Web sites offline. vDOS made more than $600,000 in just two of the four years it was in operation, launching more than 150,000 attacks against thousands of victims (including this site).</p>
<p>For his part, Chappell was charged with assisting in attacks against Web sites for some of the world&#8217;s largest companies, including <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>BBC</strong>, <strong>BT</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong>, <strong>Virgin Media</strong>, and <strong>Vodafone</strong>, between May 1, 2015 and April 30, 2016.</p>
<p>At the end of July 2017, Chappell pleaded guilty to those allegations, as well as charges of helping vDOS launder money from customers wishing to pay for attacks with PayPal accounts.</p>
<p>A big factor in that plea was the leak of the vDOS attacks, customer support and payments databases to this author and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/israeli-online-attack-service-vdos-earned-600000-in-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to U.S. law enforcement officials in the fall of 2016</a>. Those databases provided extremely detailed information about co-conspirators, paying customers and victims.</p>
<p>But as with many other cybercrime investigations, the perpetrator in this case appears to have been caught thanks to a combination of several all-too-common factors, including password re-use, an active presence on the sprawling English-language hacking community <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=hackforums&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hackforums</a>, and domain names registered in his real name. In combination, these clues provide a crucial bridge between Chappell&#8217;s online and real-world identities. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/correcting-the-record-on-vdos-prosecutions/#more-41584" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
