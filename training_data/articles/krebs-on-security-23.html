												<p>The Coronavirus has prompted thousands of information security professionals to volunteer their skills in upstart collaborative efforts aimed at frustrating cybercriminals who are seeking to exploit the crisis for financial gain. Whether it&#8217;s helping hospitals avoid becoming the next ransomware victim or kneecapping new COVID-19-themed scam websites, these nascent partnerships may well end up saving lives. But can this unprecedented level of collaboration survive the pandemic?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-51280" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covidlock.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" />At least three major industry groups are working to counter the latest cyber threats and scams. Among the largest in terms of contributors is the <a href="https://www.cyberthreatcoalition.org/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition</a> (CTC), which comprises rough 3,000 security professionals who are collecting, vetting and sharing new intelligence about new cyber threats.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Espinosa</strong>, a self-described &#8220;security fanatic,&#8221; author and public speaker who&#8217;s handling communications for the CTC, said the group does most of its work remotely via a dedicated Slack channel, where many infosec professionals seem eager to counter the gusto with which the cybercriminal community has sought to profit by exacerbating an already difficult situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nurse or doctor can&#8217;t do what we do, and we can&#8217;t do what they do,&#8221; Espinosa said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a massive rise in threats and attacks against healthcare systems, but it&#8217;s worse if someone dies due to a malicious cyberattack when we have the ability to prevent that. A lot of people are involved because they&#8217;re emotionally attached to the idea of helping this critical infrastructure stay safe and online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using threat intelligence feeds donated by dozens of cybersecurity companies, the CTC is poring over more than 100 million pieces of data about potential threats each day, running those indicators through security products from roughly 70 different vendors. If at least 10 of those flag a specific data point &#8212; such as a domain name &#8212; as malicious or bad, it gets added to <a href="https://blacklist.cyberthreatcoalition.org/vetted/domain.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the CTC&#8217;s blocklist</a>, which is designed to be used by organizations worldwide for blocking malicious traffic.</p>
<p>&#8220;For possible threats, meaning between five and nine vendors detect an indicator as bad, our volunteers manually verify that the indicator is malicious before including it in our blocklist,&#8221; Espinosa said.</p>
<p>Another Slack-based upstart coalition called the COVID-19 CTI League spans more than 40 countries and includes professionals in senior positions at such major companies as Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rogers</strong>, one of several people helping to manage the CTI League&#8217;s efforts, <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/coronavirus-cyber/cybersecurity-experts-come-together-to-fight-coronavirus-related-hacking-idINKBN21D09F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Reuters</a> the top priority of the group is working to combat hacks against medical facilities and other frontline responders to the pandemic, as well as helping defend communication networks and services that have become essential as more people work from home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The group is also using its web of contacts in internet infrastructure providers to squash garden-variety phishing attacks and another financial crime that is using the fear of COVID-19 or the desire for information on it to trick regular internet users,&#8221; wrote Reuters&#8217; <strong>Joe Menn</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve never seen this volume of phishing,” Rogers told Reuters. “I am literally seeing phishing messages in every language known to man.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/covid-19-has-united-cybersecurity-experts-but-will-that-unity-survive-the-pandemic/#more-51249" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released updates to fix 113 security vulnerabilities in its various <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and related software. Those include at least three flaws that are actively being exploited, as well as two others which were publicly detailed prior to today, potentially giving attackers a head start in figuring out how to exploit the bugs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="" width="229" height="240" />Nineteen of the weaknesses fixed on this Patch Tuesday were assigned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire “critical” rating, meaning malware or miscreants could exploit them to gain complete, remote control over vulnerable computers without any help from users.</p>
<p>Near the top of the heap is <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2020-1020</a>, a remotely exploitable bug in the <strong>Adobe Font Manager</strong> library that was first detailed in late March when Microsoft said it had seen the flaw being used in active attacks.</p>
<p>The Adobe Font Manager library is the source of yet another zero-day flaw &#8212; <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2020-0938</a> &#8212; although experts at security vendor <strong>Tenable</strong> say there is currently no confirmation that the two are related to the same set of in-the-wild attacks. Both flaws could be exploited by getting a Windows users to open a booby-trapped document or viewing one in the Windows Preview Pane.</p>
<p>The other zero-day flaw (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2020-1027</a>) affects <strong>Windows 7</strong> and <strong>Windows 10 systems</strong>, and earned a slightly less dire &#8220;important&#8221; rating from Microsoft because it&#8217;s an &#8220;elevation of privilege&#8221; bug that requires the attacker to be locally authenticated.</p>
<p>Many security news sites are reporting that Microsoft addressed a total of four zero-day flaws this month, but it appears the advisory for a critical Internet Explorer flaw (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2020-0968</a>) has been revised to indicate Microsoft has not yet received reports of it being used in active attacks. However, the advisory says this IE bug is likely to be exploited soon.</p>
<p>Researchers at security firm <strong>Recorded Future</strong> zeroed in on <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2020-0796</a>, a critical vulnerability dubbed &#8220;SMBGhost&#8221; that was rumored to exist in last month&#8217;s Patch Tuesday but for which an out-of-band patch wasn&#8217;t released until March 12. The problem resides in a file-sharing component of Windows, and could be exploited merely by sending the victim machine specially-crafted data packets. Proof-of-concept code showing how to exploit the bug was released April 1, but so far there are no indications this method has been incorporated into malware or active attacks.</p>
<p>Recorded Future&#8217;s <strong>Allan Liska</strong> notes that one reason these past few months have seen so many patches from Microsoft is the company <a href="https://twitter.com/SandboxBear/status/1210133985478791171" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently hired &#8220;SandboxEscaper,&#8221;</a> a nickname used by the security researcher responsible for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/05/serial-publisher-of-windows-0days-drops-exploits-for-3-more-unfixed-flaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing more than a half-dozen zero-day flaws</a> against Microsoft products last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;SandboxEscaper has made several contributions to this month’s Patch Tuesday,&#8221; Liska said. &#8220;This is great news for Microsoft and the security community at large.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/microsoft-patch-tuesday-april-2020-edition/#more-51191" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The U.S. federal government is now in the process of sending <strong>Economic Impact Payments</strong> by direct deposit to millions of Americans. Most who are eligible for payments can expect to have funds direct-deposited into the same bank accounts listed on previous years&#8217; tax filings sometime next week. Today, the <strong>Internal Revenue Service</strong> (IRS) stood up a site to collect bank account information from the many Americans who don&#8217;t usually file a tax return. The question is, will those non-filers have a chance to claim their payments before fraudsters do?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-42398" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/taxthiefa.png" alt="" width="594" height="218" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The IRS says</a> the Economic Impact Payment will be $1,200 for individual or head of household filers, and $2,400 for married filing jointly if they are not a dependent of another taxpayer and have a work eligible Social Security number with adjusted gross income up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$75,000 for individuals</li>
<li>$112,500 for head of household filers and</li>
<li>$150,000 for married couples filing joint returns</li>
</ul>
<p>Taxpayers with higher incomes will receive more modest payments (reduced by $5 for each $100 above the $75,000/$112,500/$150,000 thresholds). Most people who who filed a tax return in 2018 and/or 2019 and provided their bank account information for a debit or credit should soon see an Economic Impact Payment direct-deposited into their bank accounts. Likewise, people drawing Social Security payments from the government will receive stimulus payments the same way.</p>
<p>But there are millions of U.S. residents &#8212; including low-income workers and certain veterans and individuals with disabilities &#8212; who aren&#8217;t required to file a tax return but who are still eligible to receive at least a $1,200 stimulus payment. And earlier today, <a href="https://www.freefilefillableforms.com/#/fd/EconomicImpactPayment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the IRS unveiled a Web site</a> where it is asking those non-filers to provide their bank account information for direct deposits.</p>
<p>However, the possibility that fraudsters may intercept payments to these individuals seems very real, given the relatively lax identification requirements of this non-filer portal and the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/page/3/?s=tax+irs&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high incidence of tax refund fraud in years past</a>. Each year, scam artists file phony tax refund requests on millions of Americans, regardless of whether or not the impersonated taxpayer is actually due a refund. In most cases, the victim only finds out when he or she goes to file their taxes and has the return rejected because it has already been filed by scammers.</p>
<p>In this case, fraudsters would simply need to identify the personal information for a pool of Americans who don&#8217;t normally file tax returns, which may well include a large number of people who are disabled, poor or simply do not have easy access to a computer or the Internet. Armed with this information, the scammers need only provide the target&#8217;s name, address, date of birth and Social Security number, and then supply their own bank account information to claim at least $1,200 in electronic payments.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/03/who-built-the-id-theft-service-ssndob-ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSN and DOB data is not secret</a>, nor is it hard to come by. As noted in countless stories here, there are multiple shops in the cybercrime underground that sell SSN and DOB data on tens of millions of Americans for a few dollars per record.</p>
<p>A review of the Web site set up to accept bank account information for the stimulus payments reveals few other mandatory identity checks to complete the filing process. It appears that all applicants need to provide a mobile phone number and verify they can receive text messages at that number, but beyond that the rest of the identity checks seem to be optional. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/new-irs-site-could-make-it-easy-for-thieves-to-intercept-some-stimulus-payments/#more-51193" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In February, KrebsOnSecurity told the story of a private citizen <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/dangerous-domain-corp-com-goes-up-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auctioning off the dangerous domain <strong>corp.com</strong> for the starting price of $1.7 million</a>. Domain experts called corp.com dangerous because years of testing showed whoever wields it would have access to an unending stream of passwords, email and other sensitive data from hundreds of thousands of <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> PCs at major companies around the globe. This week, <strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong> agreed to buy the domain in a bid to keep it out of the hands of those who might abuse its awesome power.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-50460" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/corpcomtoxic.png" alt="" width="595" height="159" /></p>
<p>Wisconsin native <strong>Mike O&#8217;Connor</strong>, who bought corp.com 26 years ago but has done very little with it since, said he hoped Microsoft would buy it because hundreds of thousands of confused Windows PCs are constantly trying to share sensitive data with corp.com. Also, early versions of Windows actually encouraged the adoption of insecure settings that made it more likely Windows computers might try to share sensitive data with corp.com.</p>
<p>From February&#8217;s piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>At issue is a problem known as “<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3480799/icann-seeks-to-tackle-dns-namespace-collision-risks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">namespace collision</a>,” a situation where domain names intended to be used exclusively on an internal company network end up overlapping with domains that can resolve normally on the open Internet.</p>
<p>Windows computers on an internal corporate network validate other things on that network using a Microsoft innovation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Active Directory</a>, which is the umbrella term for a broad range of identity-related services in Windows environments. A core part of the way these things find each other involves a Windows feature called “<a href="https://www.itprotoday.com/security/whats-dns-name-devolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNS name devolution</a>,” which is a kind of network shorthand that makes it easier to find other computers or servers without having to specify a full, legitimate domain name for those resources.</p>
<p>For instance, if a company runs an internal network with the name internalnetwork.example.com, and an employee on that network wishes to access a shared drive called “drive1,” there’s no need to type “drive1.internalnetwork.example.com” into Windows Explorer; typing “\\drive1\” alone will suffice, and Windows takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>But things can get far trickier with an internal Windows domain that does not map back to a second-level domain the organization actually owns and controls. And unfortunately, in early versions of Windows that supported Active Directory — Windows 2000 Server, for example — the default or example Active Directory path was given as “corp,” and many companies apparently adopted this setting without modifying it to include a domain they controlled.</p>
<p>Compounding things further, some companies then went on to build (and/or assimilate) vast networks of networks on top of this erroneous setting.</p>
<p>Now, none of this was much of a security concern back in the day when it was impractical for employees to lug their bulky desktop computers and monitors outside of the corporate network. But what happens when an employee working at a company with an Active Directory network path called “corp” takes a company laptop to the local Starbucks?</p>
<p>Chances are good that at least some resources on the employee’s laptop will still try to access that internal “corp” domain. And because of the way DNS name devolution works on Windows, that company laptop online via the Starbucks wireless connection is likely to then seek those same resources at “corp.com.”</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means that whoever controls corp.com can passively intercept private communications from hundreds of thousands of computers that end up being taken outside of a corporate environment which uses this “corp” designation for its Active Directory domain.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story went on to describe how years of testing &#8212; some of which was subsidized by grants from the <strong>U.S. Department of Homeland Security</strong> &#8212; showed hundreds of thousands of Windows computers were constantly trying to send this domain information it had no business receiving, including attempts to log in to internal corporate networks and access specific file shares on those networks.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor told me he was selling the domain after doing basically nothing with it for 26 years because he was getting on in years and didn&#8217;t want his kids to inherit this mess. When he put the domain up for sale, I asked if he&#8217;d agree to let me know if and when he sold it.</p>
<p>On Monday evening, he wrote to say that Microsoft had agreed to purchase it. O&#8217;Connor said he could  not discuss the terms of the deal, nor could he offer further comment beyond acknowledging the sale of corp.com to Microsoft. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/microsoft-buys-corp-com-so-bad-guys-cant/#more-51195" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>As the Coronavirus pandemic continues to force people to work from home, countless companies are now holding daily meetings using videoconferencing services from <strong>Zoom</strong>. But without the protection of a password, there&#8217;s a decent chance your next Zoom meeting could be &#8220;Zoom bombed&#8221; &#8212; attended or disrupted by someone who doesn&#8217;t belong. And according to data gathered by a new automated Zoom meeting discovery tool dubbed &#8220;<strong>zWarDial</strong>,&#8221; a crazy number of meetings at major corporations are not being protected by a password.</p>
<div id="attachment_51183" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zwardial-red1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51183" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-51183" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zwardial-red1.png" alt="" width="598" height="569" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-51183" class="wp-caption-text">zWarDial, an automated tool for finding non-password protected Zoom meetings. According to its makers, zWarDial can find on average 110 meetings per hour, and has a success rate of around 14 percent.</p></div>
<p>Each Zoom conference call is assigned a Meeting ID that consists of 9 to 11 digits. Naturally, hackers have figured out they can simply guess or automate the guessing of random IDs within that space of digits.</p>
<p>Security experts at <strong>Check Point Research</strong> <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/zoom-zoom-we-are-watching-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did exactly that last summer</a>, and found they were able to predict approximately four percent of randomly generated Meeting IDs. The Check Point researchers said enabling passwords on each meeting was the only thing that prevented them from randomly finding a meeting.</p>
<p>Zoom responded by saying it was enabling passwords by default in all future scheduled meetings. Zoom also said it would block repeated attempts to scan for meeting IDs, and that it would no longer automatically indicate if a meeting ID was valid or invalid.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the incidence of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/zoombombing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoombombing</a> has skyrocketed over the past few weeks, even prompting an alert by the FBI on how to secure meetings against eavesdroppers and mischief-makers. This suggests that many Zoom users have disabled passwords by default and/or that Zoom&#8217;s new security feature simply isn&#8217;t working as intended for all users.</p>
<p>New data and acknowledgments by Zoom itself suggest the latter may be more likely.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from <a href="https://www.twitter.com/surbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trent Lo</a>, a security professional and co-founder of <a href="https://www.seckc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecKC</a>, Kansas City&#8217;s longest-running monthly security meetup. Lo and fellow SecKC members recently created <strong>zWarDial</strong>, which borrows part of its name from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb1r_uKOew4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the old phone-based war dialing programs</a> that called random or sequential numbers in a given telephone number prefix to search for computer modems.</p>
<p>Lo said zWarDial evades Zoom&#8217;s attempts to block automated meeting scans by routing the searches through multiple proxies in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tor</a>, a free and open-source software that lets users browse the Web anonymously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zoom recently said they fixed this but I&#8217;m using a totally different URL and passing a cookie along with that URL,&#8221; Lo said, describing part of how the tool works on the back end. &#8220;This gives me the [Zoom meeting] room information without having to log in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lo said a single instance of zWarDial can find approximately 100 meetings per hour, but that multiple instances of the tool running in parallel could probably discover most of the open Zoom meetings on any given day. Each instance, he said, has a success rate of approximately 14 percent, meaning for each random meeting number it tries, the program has a 14 percent chance of finding an open meeting.</p>
<p>Only meetings that are protected by a password are undetectable by zWarDial, Lo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a password enabled on the meeting is the only thing that defeats it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lo shared the output of one day&#8217;s worth of zWarDial scanning, which revealed information about nearly 2,400 upcoming or recurring Zoom meetings. That information included the link needed to join each meeting; the date and time of the meeting; the name of the meeting organizer; and any information supplied by the meeting organizer about the topic of the meeting.</p>
<p>The results were staggering, and revealed details about Zoom meetings scheduled by some of the world&#8217;s largest companies, including major banks, international consulting firms, ride-hailing services, government contractors, and investment ratings firms.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity is not naming the companies involved, but was able to verify dozens of them by matching the name of the meeting organizer with corporate profiles on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>By far the largest group of companies exposing their Zoom meetings are in the technology sector, and include a number of security and cloud technology vendors. These include at least one tech company that&#8217;s taken to social media warning people about the need to password protect Zoom meetings!</p>

												<p>A spear-phishing attack this week hooked a customer service employee at <strong>GoDaddy.com</strong>, the world&#8217;s largest domain name registrar, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. The incident gave the phisher the ability to view and modify key customer records, access that was used to change domain settings for a half-dozen GoDaddy customers, including transaction brokering site <strong>escrow.com</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.escrow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escrow.com</a> helps people safely broker all sorts of transactions online (ironically enough, brokering domain sales is a big part of its business). For about two hours starting around 5 p.m. PT Monday evening, Escrow.com&#8217;s website looked radically different: Its homepage was replaced with a crude message in plain text:</p>
<div id="attachment_51127" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/escrowmsg-red.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51127" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-51127" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/escrowmsg-red.png" alt="" width="599" height="62" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-51127" class="wp-caption-text">The profanity-laced message left behind by whoever briefly hijacked the DNS records for escrow.com. Image: Escrow.com</p></div>
<p>DomainInvesting.com&#8217;s <strong>Elliot Silver</strong> <a href="https://domaininvesting.com/escrow-com-statement-on-security-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up on the change</a> and got a statement from <strong>Matt Barrie</strong>, the CEO of <strong>freelancer.com</strong>, which owns escrow.com.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the incident, the hackers changed the DNS records for Escrow.com to point to to a third party web server,&#8221; <a href="https://www.escrow.com/updates/incident20200331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barrie wrote</a>, noting that his security team managed to talk to the hacker responsible for the hijack via telephone.</p>
<p>Barrie said escrow.com would be sharing more details about the incident in the coming days, but he emphasized that no escrow.com systems were compromised, and no customer data, funds or domains were compromised.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity reached out to Barrie and escrow.com with some follow-up questions, and immediately after that pinged <strong>Chris Ueland</strong>, CEO of <a href="https://securitytrails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecurityTrails</a>, a company that helps customers keep track of their digital assets.</p>
<p>Ueland said after hearing about the escrow.com hack Monday evening he pulled the domain name system (DNS) records for escrow.com and saw they were pointing to an Internet address in Malaysia &#8212; <strong>111.90.149[.]49 </strong>(that address is hobbled here because it is currently flagged as hosting a phishing site). The attacker also <a href="https://crt.sh/?q=escrow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained free encryption certificates for escrow.com</a> from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>.</p>
<p>Running a reverse DNS lookup on this 111.90.149[.]49 address shows it is tied to fewer than a dozen domains, including a 12-day-old domain that invokes the name of escrow.com&#8217;s registrar &#8212; <strong>servicenow-godaddy[.]com</strong>. Sure enough, loading that domain in a browser reveals the same text that appeared Monday night on escrow.com, minus the redaction above.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_51132" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/servicenowgodaddy.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51132" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-51132" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/servicenowgodaddy.png" alt="" width="594" height="42" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-51132" class="wp-caption-text">The message at servicenow-godaddy[.]com was identical to the one displayed by escrow.com while the site&#8217;s DNS records were hacked.</p></div>It was starting to look like someone had gotten phished. Then I heard back from Matt Barrie, who said it wasn&#8217;t anyone at escrow.com that got phished. Barrie said the hacker was able to read messages and notes left on escrow.com&#8217;s account at GoDaddy that only GoDaddy employees should have been able to see.</p>
<p>Barrie said one of those notes stated that certain key changes for escrow.com could only be made after calling a specific phone number and receiving verbal authorization. As it happened, the attacker went ahead and called that number, evidently assuming he was calling someone at GoDaddy.</p>
<p>In fact, the name and number belonged to escrow.com&#8217;s general manager, who played along for more than an hour talking to the attacker while recording the call and coaxing information out of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;This guy had access to the notes, and knew the number to call,&#8221; to make changes to the account, Barrie said. &#8220;He was literally reading off the tickets to the notes of the admin panel inside GoDaddy.&#8221;</p>

												<p>In 2018, KrebsOnSecurity unmasked the creators of <strong>Coinhive</strong> &#8212; a now-defunct cryptocurrency mining service that was being massively abused by cybercriminals &#8212; as the administrators of a popular German language image-hosting forum. In protest of that story, forum members donated hundreds of thousands of euros to nonprofits that combat cancer (Krebs means &#8220;cancer&#8221; in German). This week, the forum is celebrating its third annual observance of that protest to &#8220;fight Krebs,&#8221; albeit with a Coronavirus twist.</p>
<div id="attachment_51103" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/krebsaktion3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51103" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-51103" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/krebsaktion3.png" alt="" width="597" height="443" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-51103" class="wp-caption-text">Images posted to the decidedly not-safe-for-work German-language image forum pr0gramm[.]com. Members have posted a large number of &#8216;thank you&#8217; receipts from cancer research organizations that benefited from their fight cancer/krebs campaign.</p></div>
<p>On March 26, 2018, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/who-and-what-is-coinhive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Who and What is Coinhive</a>, which showed the founder of Coinhive was the co-creator of the German forum <strong>pr0gramm[dot]com</strong> (not safe for work).  I undertook the research because Coinhive’s code at the time was found on tens of thousands of hacked Web sites, and Coinhive seemed uninterested in curbing widespread abuse of its platform.</p>
<p>Pr0gramm’s top members accused KrebsOnSecurity of violating their privacy, even though all of the research published about them was publicly available online. In protest, the forum’s leaders urged members to donate money to medical research in a bid to find a cure for Krebs (i.e. “cancer”). <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/coinhive-expose-prompts-cancer-research-fundraiser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They ended up raising more than a quarter-million dollars worth of donations from members</a>.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s commemoration of the protest fundraiser &#8212; dubbed &#8220;<strong>Krebsaction</strong>&#8221; by Pr0gramm &#8212; raised almost $300,000 for anti-cancer research groups. Interestingly, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/crytpo-mining-service-coinhive-to-call-it-quits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinhive announced it was shutting down</a> around the same time as that second annual fundraiser.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s Krebsaction started roughly three days ago and so far has raised more than 150,000 euros (~$165,000), with many Pr0gramm members posting screenshots of their online donations. The primary beneficiary appears to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DKMS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DKMS</a>, a German nonprofit that works to combat various blood cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma.</p>
<div id="attachment_51104" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ka2020.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51104" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-51104" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ka2020.png" alt="" width="597" height="413" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-51104" class="wp-caption-text">The pr0gramm post kicking off this year&#8217;s &#8220;Krebsaction&#8221; fundraiser.</p></div>
<p>This year, however, Pr0gramm&#8217;s administrators exhorted forum members to go beyond just merely donating money to a worthy cause, and encouraged them to do something to help those most affected by the COVID-19/Coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year <span class="il">pr0gramm</span>-members shall not only donate but do a good act in terms of corona (and prove it), for example bring food to old people, bring proof of volunteering and such stuff,&#8221; reads the Pr0gramm image kicking off this year&#8217;s Krebsaction.  The message further states, &#8220;Posts mit geringem Einsatz können wir nicht akzeptieren,&#8221; which translates roughly to &#8220;Posts with little effort we cannot accept.&#8221;</p>

												<p>Federal investigators in Russia have charged at least 25 people accused of operating a sprawling international credit card theft ring. Cybersecurity experts say the raid included the charging of a major carding kingpin thought to be tied to dozens of carding shops and to some of the bigger data breaches targeting western retailers over the past decade.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/press/message/single.htm%21id%3D10438549%40fsbMessage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> released this week, the Russian <strong>Federal Security Service</strong> (FSB) said 25 individuals were charged with circulating illegal means of payment in connection with some 90 websites that sold stolen credit card data.</p>
<div id="attachment_51071" style="width: 602px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51071" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-51071" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fsb2.png" alt="" width="592" height="332" /><p id="caption-attachment-51071" class="wp-caption-text">A still image from a video of the raids released by the Russian FSB this week shows stacks of hundred dollar bills and cash counting machines seized at a residence of one of the accused.</p></div>
<p>The FSB has not released a list of those apprehended, but the agency&#8217;s statement came several days after details of the raids were first leaked on the LiveJournal blog of cybersecurity blogger <a href="https://sporaw.livejournal.com/678535.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrey Sporov</a>. The post claimed that among those apprehended was the infamous cybercriminal <strong>Alexey Stroganov, </strong>who goes by the hacker names &#8220;Flint&#8221; and &#8220;Flint24.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to cyber intelligence firm <a href="https://www.intel471.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel 471</a>, Stroganov has been a long-standing member of major underground forums since at least 2001. In 2006, Stroganov and an associate <strong>Gerasim Selivanov</strong> (a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Gabrik</strong>&#8220;) were sentenced to six years of confinement in Russia, but were set free just two years into their sentence. Intel 471 says <a href="https://mos-gorsud.ru/rs/tverskoj/services/cases/criminal-materials/details/e050d0a9-8799-42ff-b914-c40178abfd65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selivanov also was charged</a> <a href="https://mos-gorsud.ru/rs/tverskoj/services/cases/criminal-materials/details/b10673db-5554-458d-8e29-0958e9002b0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">along with Stroganov</a> in this past week&#8217;s law enforcement action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our continuous monitoring of underground activity revealed despite the conviction, Flint24 never left the cybercrime scene,&#8221; reads an analysis penned by Intel 471.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can draw your own conclusions [about why he was released early],&#8221; Sporaw wrote, suggesting that perhaps the accused bribed someone to get out of jail before his sentence was up.</p>
<p>Flint is among the biggest players in the crowded underground market for stolen credit card data, according to a U.S. law enforcement source who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The source described Flint&#8217;s role as that of a wholesaler of credit card data stolen in some of the biggest breaches at major Western retailers.</p>
<p>&#8220;He moved hundreds of millions of dollars through BTC-e,&#8221; the source said, referring to a cryptocurrency exchange that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTC-e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seized by U.S. authorities in 2017</a>. &#8220;<span class="pullquote pqleft">Flint had a piece of almost every major hack because in many cases it was his guys doing it.</span> Whether or not his marketplaces sold it, his crew had a role in a lot of the big breaches over the last ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intel 471&#8217;s analysis seemed to support that conclusion, noting that Flint worked closely with other major carding shops that were not his, and that he associated with a number of cybercrooks who regularly bought stolen credit cards in batches of 100,000 pieces at once.</p>
<p>Top denizens of several cybercrime forums who&#8217;ve been tracking the raids posited that Stroganov and others were busted because they had a habit of violating the golden rule for criminal hackers residing in Russia or in a former Soviet country: Don&#8217;t target your own country&#8217;s people and/or banks. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/03/russians-shut-down-huge-card-fraud-ring/#more-51069" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Many U.S. government Web sites now carry a message prominently at the top of their home pages meant to help visitors better distinguish between official U.S. government properties and phishing pages. Unfortunately, part of that message is misleading and may help perpetuate a popular misunderstanding about Web site security and trust that phishers have been exploiting for years now.</p>
<p>For example, the official <strong>U.S. Census Bureau</strong> website <a href="https://my2020census.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://my2020census.gov</a> carries a message that reads, &#8220;An official Web site of the United States government. Here&#8217;s how you know.&#8221; Clicking the last part of that statement brings up a panel with the following information:</p>
<div id="attachment_51037" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020census.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51037" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-51037" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020census.png" alt="" width="597" height="105" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-51037" class="wp-caption-text">A message displayed at the top of many U.S. .gov Web sites.</p></div>
<p>The text I have a beef with is the bit on the right, beneath the &#8220;This site is secure&#8221; statement. Specifically, it says, &#8220;The https:// ensures that you are connecting to the official website&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal: The https:// part of an address (also called “Secure Sockets Layer” or SSL) merely signifies the data being transmitted back and forth between your browser and the site is encrypted and cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<p>However, the presence of &#8220;https://&#8221; or a padlock in the browser address bar <em>does not mean the site is legitimate</em>, nor is it any proof the site has been security-hardened against intrusion from hackers.</p>
<p>In other words, while readers should never transmit sensitive information to a site that does not use https://, the presence of this security feature tells you nothing about the <em>trustworthiness</em> of the site in question.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sobering statistic: According to <strong>PhishLabs</strong>, <em>by the end of 2019 roughly three-quarters (74 percent) of all phishing sites were using SSL certificates</em>. PhishLabs <a href="https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/top-phishing-trends-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> this percentage increased from 68% in Q3 and 54% in Q2 of 2019. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/03/us-government-sites-give-bad-security-advice/#more-51035" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In December 2018, KrebsOnSecurity looked at how dozens of U.S. political campaigns, cities and towns had paid a shady company called <strong>Web Listings Inc.</strong> after <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/12/how-internet-savvy-are-your-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receiving what looked like a bill for search engine optimization (SEO) services</a> rendered on behalf of their domain names. The story concluded that this dubious service had been scamming people and companies for more than a decade, and promised a Part II to explore who was behind Web Listings. What follows are some clues that point to a very convincing answer to that question.</p>
<p>Since at least 2007, Web Listings Inc. has been sending snail mail letters to domain registrants around the world. The missives appear to be an $85 bill for an &#8220;annual search engine listing&#8221; service. The notice does disclose that it is in fact a solicitation and not a bill, but wording of the notice asserts the recipient has already received the services in question.</p>
<div id="attachment_45949" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45949" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45949" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wkbw.png" alt="" width="597" height="675" /><p id="caption-attachment-45949" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Better Business Bureau.</p></div>
<p>The mailer references the domain name <strong>web-listings.net</strong>, one of several similarly-named domains registered sometime in 2007 or later to a &#8220;<strong>James Madison</strong>,&#8221; who lists his address variously as a university in New Britain, Connecticut or a UPS Store mailbox in Niagara Falls, New York.</p>
<p>Some others include: <strong>weblistingservices.com</strong>, <strong>webservicescorp.net</strong>, <strong>websiteservicescorp.com</strong>, <strong>web-listingsinc.com</strong>, <strong>weblistingsinc.net</strong>, and <strong>weblistingsreports.net</strong>. At some point, each of these domains changes the owner&#8217;s name from James Madison to &#8220;<strong>Mark Carter</strong>.&#8221; As we&#8217;ll see, Mark is a name that comes up quite a bit in this investigation.</p>
<div id="attachment_45978" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45978" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45978" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bbb-webpayments.png" alt="" width="599" height="448" /><p id="caption-attachment-45978" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Better Business Bureau.</p></div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.twitter.com/weblistingsinc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account for Web Listings Inc.</a> has posts dating back to 2010, and points to even more Web Listings domains, including <strong>weblistingsinc.org</strong>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110518155957/http://www.weblistingsinc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cached versions of weblistingsinc.org at <strong>archive.org</strong></a> show logos similar to the one featured on the Web Listings mailer, and early versions of the site reference a number of &#8220;business partners&#8221; in India that also perform SEO services.</p>
<p>Searching the Internet for some of these Web listing domains mentioned in the company&#8217;s Twitter account brings up a series of press releases once issued on behalf of the company. One from May 2011 <a href="https://onlineprnews.com/news/142748-1306493005-web-listings-inc-new-promotion-services-will-bring-dramatic-change-to-small-businesses.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at onlineprnews.com</a> sings the praises of <strong>Weblistingsinc.info</strong>, weblistingsinc.org and web-listings.net in the same release, and lists the point of contact simply as &#8220;Mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>Historic WHOIS registration records from <a href="https://www.domaintools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domaintools</a> [an advertiser on this blog] say Weblistingsinc.org was registered in Nov. 2010 to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091228070928/http://www.blogger.com/profile/11526351081081042485" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Mark Scott </strong></a>in Blairgowrie, Scotland, using the email address <strong>clientnews@reputationmanagementfor.com</strong>.</p>
<p>Reputationmanagementfor.com bills itself as an online service for &#8220;fighting negative and incorrect content on the internet,&#8221; which is especially interesting for reasons that should become clearer in a few paragraphs. The site says Mark Scott, 46, is an employee of Reputationmanagementfor.com, and that he is also involved with two other companies:</p>
<p><strong>-GoBananas</strong>, a business that sets up group outings, with a focus on bachelor and bachelorette parties;</p>
<p><strong>-HelpMeGo.to</strong>, an entity in Scotland that did online marketing and travel tourism both in Scotland (via sites like Scotland.org.uk and marketinghotelsonline.co.uk) and on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070223043952/http://www.karmakerala.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">India&#8217;s coastal Kerala state</a> where HelpMeGo.to employed a number of people involved in the SEO business. Helpmego.to now simply redirects to GoBananas.</p>
