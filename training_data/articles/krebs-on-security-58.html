												<p>If you, a friend or loved one lost money in a scam involving <strong>Western Union</strong>, some or all of those funds may be recoverable thanks to a more than half-billion dollar program set up by the <strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</strong>.</p>
<p>In January 2017, Englewood, Colo.-based Western Union <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/western-union-admits-anti-money-laundering-violations-settles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled a case</a> with the FTC and the <strong>Department of Justice</strong> wherein it admitted to multiple criminal violations, including willfully failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and aiding and abetting wire fraud. As part of the settlement, the global money transfer business agreed to forfeit $586 million.</p>
<p>Last week, the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/11/ftc-alerts-consumers-if-scammers-had-you-pay-them-western-union?utm_source=slider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that individuals who lost money to scammers who told them to pay via Western Union’s money transfer system between January 1, 2004 and January 19, 2017 can now file a claim to get their money back by going to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/WU" data-ss1511181957="1">FTC.gov/WU</a> <em>before February 12, 2018</em>.</p>
<p>Scammers tend to rely on money transfer businesses like Western Union and <strong>MoneyGram</strong> because once the money is sent and picked up by the recipient the transaction is generally irreversible. Such scams include transfers made for fraudulent <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0199-prize-scams" data-ss1511181957="1">lottery and prizes</a>, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/imposters" data-ss1511181957="1">family emergencies</a>, <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0078-advance-fee-loans" data-ss1511181957="1">advance-fee loans</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0004-online-dating-scams" data-ss1511181957="1">online dating</a>, among others. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/fund-targets-victims-scammed-via-western-union/#more-41582" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>root9B Holdings</strong>, a company that many in the security industry consider little more than a big-name startup aimed at cashing in on the stock market&#8217;s insatiable appetite for cybersecurity firms, surprised no one this week when it announced it was ceasing operations at the end of the year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-41567" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/greatpress.png" alt="" width="500" height="392" /></p>
<p>Founded in 2011 as <strong>root9B Technologies</strong>,<strong> </strong>the company touted itself as an IT security training firm staffed by an impressive list of ex-military leaders with many years of cybersecurity experience at the <strong>Department of Defense</strong> and <strong>National Security Agency</strong> (NSA). As it began to attract more attention from investors, root9B&#8217;s focus shifted to helping organizations hunt for cyber intruders within their networks.</p>
<p>By 2015, root9B was announcing lucrative cybersecurity contracts with government agencies and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/root9b-technologies-acquires-ipsa-international-also-announces-73-million-investment-from-a-leading-financial-institution-300033448.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the infusion of millions from investors</a>. The company&#8217;s stock was ballooning in price, reaching an all-time high in mid-May 2015.</p>
<p>That was just days after root9B issued <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/root9b-uncovers-planned-sofacy-cyber-attack-targeting-several-international-and-domestic-financial-institutions-300081634.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a headline-grabbing report</a> about how its cyber intelligence had single-handedly derailed a planned Russian cyber attack on several U.S. financial institutions.</p>
<p>The report, released May 12, 2015, claimed root9B had uncovered plans by an infamous Russian hacking group to target several banks. The company said the thwarted operation was orchestrated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fancy Bear/Sofacy</a>, a so-called &#8220;advanced persistent threat&#8221; (APT) hacking group known for launching sophisticated phishing attacks aimed at infiltrating some of the world&#8217;s biggest corporations.  root9B released its Q1 2015 earnings two days later, reporting record revenues.</p>
<p>On May 20, 2015, KrebsOnSecurity published a rather visceral dissection of that root9B report: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/security-firm-redefines-apt-african-phishing-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Firm Redefines APT; African Phishing Threat</a>. The story highlighted the thinness of the report&#8217;s claims, pointing to multiple contradictory findings by other security firms which suggested the company had merely detected several new phishing domains being erected by a comparatively low-skilled African phishing gang that was well-known to investigators and U.S. banks.</p>
<p>In mid-June 2015, an anonymous researcher who&#8217;d apparently done a rather detailed investigation into root9B&#8217;s finances said the company was &#8220;a worthless reverse-merger created by insiders with [a] long history of penny-stock wipeouts, fraud allegations, and disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/3258735-root9-minus-82_5-percent-downside-on-management-fraud-allegations-cyber-failure-and-bankruptcy-strong-sell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That report</a>, published by the crowd-sourced financial market research site <strong>SeekingAlpha.com</strong>, sought to debunk claims by root9B that it possessed &#8220;proprietary&#8221; cybersecurity hardware and software, noting that the company mainly acts as a reseller of a training module produced by a third party.</p>
<p>root9B&#8217;s stock price never recovered from those reports, and began a slow but steady decline after mid-2015. In Dec. 2016, root9B Technologies announced a reverse split of its issued and outstanding common stock, saying it would be moving to the <strong>NASDAQ</strong> market with the trading symbol <strong>RTNB</strong> and a new name &#8212; <strong>root9B Holdings</strong>. On January 18, 2017, a reshuffled root9B <a href="https://www.root9b.com/newsroom/root9b-holdings-inc-nasdaq-rtnb-ring-nasdaq-stock-market-opening-bell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rang the market opening bell</a> at NASDAQ, and got a bounce when it said it&#8217;d been awarded a five-year training contract to support the U.S. Defense Department. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/r-i-p-root9b-we-hardly-knew-ya/#more-41516" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>It&#8217;s Nov. 14 &#8212; the second Tuesday of the month (a.k.a. &#8220;Patch Tuesday) &#8212; and <strong>Adobe</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> have issued gobs of security updates for their software. Microsoft&#8217;s 11 patch bundles fix more than four-dozen security holes in various <strong>Windows</strong> versions and <strong>Office</strong> products &#8212; including at least four serious flaws that were publicly disclosed prior to today. Meanwhile, Adobe&#8217;s got security updates available for a slew of titles, including <strong>Flash Player</strong>, <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Reader</strong> and <strong>Shockwave</strong>.</p>

												<p>A KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=talx&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series</a> on how easy big-three credit bureau <strong>Equifax</strong> makes it to get detailed salary history data on tens of millions of Americans apparently inspired a deeper dive on the subject by <em>Fast Company</em>, which examined how this Equifax division has been one of the company&#8217;s best investments. In this post, I&#8217;ll show you how to opt out of yet another Equifax service that makes money at the expense of your privacy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-40776" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifax-hq-580x384.png" alt="" width="580" height="384" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifax-hq-580x384.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifax-hq-768x509.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifax-hq.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>My <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/equifax-breach-fallout-your-salary-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original report</a> showed how the salary history for tens of millions of employees at some of the world&#8217;s largest corporations was available to anyone armed with an employee&#8217;s Social Security number and date of birth &#8212; information that was stolen on 145.5 million Americans in the recent breach at Equifax.</p>
<p>Equifax took down their salary portal &#8212; a service from the company&#8217;s <strong>Workforce Solutions</strong> division known as <strong>The Work Number</strong> (formerly &#8220;<strong>TALX</strong>&#8220;) &#8212; just a few hours after my story went live on Oct. 8. The company explained that the site was being disabled for routine maintenance, but Equifax <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/equifax-reopens-salary-lookup-service/">didn&#8217;t fully reopen the portal until Nov. 2</a>, following the addition of unspecified &#8220;security improvements.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Fast Company</em> writer <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40485634/equifax-salary-data-and-the-work-number-database" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joel Winston&#8217;s story</a> examines how some 70,000 companies &#8212; including <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Oracle</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>Wal-Mart</strong> &#8212; actually pay Equifax to collect, organize, and re-sell their employees’ personal income information and work history.</p>
<p>&#8220;A typical employee at Facebook (which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp) may require verification of his employment through TALX when he leases an apartment, updates his immigration status, applies for a loan or public aid, or applies for a new job,&#8221; Winston writes. &#8220;If his new prospective employer is among the 70,000 approved entities in Equifax’s verifier network with a “permissible purpose,” that company can purchase his employment and income information for about $20.&#8221;</p>
<p>While this may sound like a nice and legitimate use of salary data, the point of my original report was that this salary data is also available to anyone who has the Social Security number and date of birth on virtually any person who once worked at a company that uses this Equifax service.</p>
<p>In May 2017, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/fraudsters-exploited-lax-security-at-equifaxs-talx-payroll-division/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the story</a> of how this same Equifax Workforce portal was abused for an entire year by identity thieves involved in tax refund fraud with the <strong>Internal Revenue Service</strong>. Fraudsters used SSN and DOB data to reset the 4-digit PINs given to customer employees as a password, and then steal W-2 tax data after successfully answering personal questions about those employees.</p>
<p>Curiously, Equifax claims they have no evidence that anyone was harmed as a result of the year-long pattern of tax fraud related to how easy it was to coax salary and payroll data out of its systems.</p>
<p>“We do not know of any specific fraud incidents linked with the Work Number,” Equifax spokeswoman <strong>Marisa Salcines</strong> told <em>Fast Company</em>.</p>
<p>This statement sounds suspiciously like what big-three credit bureau <strong>Experian</strong> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/03/experian-lapse-allowed-id-theft-service-to-access-200-million-consumer-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told lawmakers in 2014 after they were hauled up to Capitol Hill</a> to explain another breach that was scooped by KrebsOnSecurity: That <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/10/experian-sold-consumer-data-to-id-theft-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Vietnamese man who ran an identity theft service</a> which catered to tax refund fraudsters <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/10/experian-sold-consumer-data-to-id-theft-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had access for nine months to more than 200 million consumer records maintained by Experian</a>.</p>
<p>Experian&#8217;s suits told lawmakers that no consumers were harmed even as the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> was busy <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/04/an-allegation-of-harm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arresting customers</a> of this identity theft service &#8212; nearly all of whom were involved in tax refund fraud and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/experian-breach-tied-to-ny-nj-id-theft-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other forms of consumer ID theft</a>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/how-to-opt-out-of-equifax-revealing-your-salary-history/#more-41495" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A New Mexico man is facing federal hacking charges for allegedly using the now defunct attack-for-hire service <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=vdos&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vDOS</a> to launch damaging digital assaults aimed at knocking his former employer&#8217;s Web site offline. Prosecutors were able to bring the case in part because vDOS got massively hacked last year, and its customer database of payments and targets leaked to this author and to the FBI.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Minnesota have charged <strong>John Kelsey Gammell</strong>, 46, with using vDOS and other online attack services to hurl a year&#8217;s worth of attack traffic at the Web sites associated with<strong> Washburn Computer Group</strong>, a Minnesota-based company where Gammell used to work.</p>
<div id="attachment_36386" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36386" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-36386" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/vdosloggedin-580x405.png" alt="" width="580" height="405" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/vdosloggedin-580x405.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/vdosloggedin-768x536.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/vdosloggedin.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-36386" class="wp-caption-text">vDOS as it existed on Sept. 8, 2016.</p></div>
<p>vDOS existed for nearly four years, and was known as one of the most powerful and effective pay-to-play tools for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The vDOS owners used a variety of methods to power their service, including at least one massive botnet consisting of tens of thousands of hacked Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as compromised Internet routers and security cameras. vDOS also was used in numerous DDoS attacks against this site.</p>
<p>Investigators allege that although Gammell used various methods to hide his identity, email addresses traced back to him were found in the hacked user and target databases from vDOS.</p>
<p>More importantly, prosecutors say, someone began taunting Washburn via Yahoo and Gmail messages while the attacks were underway, asking how everything was going at the company and whether the IT department needed any help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also attached to this second email was an image of a mouse laughing,&#8221; the Justice Department <a href="http://ia800808.us.archive.org/30/items/gov.uscourts.mnd.165131/gov.uscourts.mnd.165131.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indictment</a> (PDF) alleges. &#8220;Grand jury subpoenas for subscriber information were subsequently served on Google&#8230;and Yahoo. Analysis of the results showed information connecting both accounts to an individual named John Gammell. Both email addresses were created using the cell phone number 612-205-8609.&#8221;</p>
<p>The complaint notes that the government subpoenaed AT&amp;T for subscriber information and traced that back to Gammell as well, but phone number also is currently listed as the recovery number for a Facebook account tied to John K. Gammell.</p>
<p>That Facebook account features numerous references to the hacker collective known as Anonymous. This is notable because according to the government Gammell used two different accounts at vDOS: One named &#8220;AnonCunnilingus&#8221; and another called &#8220;anonrooster.&#8221; The email addresses this user supplied when signing up at vDOS (jkgammell@gmail.com and jkgammell@icloud.com) include other addresses quite clearly tied to multiple accounts for John K. Gammell.</p>
<div id="attachment_41484" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41484" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-41484" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jkg.png" alt="" width="598" height="333" /><p id="caption-attachment-41484" class="wp-caption-text">John K. Gammell&#8217;s Facebook account.</p></div>
<p>Below is a snippet from a customer service ticket that the AnonCunnilingus account filed in Aug. 2015</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Dear Colleagues, this is Mr. Cunnilingus. You underestimate your capabilities. Contrary to your statement of &#8220;Notice!&#8221; It appears from our review that you are trying to stress test a DDoS protected host, vDOS stresser is not capable of taking DDoS protected hosts down which means you will not be able to drop this hosting using vDOS stresser&#8230;As they do not have my consent to use my internet, after their site being down for two days, they changed their IP and used rackspace DDoS mitigation and must now be removed from cyberspace. Verified by downbyeveryone. We will do much business. Thank you for your outstanding product 🙂 We Are Anonymous USA.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Gammell has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He has not responded to requests for comment. The indictment states that Gammell allegedly attacked at least a half-dozen other companies over a year-long period between mid-2015 and July 2016, including several banks and two other companies at which he either previously worked or with whom he&#8217;d interviewed for a job. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/hack-of-attack-for-hire-service-vdos-snares-new-mexico-man/#more-41451" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In May 2013 KrebsOnSecurity wrote about <strong>Ragebooter</strong>, a service that paying customers can use to launch powerful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks capable of knocking individuals and Web sites offline. The owner of Ragebooter subsequently was convicted in 2016 of possessing child pornography, but his business somehow lived on while he was in prison. Now just weeks after Poland made probation, a mobile version of the attack-for-hire service has gone up for sale on the <strong>Google Play</strong> store.</p>
<p>In the story <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/05/ragebooter-legit-ddos-service-or-fed-backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragebooter: &#8216;Legit&#8217; DDoS Service, or Fed Backdoor</a>, I profiled then 19-year-old <strong>Justin D. Poland</strong> from Memphis &#8212; who admitted to installing code on his Ragebooter service that allowed FBI investigators to snoop on his customers.</p>
<p>Last February, Poland was convicted of one felony count of possession of child pornography, after investigators reportedly found 2,600 child pornography images on one of his computers. Before his trial was over, Poland skipped town but his bondsman later located him at his mother&#8217;s house. He was sentenced to two years in jail.</p>
<p>Poland did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PRIMALRAGE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on his Facebook account</a> Poland said the images belonged to his former roommate &#8212; <strong>David Starliper</strong> &#8212; who&#8217;d allegedly used Poland&#8217;s computer. Starliper also was convicted of possessing child pornography and sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
<p>In September 2017, Poland began posting on his Facebook account that he had made parole and was getting ready to be released from prison. On Oct. 6, the first version of the Android edition of Ragebooter was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wRageBooterDDoSStressTestingTool_5756676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put on sale at Google&#8217;s Play Store</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_41469" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41469" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-41469 " src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ragebooterplaystore.png" alt="" width="593" height="521" /><p id="caption-attachment-41469" class="wp-caption-text">The mobile version of Ragebooter.</p></div>
<p>Poland&#8217;s Facebook page says he is the owner of ragebooter[dot]com, ragebooter[dot]net, and another site called vmdeploy[net]. The advertisement for Ragebooter&#8217;s new mobile app on Google Play says the developer&#8217;s email address is <strong>contact@rageservices[dot]net</strong>. The registration details for rageservices[dot]net are hidden, but the Web site lists some useful contact details.</p>
<p>One of them is a phone number registered in Memphis &#8212; 901-219-3644 &#8212; that is tied to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100012337922494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Facebook account</a> for an <strong>Alex Slovak</strong> in Memphis. The other domain Poland mentions on his Facebook page &#8212; vmdeploy[dot]net &#8212; was registered to an <strong>Alex Czech</strong> from Memphis. It seems likely that Alex has been running Ragebooter while Poland was in prison. Mr. Slovak/Czech did not respond to requests for comment, but it is clear from his Facebook page that he is friends with Poland&#8217;s family. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/ddos-for-hire-service-launches-mobile-app/#more-41204" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>There was a time when I was content to let my bank authenticate me over the phone by asking for some personal identifiers (SSN/DOB) that are broadly for sale in the cybercrime underground. At some point, however, I decided this wasn&#8217;t acceptable for institutions that held significant chunks of our money, and I began taking our business away from those that wouldn&#8217;t let me add a simple verbal passphrase that needed to be uttered before any account details could be discussed over the phone.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-41426" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vpwd.png" alt="" width="288" height="262" />Most financial institutions will let customers add verbal passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) that are separate from any other PIN or online banking password you might use, although few will advertise this.</p>
<p>Even so, many institutions don&#8217;t properly train their customer support staff (or have high turnover in that department). This can allow clever and insistent crooks to coax customer service reps into validating the call with just the SSN and/or date of birth, or requiring the correct answers to so-called <strong>knowledge-based authentication</strong> (KBA) questions.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=kba&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several stories here previously</a>, identity thieves can reliably work around KBA because it involves answering  questions about things like previous loans, addresses and co-residents &#8212; information that can often be gleaned from online services or social media.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I began testing financial institutions that held our personal assets. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that most of them were happy to add a PIN or pass phrase to the account. But many of the customer service personnel at those institutions failed in their responses when I called in and said I didn&#8217;t remember the phrase and was there any other way they could verify that I was me?</p>
<p>Ultimately, I ended up moving our investments to an institution that consistently adhered to my requirements. Namely, that failing to provide the pass phrase required an in-person visit to a bank branch to continue the transaction, at which time ID would be requested. Their customer service folks consistently asked the right questions, and weren&#8217;t interested in being much helpful otherwise (I&#8217;m not going to name the institution for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>Not sure whether your financial institution supports verbal passwords? Ask them. If they agree to set one up for you, take a moment or two over the next few days to call in and see if you can get the customer service folks at that institution to talk about your account without hearing that password. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/simple-banking-security-tip-verbal-passwords/#more-40980" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>For the second time in as many years, hackers have compromised <strong>Verticalscope.com</strong>, a Canadian company that manages hundreds of popular Web discussion forums totaling more than 45 million user accounts. Evidence of the breach was discovered just before someone began using that illicit access as a commercial for a new paid search service that indexes consumer information exposed in corporate data breaches.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Verticalscope runs a network of sites that cater to automotive, pets, sports and technology markets. Verticalscope <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/leakedsourcecom-finds-45m-leaked-verticalscope-user-records/article/529437/">acknowledged in June 2016</a> that a hacking incident led to the siphoning of 45 million user accounts. Now, it appears the company may have been hit again, this time in a breach involving at least 2.7 million user accounts.</p>
<p>On Thursday, KrebsOnSecurity was contacted by <strong>Alex Holden</strong>, a security researcher and founder of <a href="https://www.holdsecurity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hold Security</a>. Holden saw evidence of hackers selling access to Verticalscope.com and to a host of other sites operated by the company.</p>
<p>Holden said at first he suspected someone was merely trying to resell data stolen in the 2016 breach. But that was before he contacted one of the hackers selling the data and was given screen shots indicating that Verticalscope.com and several other properties were in fact compromised with a backdoor known as a &#8220;Web shell.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_41369" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vertscope-shell.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41369" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-41369" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vertscope-shell.png" alt="" width="599" height="380" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-41369" class="wp-caption-text">A backdoor &#8220;Web shell&#8221; discovered on Verticalscope.com this week.</p></div>
<p>With a Web shell installed on a site, anyone can remotely administer the site, upload and delete content at will, or dump entire databases of information &#8212; such as usernames, passwords, email addresses and Internet addresses associated with each account.</p>
<p>Holden said the intruders obfuscated certain details in the screenshots that gave away exactly where the Web shells were hidden on Verticalscope.com, but that they forgot to blur out a few critical details &#8212; allowing him to locate at least two backdoors on Veriticalscope&#8217;s Web site. He also was able to do the same with a second screen shot the hackers shared which showed a similar backdoor shell on <strong>Toyotanation.com</strong>, one of Verticalscope&#8217;s most-visited forums.</p>
<p>Reached for comment about the claims, Verticalscope said the company had detected an intrusion on six of its Web sites, including Toyotanation.com.</p>
<p>&#8220;The intrusion granted access to each individual website files,&#8221; reads a statement shared by Verticalscope. &#8220;Out of an abundance of caution, we have removed the file manager, expired all passwords on the 6 websites in question, added the malicious file pattern and attack vector to our detection tools, and taken additional steps to lock down access.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verticalscope said the other forums impacted included <strong>Jeepforum.com</strong> &#8212; the company&#8217;s second most-popular site; and <strong>watchuseek.com</strong>, a forum for wristwatch enthusiasts. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/2nd-breach-at-verticalscope-impacts/#more-41365" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Equifax</strong> has re-opened a Web site that lets anyone look up the salary history of a large portion of the American workforce using little more than a person&#8217;s Social Security number and their date of birth. The big-three credit bureau took the site down just hours after <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/equifax-breach-fallout-your-salary-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote about it on Oct. 8</a>, and began restoring the site eight days later saying it had added unspecified &#8220;security enhancements.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_41054" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41054" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-41054" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-580x226.png" alt="" width="580" height="226" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-580x226.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn-768x300.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/twn.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-41054" class="wp-caption-text">The Work Number, Equifax&#8217;s salary and employment history portal.</p></div>
<p>At issue is a service provided by Equifax’s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=talx&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TALX division</a> called <a href="https://www.theworknumber.com/Employees/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Work Number</a>. The service is designed to provide automated employment and income verification for prospective employers, and tens of thousands of companies report employee salary data to it. The Work Number also allows anyone whose employer uses the service to provide proof of their income when purchasing a home or applying for a loan.</p>
<p>What’s needed to access your salary and employment history? <a href="https://secure.theworknumber.talx.com/twneeer/PreAuthenticated/EnterEmployerSearchCriteria.ascx?ReturnUrl=%2ftwneeer%2femployee%2fpostauthenticated%2fapplicationsequenceerror.ascx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go here</a>, and enter the employer name or employer code. After that, it asks for a “user ID.” This might sound like privileged information, but in most cases this is just the employees’s Social Security number (or a portion of it).</p>
<p>At the next step, the site asks visitors to “enter your PIN,” short for Personal Identification Number. However, in the vast majority of cases this appears to be little more than someone’s eight-digit date of birth. The formats differ by employer, but it’s usually either yyyy/mm/dd or mm/dd/yyyy, without the slashes.</p>
<p>Successful validation to the system produces two sets of data: An employee’s salary and employment history going back at least a decade, and a report listing all of the entities (ostensibly, the aforementioned “credentialed verifiers”) that have previously requested and viewed this information.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/equifax-restoring-the-work-number-portal-with-beefed-up-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a story</a> in the financial industry publication <em>National Mortgage News</em>, Equifax said:  &#8220;As access to the employee portal is restored, individuals must be re-authenticated and establish a unique PIN. Therefore, the data exposed in the cyber incident will not be sufficient to access The Work Number.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/11/equifax-reopens-salary-lookup-service/#more-41208" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Last week we looked at <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports from China and Israel</a> about a new &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; malware strain called &#8220;<strong>Reaper</strong>&#8221; that researchers said infected more than a million organizations by targeting newfound security weaknesses in countless Internet routers, security cameras and digital video recorders (DVRs). Now some botnet experts are calling on people to stop the &#8220;Reaper Madness,&#8221; saying the actual number of IoT devices infected with Reaper right now is much smaller.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41329" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/reapermadness.png" alt="" width="483" height="311" />Arbor Networks</strong> said it believes the size of the Reaper botnet currently fluctuates between 10,000 and 20,000 bots total. Arbor notes that this can change any time.</p>
<p>Reaper was based in part on &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=Mirai&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirai</a>,&#8221; IoT malware code designed to knock Web sites offline in high-powered data floods, and an IoT malware strain that powered most of the largest cyberattacks of the past year. So it&#8217;s worrisome to think someone may have just built an army of a million IoT drones that could be used in crippling, coordinated assaults capable of wiping most networks offline.</p>
<p>If criminals haven&#8217;t yet built a million-strong botnet using the current pool of vulnerable devices, they certainly have the capacity to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;An additional 2 million hosts have been identified by the botnet scanners as potential Reaper nodes, but have not been subsumed into the botnet,&#8221; Arbor&#8217;s ASERT team wrote, explaining that the coders may have intentionally slowed the how quickly the malware can spread to keep it quiet and under the radar.</p>
<p>Arbor says Reaper is likely being built to serve as the machine powering a giant attack-for-hire service known as a &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=booter&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">booter</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=stresser&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stresser</a>&#8221; service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our current assessment of Reaper is that it is likely intended for use as a booter/stresser service primarily serving the intra-China DDoS-for-hire market,&#8221; Arbor wrote. &#8220;Reaper appears to be a product of the Chinese criminal underground; some of the general Reaper code is based on the <a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/mirai-iot-botnet-description-ddos-attack-mitigation/" data-ss1509127502="1">Mirai</a> IoT malware, but it is not an outright Mirai clone.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/fear-the-reaper-or-reaper-madness/#more-41321" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
