												<p><strong>Dahua</strong>, the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; devices like security cameras and digital video recorders (DVRs), has shipped a software update that closes a gaping security hole in a broad swath of its products. The vulnerability allows anyone to bypass the login process for these devices and gain remote, direct control over vulnerable systems. Adding urgency to the situation, there is now code available online that allows anyone to exploit this bug and commandeer a large number of IoT devices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-38431" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dahua.png" alt="dahua" width="254" height="219" />On March 5, a security researcher named <strong>Bashis</strong> posted to <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Mar/7" target="_blank">the Full Disclosure security mailing list</a> exploit code for an embarrassingly simple flaw in the way many Dahua security cameras and DVRs handle authentication. These devices are designed to be controlled by a local Web server that is accessible via a Web browser.</p>
<p>That server requires the user to enter a username and password, but Bashis found he could force all affected devices to cough up their usernames and a simple hashed value of the password. Armed with this information, he could effectively &#8220;pass the hash&#8221; and the corresponding username right back to the Web server and be admitted access to the device settings page. From there, he could add users and install or modify the device&#8217;s software. From Full Disclosure:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is so simple as:<br />
1. Remotely download the full user database with all credentials and permissions<br />
2. Choose whatever admin user, copy the login names and password hashes<br />
3. Use them as source to remotely login to the Dahua devices</p>
<p>&#8220;This is like a damn Hollywood hack, click on one button and you are in&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bashis said he was so appalled at the discovery that he labeled it an apparent &#8220;backdoor&#8221; &#8212; an undocumented means of accessing an electronic device that often only the vendor knows about. Enraged, Bashis decided to publish his exploit code without first notifying Dahua. Later, Bashis said he changed his mind after being contacted by the company and agreed to remove his code from the online posting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that ship may have already sailed. Bashis&#8217;s exploit code already has been copied in several other places online as of this publication.</p>
<p>Asked why he took down his exploit code, Bashis said in an interview with KrebsOnSecurity that &#8220;The hack is too simple, way too simple, and now I want Dahua&#8217;s users to get patched firmware’s before they will be victims to some botnet.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an advisory published March 6, Dahua said it has identified nearly a dozen of its products that are vulnerable, and that further review may reveal additional models also have this flaw. The company is urging users to <a href="http://us.dahuasecurity.com/en/us/Security-Bulletin_030617.php" target="_blank">download and install the newest firmware updates</a> as soon as possible. Here are the models known to be affected so far:</p>
<p>DH-IPC-HDW23A0RN-ZS<br />
DH-IPC-HDBW23A0RN-ZS<br />
DH-IPC-HDBW13A0SN<br />
DH-IPC-HDW13A0SN<br />
DH-IPC-HFW13A0SN-W<br />
DH-IPC-HDBW13A0SN<br />
DH-IPC-HDW13A0SN<br />
DH-IPC-HFW13A0SN-W<br />
DHI-HCVR51A04HE-S3<br />
DHI-HCVR51A08HE-S3<br />
DHI-HCVR58A32S-S2</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly how many devices worldwide may be vulnerable. Bashis says that&#8217;s a difficult question to answer, but that he &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if 95 percent of Dahua&#8217;s product line has the same problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And also possible their OEM clones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dahua has not yet responded to my questions or request for comment. I&#8217;ll update this post if things change on that front.</p>
<p>This is the second time in a week that a major Chinese IoT firm has urgently warned its customers to update the firmware on their devices. For weeks, experts have been warning that there are signs of attackers exploiting an unknown backdoor or equally serious vulnerability in cameras and DVR devices made by IoT giant <strong>Hikvision</strong>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/dahua-hikvision-iot-devices-under-siege/#more-38363" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>When <strong>WikiLeaks</strong> on Tuesday <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/wikileaks-dumps-docs-on-cias-hacking-tools/" target="_blank">dumped thousands of files</a> documenting hacking tools used by the <strong>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency</strong>, many feared WikiLeaks would soon publish a trove of so-called &#8220;zero days,&#8221; the actual computer code that the CIA uses to exploit previously unknown flaws in a range of software and hardware products used by consumers and businesses. But on Thursday, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief <strong>Julian Assange</strong> promised that his organization would work with hardware and software vendors to fix the security weaknesses prior to releasing additional details about the flaws.</p>
<p>&#8220;After considering what we think is the best way to proceed, and hearing these calls from some of the manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them exclusive access to additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out,&#8221; Assange said in a press conference put on by his organization. &#8220;Once this material is effectively disarmed by us, we will publish additional details about what has been occurring.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_38417" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38417" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-38417" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wiki0day-580x479.png" alt="Source: Twitter" width="580" height="479" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wiki0day-580x479.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wiki0day.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-38417" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Twitter</p></div>
<p>So-called &#8220;zero-day&#8221; flaws refer to vulnerabilities in hardware or software products that vendors first learn about when those flaws are already under active attack (i.e., the vendor has &#8220;zero days&#8221; to fix the vulnerability before it begins affecting its customers and users). Zero-day flaws are highly prized by cybercriminals and nation states alike because they potentially allow attackers to stealthily bypass a target&#8217;s digital defenses.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if WikiLeak&#8217;s decision to work with software makers on zero-days was impacted by a poll the organization took via its Twitter page over the past few days. The tweet read: &#8220;Tech companies are saying they need more details of CIA attack techniques to fix them faster. Should WikiLeaks work directly with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, just over 38,000 people have responded, with a majority (57 percent) saying &#8220;Yes, make people safe,&#8221; while only 36 percent selected &#8220;no, they&#8217;re part of the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Assange didn&#8217;t offer additional details about the proposed information-sharing process he described, such as whether WikiLeaks would seek to work with affected vendors individually or if it might perhaps rely on a trusted third-party or third-parties to assist in that process. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/wikileaks-well-work-with-software-makers-on-zero-days/#more-38414" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>WikiLeaks</strong> on Tuesday dropped one of its most explosive word bombs ever: A secret trove of documents apparently stolen from the <strong>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</strong> detailing methods of hacking everything from smart phones and TVs to compromising Internet routers and computers. KrebsOnSecurity is still digesting much of this fascinating data cache, but here are some first impressions based on what I&#8217;ve seen so far.</p>
<p>First, to quickly recap what happened: In a post on its site, WikiLeaks said the release &#8212; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/" target="_blank">dubbed &#8220;Vault 7&#8221;</a> &#8212; was the largest-ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. WikiLeaks is promising a series of these document caches; this first one includes more than 8,700 files allegedly taken from a high-security network inside <strong>CIA&#8217;s Center for Cyber Intelligence</strong> in Langley, Va.</p>
<div id="attachment_38380" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38380" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-38380" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/samsung-cia-580x424.png" alt="The home page for the CIA's &quot;Weeping Angel&quot; project, which sought to exploit flaws that could turn certain 2013-model Samsung &quot;smart&quot; TVs into remote listening posts." width="580" height="424" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/samsung-cia-580x424.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/samsung-cia-768x561.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/samsung-cia-940x686.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/samsung-cia.png 997w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-38380" class="wp-caption-text">The home page for the CIA&#8217;s &#8220;Weeping Angel&#8221; project, which sought to exploit flaws that could turn certain 2013-model Samsung &#8220;smart&#8221; TVs into remote listening posts.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized &#8216;zero day&#8217; exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation,&#8221; WikiLeaks wrote. &#8220;This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wikileaks said it was calling attention to the CIA&#8217;s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of weaponized exploits against &#8220;a wide range of U.S. and European company products, includ[ing] Apple&#8217;s iPhone, Google&#8217;s Android and Microsoft&#8217;s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The documents for the most part don&#8217;t appear to include the computer code needed to exploit previously unknown flaws in these products, although WikiLeaks says those exploits may show up in a future dump. This collection is probably best thought of as an internal corporate wiki used by multiple CIA researchers who methodically found and documented weaknesses in a variety of popular commercial and consumer electronics.</p>
<p>For example, the data dump lists a number of exploit &#8220;modules&#8221; available to compromise various models of consumer routers made by companies like <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=linksys&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=&amp;document_date_end=&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;publication_type%5B%5D=51&amp;new_search=False&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results" target="_blank">Linksys</a>, <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=microtik&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=&amp;document_date_end=&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;publication_type%5B%5D=51&amp;new_search=False&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results" target="_blank">Microtik</a> and <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=Zyxel&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=&amp;document_date_end=&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;publication_type%5B%5D=51&amp;new_search=False&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results" target="_blank">Zyxel</a>, to name a few. CIA researchers also collated several pages worth of probing and testing weaknesses in business-class devices from <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=cisco&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=&amp;document_date_end=&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;publication_type%5B%5D=51&amp;new_search=False&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results" target="_blank">Cisco</a><strong>, </strong>whose powerful routers carry a decent portion of the Internet&#8217;s traffic on any given day. <strong>Craig Dods</strong>, a researcher with Cisco&#8217;s rival <strong>Juniper</strong>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cia-hacking-tools-review-cisco-primary-target-craig-dods" target="_blank">delves into greater detail</a> on the Cisco bugs for anyone interested (Dods says he found no exploits for Juniper products in the cache, yet). Meanwhile, Cisco has <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/security/the-wikileaks-vault-7-leak-what-we-know-so-far" target="_blank">published its own blog post</a> on the matter.</p>
<h4>WHILE MY SMART TV GENTLY WEEPS</h4>
<p>Some of the exploits discussed in these leaked CIA documents appear to reference full-on, remote access vulnerabilities. However, a great many of the documents I&#8217;ve looked at seem to refer to attack concepts or half-finished exploits that may be limited by very specific requirements &#8212; such as physical access to the targeted device.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<strong>Weeping Angel</strong>&#8221; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_12353643.html" target="_blank">project&#8217;s page</a> from 2014 is a prime example: It discusses ways to turn certain 2013-model <strong>Samsung</strong> &#8220;smart TVs&#8221; into remote listening devices; methods for disabling the LED lights that indicate the TV is on; and suggestions for fixing a problem with the exploit in which the WiFi interface on the TV is disabled when the exploit is run.</p>
<blockquote><p>ToDo / Future Work:<br />
Build a console cable</p>
<p>Turn on or leave WiFi turned on in Fake-Off mode</p>
<p>Parse unencrypted audio collection<br />
Clean-up the file format of saved audio. Add encryption??</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the documentation, Weeping Angel worked as long as the target hadn&#8217;t upgraded the firmware on the Samsung TVs. It also said the firmware upgrade eliminated the &#8220;current installation method,&#8221; which apparently required the insertion of a booby-trapped USB device into the TV.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: This is a serious leak of fairly sensitive information. And I sincerely hope Wikileaks decides to work with researchers and vendors to coordinate the patching of flaws leveraged by the as-yet unreleased exploit code archive that apparently accompanies this documentation from the CIA.</p>
<p>But in reading the media coverage of this leak, one might be led to believe that even if you are among the small minority of Americans who have chosen to migrate more of their communications to privacy-enhancing technologies like <strong>Signal</strong> or <strong>WhatsApp</strong>, it&#8217;s all futility because the CIA can break it anyway.</p>
<p>Perhaps a future cache of documents from this CIA division will change things on this front, but an admittedly cursory examination of these documents indicates that the CIA&#8217;s methods for weakening the privacy of these tools all seem to require attackers to first succeed in deeply subverting the security of the mobile device &#8212; either through a remote-access vulnerability in the underlying operating system or via physical access to the target&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>As Bloomberg&#8217;s tech op-ed writer <strong>Leonid Bershidsky</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-08/wikileaks-cia-revelations-look-like-a-dud-for-now" target="_blank">notes</a>, the documentation released here shows that these attacks are &#8220;not about mass surveillance &#8212; something that should bother the vast majority of internet users &#8212; but about monitoring specific targets.&#8221;</p>
<p>By way of example, Bershidsky points to <a href="https://twitter.com/whispersystems/status/839204754718932992" target="_blank">a tweet yesterday</a> from <strong>Open Whisper Systems</strong> (the makers of the Signal private messaging app) which observes that, &#8220;The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company went on to say that because more online services are now using end-to-end encryption to prevent prying eyes from reading communications that are intercepted in-transit, intelligence agencies are being pushed &#8220;from undetectable mass surveillance to expensive, high-risk, targeted attacks.&#8221;</p>

												<p>Credit and debit card payments giant <strong>Verifone</strong> [<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22verifone+largest%22&amp;oq=%22verifone+largest%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.5583j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=NYSE:PAY&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNzKtyLC0seADs-Rb9OgAAAA&amp;*" target="_blank">NYSE: PAY</a>] is investigating a breach of its internal computer networks that appears to have impacted a number of companies running its point-of-sale solutions, according to sources. Verifone says the extent of the breach was limited to its corporate network and that its payment services network was not impacted.</p>
<p>San Jose, Calif.-based Verifone is the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/once-the-credit-card-reader-to-beat-verifone-is-losing-its-grip" target="_blank">largest</a> maker of credit card terminals used in the United States. It sells point-of-sale terminals and services to support the swiping and processing of credit and debit card payments at a variety of businesses, including retailers, taxis, and fuel stations.</p>
<p>On Jan. 23, 2017, Verifone sent an &#8220;urgent&#8221; email to all company staff and contractors, warning they had 24 hours to change all company passwords.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently investigating an IT control matter in the Verifone environment,&#8221; reads an email memo penned by <strong>Steve Horan</strong>, Verifone Inc.&#8217;s senior vice president and chief information officer. &#8220;As a precaution, we are taking immediate steps to improve our controls.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_38316" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/verif1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38316" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-38316 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/verif1-580x706.png" alt="An internal memo sent by Verifone's chief information officer to all staff and contractors, telling them to change their passwords.

The memo also states that Verifone employees would no longer be able to install software at will, apparently something everyone at the company could do prior to this notice.</p></div>
<p>The internal Verifone memo &#8212; a copy of which was obtained by KrebsOnSecurity and is pictured above &#8212; also informed employees they would no longer be allowed to install software of any kind on company computers and laptops.</p>
<p>Asked about the breach reports, a Verifone spokesman said the company saw evidence in January 2017 of an intrusion in a &#8220;limited portion&#8221; of its internal network, but that the breach never impacted its payment services network.</p>
<div id="attachment_38321" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/verifonefuel.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38321" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-38321" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/verifonefuel-580x653.png" alt="An ad tied to Verifone's petroleum services point-of-sale offerings." width="298" height="335" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/verifonefuel-580x653.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/verifonefuel.png 741w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-38321" class="wp-caption-text">An ad tied to Verifone&#8217;s petroleum services point-of-sale offerings.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;In January 2017, Verifone’s information security team saw evidence of a limited cyber intrusion into our corporate network,&#8221; Verifone spokesman <strong>Andy Payment</strong> said. &#8220;Our payment services network was not impacted. We immediately began work to determine the type of information targeted and executed appropriate measures in response. We believe today that due to our immediate response, the potential for misuse of information is limited.&#8221;</p>
<p>Verifone&#8217;s Mr. Payment declined to answer additional questions about the breach, such as how Verifone learned about it and whether the company was initially notified by an outside party. But a source with knowledge of the matter told KrebsOnSecurity.com that the employee alert Verifone sent out on Jan, 23, 2017 was in response to a notification that Verifone received from the credit card companies <strong>Visa</strong> and <strong>Mastercard</strong> just days earlier in January.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Visa declined to comment for this story. MasterCard officials did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>According to my source, the intrusion impacted at least one corner of Verifone&#8217;s business: A customer support <a href="http://www.verifone.com/products/hardware/petro-pos-systems/" target="_blank">unit based in Clearwater, Fla.</a> that provides comprehensive payment solutions specifically to gas and petrol stations throughout the United States &#8212; including, pay-at-the-pump credit card processing; physical cash registers inside the fuel station store; customer loyalty programs; and remote technical support.</p>
<p>The source said his employer shared with the card brands evidence that a Russian hacking group known for targeting payment providers and hospitality firms had compromised at least a portion of Verifone&#8217;s internal network.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote pqright">The source says Visa and MasterCard were notified that the intruders appeared to have been inside of Verifone&#8217;s network since mid-2016.</span> The source noted there is ample evidence the attackers used some of the same toolsets and infrastructure as the cybercrime gang that last year is thought to have <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/data-breach-at-oracles-micros-point-of-sale-division/" target="_blank">hacked into Oracle&#8217;s MICROS division</a>, a unit of Oracle that provides point-of-sale solutions to hundreds of thousands of retailers and hospitality firms.</p>
<p>Founded in Hawaii, U.S. in 1981, Verifone now operates in more than 150 countries worldwide and employ nearly 5,000 people globally.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 1:17 p.m. ET: </strong>Verifone circled back post-publication with the following update to their statement: &#8220;According to the forensic information to-date, the cyber attempt was limited to controllers at approximately two dozen gas stations, and occurred over a short time frame. We believe that no other merchants were targeted and the integrity of our networks and merchants’ payment terminals remain secure and fully operational.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Verifone commissioned an investigation of the breach from <a href="http://www.foregenix.com/" target="_blank">Foregenix Ltd.</a>, a digital forensics firm based in the United Kingdom that <a href="http://www.foregenix.com/partners" target="_blank">lists</a> Verifone as a &#8220;strategic partner.&#8221; Foregenix declined to comment for this story.</p>

												<p>Among today&#8217;s fastest-growing cybercrime epidemics is &#8220;ransomware,&#8221; malicious software that encrypts your computer files, photos, music and documents and then demands payment in Bitcoin to recover access to the files. A big reason for the steep increase in ransomware attacks in recent years comes from the proliferation of point-and-click tools sold in the cybercrime underground that make it stupid simple for anyone to begin extorting others for money.</p>
<p>Recently, I came across an extremely slick and professionally produced video advertisement promoting the features and usability of &#8220;Philadelphia,&#8221; a ransomware-as-a-service crimeware package that is sold for roughly $400 to would-be cybercriminals who dream of carving out their own ransomware empires.</p>
<p>This stunning advertisement does a thorough job of showcasing Philadelphia&#8217;s many features, including the ability to generate PDF reports and charts of victims &#8220;to track your malware campaigns&#8221; as well as the ability to plot victims around the world using Google Maps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything just works,&#8221; claim the proprietors of Philadelphia. &#8220;Get your lifetime copy. One payment. Free updates. No monthly fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>One interesting feature of this ransomware package is the ability to grant what the program&#8217;s architects call &#8220;mercy.&#8221; This refers to the desperate and heartbreaking pleas that ransomware purveyors often hear from impecunious victims whose infections have jeopardized some priceless and irreplaceable data &#8212; such as photos of long lost loved ones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll revisit the authors of this ransomware package in a future post. For now, just check out their ad. It&#8217;s fairly chilling.</p>

												<p>This blog has featured <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ingenico+and+skimmer&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">several stories</a> about &#8220;overlay&#8221; card and PIN skimmers made to be placed atop Ingenico-brand card readers at store self-checkout lanes. I&#8217;m revisiting the topic again because a security technician at a U.S.-based retailer recently shared a few photos of several of these devices pulled from compromised card terminals, and the images and his story offer a fair bit more detail than in previous articles.</p>
<div id="attachment_38241" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38241" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-38241" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ped3-Copy-580x431.jpg" alt="An &quot;overlay&quot; skimming device (right) that was found attached to a card reader at a retail establishment." width="580" height="431" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ped3-Copy-580x431.jpg 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ped3-Copy-768x570.jpg 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ped3-Copy-940x698.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-38241" class="wp-caption-text">An &#8220;overlay&#8221; skimming device (right) that was found attached to a card reader at a retail establishment.</p></div>
<p>The device featured here is a Bluetooth-based skimmer; it is designed to steal both the card data when a customer swipes and to record the victim&#8217;s PIN using a PIN pad overlay.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth component of the skimmer allows the thieves to retrieve stolen data wirelessly via virtually any Bluetooth enabled device &#8212; just by being in proximity to the compromised card terminal (~30 meters).</p>
<p>If we look on the backside of this skimmer, we can see the electronics needed to intercept the PIN. The source who shared these pictures said an employee thought the PIN pad buttons were a little too difficult to press down, and soon discovered this plastic overlay and others just like it on two more self-checkout terminals.</p>

												<p>In another strange tale from the kinetic-attack-meets-cyberattack department, earlier this week I heard from a loyal reader in Brazil whose wife was recently mugged by three robbers who nabbed her iPhone. Not long after the husband texted the stolen phone &#8212; offering to buy back the locked device &#8212; he soon began receiving text messages stating the phone had been found. All he had to do to begin the process of retrieving the device was click the texted link and log in to the phishing page mimicking Apple&#8217;s site.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38259" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/applephish.png" alt="applephish" width="578" height="311" /></p>
<p><strong>Edu Rabin </strong>is a resident of Porto Alegre, the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. Rabin said three thugs robbed his wife last Saturday in broad daylight. Thankfully, she was unharmed and all they wanted was her iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>Rabin said he then tried to locate the device using the &#8220;Find my iPhone&#8221; app.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was already in a nearby city, where the crime rates are even higher than mine,&#8221; Rabin said.</p>
<p>He said he then used his phone to send the robbers a message offering to buy back his wife&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’d sent a message with my phone number saying, &#8216;Dear mister robber, since you can’t really use the phone, I’m preparing to rebuy it from you. All my best!&#8217; This happened on Saturday. On Sunday, I’d checked again the search app and the phone was still offline and at same place.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the following day he began receiving text messages stating that his phone had been recovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Monday, I’d started to receive SMS messages saying that my iphone had been found and a URL to reach it,&#8221; Rabin said. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of one of those texts:</p>

<p>The link led to a page that looks exactly like the Brazilian version of Apple&#8217;s sign-in page, but which is hosted on a site that allows free Web hosting.</p>

												<p>Amid the hustle and bustle of the <strong>RSA Security Conference</strong> in San Francisco last week, researchers at RSA released a startling report that received very little press coverage relative to its overall importance. The report detailed a malware campaign that piggybacked on a popular piece of software used by system administrators at some of the nation&#8217;s largest companies. Incredibly, the report did not name the affected software, and the vendor in question has apparently chosen to bury its breach disclosure. This post is an attempt to remedy that.</p>
<p>The RSA report detailed the threat from a malware operation the company dubbed &#8220;<strong>Kingslayer</strong>.&#8221; According to RSA, the attackers compromised the Web site of a company that sells software to help Windows system administrators better parse and understand Windows event logs. RSA said the site hosting the event log management software was only compromised for two weeks &#8212; from April 9, 2015 to April 25, 2015 &#8212; but that the intrusion was likely far more severe than the short duration of the intrusion suggests.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because in addition to compromising the download page for this software package,<em> the attackers also hacked the company&#8217;s software update server</em>, <em>meaning any company that already had the software installed prior to the site compromise would likely have automatically downloaded the compromised version when the software regularly checked for available updates</em> (as it was designed to do).</p>
<div id="attachment_38174" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kingslayertimeline.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38174" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-38174 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kingslayertimeline-580x247.png" alt="Image: RSA" width="580" height="247" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kingslayertimeline-580x247.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kingslayertimeline-768x327.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kingslayertimeline.png 917w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-38174" class="wp-caption-text">Image: RSA</p></div>
<p>RSA said that in April 2016 it &#8220;sinkholed&#8221; or took control over the Web site that the malware used as a control server &#8212; <strong>oraclesoft[dot]net</strong> &#8212; and from there they were able to see indicators of which organizations might still be running the backdoored software. According to RSA, the victims included five major defense contractors; four major telecommunications providers; 10+ western military organizations; more than two dozen Fortune 500 companies; 24 banks and financial institutions; and at least 45 higher educational institutions.</p>
<p>RSA declined to name the software vendor whose site was compromised, but said the company issued a security notification on its Web site on June 30, 2016 and updated the notice on July 17, 2016 at RSA&#8217;s request following findings from further investigation into a defense contractor&#8217;s network. RSA also noted that the victim software firm had a domain name ending in &#8220;.net,&#8221; and that the product in question was installed as a Windows installer package file (.msi).</p>
<p>Using that information, it wasn&#8217;t super difficult to find the product in question. An Internet search for the terms &#8220;event log security notification april 2015&#8221; turns up <a href="http://www.eventid.net/evlog/evlogsecnote.asp" target="_blank">a breach notification</a> from June 30, 2016 about a software package called <strong>EVlog</strong>, produced by an <strong>Altair Technologies Ltd.</strong> in Mississauga, Ontario. The timeline mentioned in the breach notification exactly matches the timeline laid out in the RSA report.</p>
<p>As far as breach disclosures go, this one is about the lamest I&#8217;ve ever seen given the sheer number of companies that Altair Technologies <a href="http://www.eventid.net/whosubscribed.asp" target="_blank">lists on its site as subscribers to eventid.net</a>, an online service tied to EVlog. I could not locate a single link to this advisory anywhere on the company&#8217;s site, nor could I find evidence that Altair Technologies had made any effort via social media or elsewhere to call attention to the security advisory; it is simply buried in the site. A screenshot of the original, much shorter, version of that notice is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/evlogcomp.png" target="_blank">here</a>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/02/how-to-bury-a-major-breach-notification/#more-37888" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A handful of readers have inquired as to the whereabouts of <strong>Microsoft</strong>&#8216;s usual monthly patches for <strong>Windows</strong> and related software. Microsoft opted to delay releasing any updates until next month, even though there is a zero-day vulnerability in Windows going around. However, <strong>Adobe</strong> did push out updates this week as per usual to fix critical issues in its <strong>Flash Player</strong> software.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="brokenwindows" width="189" height="198" />In <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/02/14/february-2017-security-update-release/" target="_blank">a brief statement</a> this week, Microsoft said it &#8220;discovered a last minute issue that could impact some customers&#8221; that was not resolved in time for Patch Tuesday, which normally falls on the second Tuesday of each month. In an update to that advisory posted on Wednesday, Microsoft said it would deliver February&#8217;s batch of patches as part of the next regularly-scheduled Patch Tuesday, which falls on March 14, 2017.</p>
<p>On Feb. 2, the <strong>CERT Coordination Center</strong> at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/867968" target="_blank">warned</a> that an unpatched bug in a core file-sharing component of Windows (SMB) could let attackers crash Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 systems, as well as server equivalents of those platforms. CERT warned that exploit code for the flaw was already available online. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/02/february-updates-from-adobe-microsoft/#more-38156" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>It&#8217;s been a remarkable week for cyber justice. On Thursday, a Ukrainian man who hatched a plan in 2013 to send heroin to my home and then call the cops when the drugs arrived was sentenced to 41 months in prison for unrelated cybercrime charges. Separately, a 19-year-old American who admitted to being part of a hacker group that sent a heavily-armed police force to my home in 2013 was sentenced to three years probation.</p>

In a letter to this author following his arrest, Vovnenko said he forgave me for &#8220;doxing&#8221; him &#8212; printing his real name and image &#8212; on my site.</p></div>
<p><strong>Sergey Vovnenko</strong>, a.k.a. &#8220;Fly,&#8221; &#8220;Flycracker&#8221; and &#8220;MUXACC1,&#8221; pleaded guilty last year to aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors said Vovnenko operated a network of more than 13,000 hacked computers, using them to harvest credit card numbers and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>When I first became acquainted with Vovnenko in 2013, Fly was the administrator of the fraud forum “thecc[dot]bz,” an exclusive and closely guarded Russian language board dedicated to financial fraud and identity theft.</p>
<p>After I secretly gained access to his forum, I learned he’d hatched a plot to have heroin sent to my home and to have one of his forum lackeys call the police when the drugs arrived.</p>
<p>I explained this whole ordeal <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/10/hacker-who-sent-me-heroin-faces-charges-in-u-s/" target="_blank">in great detail in 2015</a>, when Vovnenko initially was extradited from Italy to face charges here in the United States. In short, the antics didn’t end when I foiled his plot to get me arrested for drug possession, and those antics likely contributed to his arrest and to this guilty plea.</p>
<p>Vovnenko contested his extradition from Italy, and in so doing spent roughly 15 months in arguably <a href="http://www.thelocal.it/20140615/italys-jailbirds-are-packed-like-sardines" target="_blank">Italy&#8217;s worst prison</a>. During that time, he seemed to have turned his life around, sending me postcards at Christmas time and even an apparently heartfelt apology letter.</p>
