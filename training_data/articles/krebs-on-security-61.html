												<p><strong>Equifax</strong> last week disclosed <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank">a historic breach</a> involving Social Security numbers and other sensitive data on as many as 143 million Americans. The company said the breach also impacted an undisclosed number of people in Canada and the United Kingdom. But the official list of victim countries may not yet be complete: According to information obtained by KrebsOnSecurity, Equifax can safely add Argentina &#8212; if not also other Latin American nations where it does business &#8212; to the list as well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equihax.png" alt="equihax" width="249" height="232" class="alignright size-full wp-image-40756" />Equifax is one of the world&#8217;s three-largest consumer credit reporting bureaus, and a big part of what it does is maintain records on consumers that businesses can use to learn how risky it might be to loan someone money or to extend them new lines of credit. On the flip side, Equifax is somewhat answerable to those consumers, who have a legal right to dispute any information in their credit report which may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>Earlier today, this author was contacted by <strong>Alex Holden</strong>, founder of Milwaukee, Wisc.-based <a href="https://holdsecurity.com" target="_blank">Hold Security LLC</a>. Holden&#8217;s team of nearly 30 employees includes two native Argentinians who spent some time examining Equifax&#8217;s South American operations online after the company disclosed the breach involving its business units in North America.</p>
<p>It took almost no time for them to discover that an online portal designed to let Equifax employees in Argentina manage credit report disputes from consumers in that country <em>was wide open, protected by perhaps the most easy-to-guess password combination ever: &#8220;admin/admin.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll speak about this Equifax Argentina employee portal &#8212; known as <strong>Veraz</strong> or &#8220;truthful&#8221; in Spanish &#8212; in the past tense because the credit bureau took the whole thing offline shortly after being contacted by KrebsOnSecurity this afternoon. The specific Veraz application being described in this post was dubbed <strong>Ayuda</strong> or &#8220;help&#8221; in Spanish on internal documentation.</p>
<div id="attachment_40715" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/admin.png"> <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40715" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39807 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/admin-580x119.png" alt=" " width="580" height="119" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-40715" class="wp-caption-text">The landing page for the internal administration page of Equifax&#8217;s Veraz portal. Click to enlarge.</p></div>
<p>Once inside the portal, the researchers found they could view the names of more than 100 Equifax employees in Argentina, as well as their employee ID and email address. The &#8220;list of users&#8221; page also featured a clickable button that anyone authenticated with the &#8220;admin/admin&#8221; username and password could use to add, modify or delete user accounts on the system. A search on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/622935/" target="_blank">&#8220;Equifax Veraz&#8221; at Linkedin</a> indicates the unit currently has approximately 111 employees in Argentina.</p>
<div id="attachment_40759" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifaxusers-red.png"> <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40759" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39807 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifaxusers-red-580x216.png" alt=" " width="580" height="216" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-40759" class="wp-caption-text">A partial list of active and inactive Equifax employees in Argentina. This page also let anyone add or remove users at will, or modify existing user accounts.</p></div>
<p>Each employee record included a company username in plain text, and a corresponding password that was obfuscated by a series of dots. </p>
<div id="attachment_40737" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/editusers-redacted.png"> <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40737" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39807 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/editusers-redacted-580x148.png" alt=" " width="580" height="148" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-40737" class="wp-caption-text">The &#8220;edit users&#8221; page obscured the Veraz employee&#8217;s password, but the same password was exposed by sloppy coding on the Web page.</p></div>
<p>However, all one needed to do in order to view said password was to right-click on the employee&#8217;s profile page and select &#8220;view source,&#8221; a function that displays the raw HTML code which makes up the Web site. Buried in that HTML code was the employee&#8217;s password in plain text.</p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>It remains unclear whether those responsible for stealing Social Security numbers and other data on as many as 143 million Americans from big-three credit bureau <strong>Equifax</strong> intend to sell this data to identity thieves. But if ever there was a reminder that you &#8212; the consumer &#8212; are ultimately responsible for protecting your financial future, this is it. Here&#8217;s what you need to know and what you should do in response to this unprecedented breach.</p>
<p>Some of the Q&amp;As below were originally published in a 2015 story, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/06/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-the-security-freeze/" target="_blank">How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the Security Freeze</a>. It has been updated to include new information specific to the Equifax intrusion.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What information was jeopardized in the breach?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Equifax was keen to point out that its investigation is ongoing. But for now, the data at risk includes Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses on 143 million Americans. Equifax also said the breach involved some driver&#8217;s license numbers (although it didn&#8217;t say how many or which states might be impacted), credit card numbers for roughly 209,000 U.S. consumers, and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Was the breach limited to Americans?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. Equifax said it believes the intruders got access to &#8220;limited personal information for certain UK and Canadian residents.&#8221; It has not disclosed what information for those residents was at risk or how many from Canada and the UK may be impacted.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is Equifax doing about this breach?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Equifax is offering one free year of their credit monitoring service. In addition, it has put up a Web site &#8212; <a href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/" target="_blank">www.equifaxsecurity2017.com</a> &#8212; that tried to let people determine whether they were affected.</p>
<p><strong>Q: That site tells me I was not affected by the breach. Am I safe?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> As noted in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank">this story from Friday</a>, the site seems hopelessly broken, often returning differing results for the same data submitted at different times. In the absence of more reliable information from Equifax, it is safer to assume you <strong>ARE</strong> compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I read that the legal language in the terms of service that consumers must accept before enrolling in the free credit monitoring service from Equifax requires one to waive their rights to sue the company in connection with this breach. Is that true?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Not according to Equifax. The company issued a statement over the weekend saying that nothing in that agreement applies to this cybersecurity incident.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So should I take advantage of the credit monitoring offer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It can&#8217;t hurt, but I wouldn&#8217;t count on it protecting you from identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Wait, what? I thought that was the whole point of a credit monitoring service?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The credit bureaus sure want you to believe that, but it&#8217;s not true in practice. These services do not prevent thieves from using your identity to open new lines of credit, and from damaging your good name for years to come in the process. The most you can hope for is that credit monitoring services will alert you soon after an ID thief <em>does</em> steal your identity.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Well then what the heck are these services good for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Credit monitoring services are principally useful in helping consumers recover from identity theft. Doing so often requires dozens of hours writing and mailing letters, and spending time on the phone contacting creditors and credit bureaus to straighten out the mess. In cases where identity theft leads to prosecution for crimes committed in your name by an ID thief, you may incur legal costs as well. Most of these services offer to reimburse you up to a certain amount for out-of-pocket expenses related to those efforts. But a better solution is to prevent thieves from stealing your identity in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s the best way to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> File a security freeze &#8212; also known as a credit freeze &#8212; with the four major credit bureaus.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is a security freeze?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A security freeze essentially blocks any potential creditors from being able to view or “pull” your credit file, unless you affirmatively unfreeze or thaw your file beforehand. With a freeze in place on your credit file, ID thieves can apply for credit in your name all they want, but they will not succeed in getting new lines of credit in your name because few if any creditors will extend that credit without first being able to gauge how risky it is to loan to you (i.e., view your credit file). And because each credit inquiry caused by a creditor has the potential to lower your credit score, the freeze also helps protect your score, which is what most lenders use to decide whether to grant you credit when you truly do want it and apply for it.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Q: What’s involved in freezing my credit file?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>A:</b> Freezing your credit involves notifying each of the major credit bureaus that you wish to place a freeze on your credit file. This can usually be done online, but in a few cases you may need to contact one or more credit bureaus by phone or in writing. Once you complete the application process, each bureau will provide a unique personal identification number (PIN) that you can use to unfreeze or “thaw” your credit file in the event that you need to apply for new lines of credit sometime in the future. Depending on your state of residence and your circumstances, you may also have to pay a small fee to place a freeze at each bureau. There are four consumer credit bureaus, including <a href="https://help.equifax.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/75/search/1" target="_blank">Equifax</a>, <a href="https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html" target="_blank">Experian</a>, <a href="https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze" target="_blank">Innovis</a> and <a href="http://www.transunion.com/securityfreeze" target="_blank">Trans Union</a>.  It&#8217;s a good idea to keep your unfreeze PIN(s) in a folder in a safe place (perhaps along with your latest credit report), so that when and if you need to undo the freeze, the process is simple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Q: How much is the fee, and how can I know whether I have to pay it?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>A: </b>The fee ranges from $0 to $15 per bureau, meaning that it can cost upwards of $60 to place a freeze at all four credit bureaus (recommended). However, in most states, consumers can freeze their credit file for free at each of the major credit bureaus if they also supply a copy of a police report and in some cases an affidavit stating that the filer believes he/she is or is likely to be the victim of identity theft. In many states, that police report can be filed and obtained online. The fee covers a freeze as long as the consumer keeps it in place. <strong>Consumers Union</strong> has <a href="http://consumersunion.org/research/consumers-unions-guide-to-security-freeze-protection-2/" target="_blank">a useful breakdown</a> of state-by-state fees.</span><span id="more-31191"></span> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-what-you-should-know/#more-40696" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>I cannot recall a previous data breach in which the breached company&#8217;s public outreach and response has been so haphazard and ill-conceived as the one coming right now from big-three credit bureau <strong>Equifax</strong>, which rather clumsily announced Thursday that an intrusion jeopardized Social security numbers and other information on 143 million Americans.</p>
<h4>WEB SITE WOES</h4>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-equifax-may-impact-143m-americans/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s breaking story</a> on this breach, the Web site that Equifax advertised as the place where concerned Americans could go to find out whether they were impacted by this breach &#8212; <a href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com" target="_blank">equifaxsecurity2017.com</a> &#8212;<br />
is completely broken at best, and little more than a stalling tactic or sham at worst.</p>
<p>In the early hours after the breach announcement, the site was being flagged by various browsers as a phishing threat. In some cases, people visiting the site were told they were not affected, only to find they received a different answer when they checked the site with the same information on their mobile phones.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/phonelaptopequifax-580x477.png" alt="phonelaptopequifax" width="580" height="477" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-40673" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/phonelaptopequifax-580x477.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/phonelaptopequifax-768x632.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/phonelaptopequifax.png 811w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>Others (myself included) received not a yes or no answer to the question of whether we were impacted, but instead a message that credit monitoring services we were eligible for were not available and to check back later in the month. The site asked users to enter their last name and last six digits of their SSN, but at the prompting of a reader&#8217;s comment I confirmed that just entering gibberish names and numbers produced the same result as the one I saw when I entered my real information: Come back on Sept. 13.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s responsible for this debacle? Well, Equifax of course. But most large companies that can afford to do so hire outside public relations or disaster response firms to walk them through the safest ways to notify affected consumers. In this case, Equifax appears to have hired global PR firm <strong>Edelman PR</strong>.</p>
<p>What gives me this idea? Until just a couple of hours ago, the copy of <strong>WordPress</strong> installed at equifaxsecurity2017.com included a publicly accessible user database entry showing a user named &#8220;Edelman&#8221; was the first (and only?) user registered on the site.</p>
<div id="attachment_40660" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifax-edelman.png"> <img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40660" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39807 size-medium" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifax-edelman-580x31.png" alt=" " width="580" height="31" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-40660" class="wp-caption-text">Code that was publicly available on equifaxsecurity2017.com until very recently showed account information for an outside PR firm.</p></div>
<p>I reached out to Edelman for more information and will update this story when I hear from them.</p>
<h4>EARLY WARNING?</h4>
<p>In its breach disclosure Thursday, Equifax said it hired an outside computer security forensic firm to investigate as soon as it discovered unauthorized access to its Web site. <strong>ZDNet</strong> published <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/security-firm-mandiant-said-to-be-helping-equifax-in-hack-aftermath/" target="_blank">a story</a> Thursday saying that the outside firm was Alexandria, Va.-based <strong>Mandiant</strong> &#8212; a security firm bought by <strong>FireEye</strong> in 2014.</p>
<p>Interestingly, anyone who happened to have been monitoring look-alike domains for Equifax.com prior to yesterday&#8217;s breach announcement may have had an early clue about the upcoming announcement. One interesting domain that was registered on Sept. 5, 2017 is &#8220;<strong>equihax.com</strong>,&#8221; which according to domain registration records was purchased by an Alexandria, Va. resident named <strong>Brandan Schondorfer</strong>.</p>
<p>A quick Google search shows that Schondorfer works for Mandiant. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rayjwatson" target="_blank">Ray Watson</a>, a cybersecurity researcher who messaged me this morning on Twitter about this curiosity, said it is likely that Mandiant has been registering domains that might be attractive to phishers hoping to take advantage of public attention to the breach and spoof Equifax&#8217;s domain.</p>
<p>Watson said it&#8217;s equally likely the equihax.com domain was registered to keep it out of the hands of people who may be looking for domain names they can use to lampoon Equifax for its breach. Schondorfer has not yet returned calls seeking comment. </p>
<h4>EQUIFAX EXECS PULL GOLDEN PARACHUTES?</h4>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-07/three-equifax-executives-sold-stock-before-revealing-cyber-hack" target="_blank">moved a story</a> yesterday indicating that three top executives at Equifax sold millions of dollars worth of stock during the time between when the company says it discovered the breach and when it notified the public and investors.</p>
<p>Shares of Equifax&#8217;s stock on the New York Stock Exchange [<a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:EFX" target="_blank">NSYE:EFX</a>] were down more than 13 percent at time of publication versus yesterday&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>The executives reportedly told Bloomberg they didn&#8217;t know about the breach when they sold their shares. A law firm in New York has already <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shareholder-alert---bronstein-gewirtz--grossman-llc-announces-investigation-of-equifax-inc-efx-300516058.html" target="_blank">announced</a> it is investigating potential insider trading claims against Equifax. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/#more-40658" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Equifax</strong>, one of the &#8220;big-three&#8221; U.S. credit bureaus, said today a data breach at the company may have affected 143 million Americans, jeopardizing consumer Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and some driver&#8217;s license numbers.</p>
<p>In a press release today, Equifax [<a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:EFX" target="_blank">NYSE:EFX</a>] said it discovered the &#8220;unauthorized access&#8221; on July 29, after which it hired an outside forensics firm to investigate. Equifax said the investigation is still ongoing, but that the breach also jeopardized credit card numbers for roughly 209,000 U.S. consumers and &#8220;certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers.&#8221;</p>
<div align="center"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bh1gzJFVFLc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition, the company said it identified unauthorized access to &#8220;limited personal information for certain UK and Canadian residents,&#8221; and that it would work with regulators in those countries to determine next steps.</p>
<p>“This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes,” said <strong>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</strong> <strong>Richard F. Smith</strong> in a statement released to the media, along with <a href="https://youtu.be/bh1gzJFVFLc" target="_blank">a video message</a>. “We pride ourselves on being a leader in managing and protecting data, and we are conducting a thorough review of our overall security operations.”</p>
<p>Equifax said the attackers were able to break into the company&#8217;s systems by exploiting an application vulnerability to gain access to certain files. It did not say which application or which vulnerability was the source of the breach.</p>
<p>Equifax has set up a Web site &#8212; <a href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com" target="_blank">https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com</a> &#8212; that anyone concerned can visit to see if they may be impacted by the breach. The site also lets consumers enroll in <strong>TrustedID Premier</strong>, a 3-bureau credit monitoring service (Equifax, Experian and Trans Union) which also is operated by Equifax.</p>
<p>According to Equifax, when you begin, you will be asked to provide your last name and the last six digits of your Social Security number. Based on that information, you will receive a message indicating whether your personal information may have been impacted by this incident. Regardless of whether your information may have been impacted, the company says it will provide everyone the option to enroll in <strong>TrustedID Premier</strong>. The offer ends Nov. 21, 2017.</p>
<h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>At time of publication, the Trustedid.com site Equifax is promoting for free credit monitoring services was only intermittently available, likely because of the high volume of traffic following today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>As many readers here have shared in the comments already, the site Equifax has available for people to see whether they were impacted by the breach may not actually tell you whether you were affected. When I entered the last six digits of my SSN and my last name, the site threw a &#8220;system unavailable&#8221; page, asking me to try again later.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40642" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifaxtry.png" alt="equifaxtry" width="501" height="202" /></p>
<p>When I tried again later, I received a notice stating my enrollment date for TrustedID Premier is Sept. 13, 2017, but it asked me to return again on or after that date to enroll. The message implied but didn&#8217;t say I was impacted.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40641" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/enrollmentequifax.png" alt="enrollmentequifax" width="374" height="258" /></p>
<p>Maybe Equifax simply isn&#8217;t ready to handle everyone in America asking for credit protection all at once, but this could be seen as a ploy by the company assuming that many people simply won&#8217;t return again after news of the breach slips off of the front page.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 11:40 p.m. ET:</strong> At a reader&#8217;s suggestion, I used a made-up last name and the last six digits of my Social Security number: The system returned the same response: Come back on Sept. 13. It&#8217;s difficult to tell if the site is just broken or if there is something more sinister going on here.</p>
<p>Also, perhaps because the site is so new and/or because there was a problem with one of the site&#8217;s SSL certificates, some browsers may be throwing a cert error when the site tries to load. This is the message that <a href="https://www.opendns.com" target="_blank">OpenDNS</a> users are seeing right now if they try to visit www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/opendns-equifax-580x599.png" alt="opendns-equifax" width="580" height="599" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-40652" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/opendns-equifax-580x599.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/opendns-equifax.png 719w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p><em>Original story:</em></p>
<p>Several readers who have taken my advice and placed <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=security+freeze&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">security freezes</a> (also called a credit freeze) on their file with Equifax have written in asking whether this intrusion means cybercriminals could also be in possession of the unique PIN code needed to lift the freeze.</p>
<p>So far, the answer seems to be &#8220;no.&#8221; Equifax was clear that its investigation is ongoing. However, in <a href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank">a FAQ</a> about the breach, Equifax said it has found no evidence to date of any unauthorized activity on the company&#8217;s core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-equifax-may-impact-143m-americans/#more-40626" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In early August 2017, <strong>FBI</strong> agents in Las Vegas arrested 23-year-old British security researcher <strong>Marcus Hutchins</strong> on suspicion of authoring and/or selling &#8220;<strong>Kronos</strong>,&#8221; a strain of malware designed to steal online banking credentials. Hutchins was virtually unknown to most in the security community until May 2017 when the U.K. media revealed him as the &#8220;accidental hero&#8221; who inadvertently halted the global spread of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=wannacry&#038;x=0&#038;y=0" target="_blank">WannaCry</a>, a ransomware contagion that had taken the world by storm just days before.</p>
<p>Relatively few knew it before his arrest, but Hutchins has for many years authored the popular cybersecurity blog <a href="https://www.malwaretech.com/" target="_blank">MalwareTech</a>. When this fact became more widely known &#8212; combined with his hero status for halting Wannacry &#8212; a great many MalwareTech readers quickly leapt to his defense to denounce his arrest. They reasoned that the government&#8217;s case was built on flimsy and scant evidence, noting that Hutchins has worked tirelessly to expose cybercriminals and their malicious tools. To date, some 226 supporters have <a href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/malwaretech/" target="_blank">donated more than $14,000</a> to his defense fund.</p>
<div id="attachment_40551" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40551" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-40551" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hutchins-580x289.png" alt="Marcus Hutchins, just after he was revealed as the security expert who stopped the WannaCry worm.

<p>At first, I did not believe the charges against Hutchins would hold up under scrutiny. But as I began to dig deeper into the history tied to dozens of hacker forum pseudonyms, email addresses and domains he apparently used over the past decade, a very different picture began to emerge.</p>
<p>In this post, I will attempt to describe and illustrate more than three weeks&#8217; worth of connecting the dots from what appear to be Hutchins&#8217; earliest hacker forum accounts to his real-life identity. The clues suggest that Hutchins began developing and selling malware in his mid-teens &#8212; only to later develop a change of heart and earnestly endeavor to leave that part of his life squarely in the rearview mirror.</p>
<h4>GH0STHOSTING/IARKEY</h4>
<p>I began this investigation with a simple search of domain name registration records at <strong>domaintools.com</strong> [full disclosure: Domain Tools recently was an advertiser on this site]. A search for &#8220;Marcus Hutchins&#8221; turned up a half dozen domains registered to a U.K. resident by the same name who supplied the email address &#8220;<strong>surfallday2day@hotmail.co.uk</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those domains &#8212; <strong>Gh0sthosting[dot]com</strong> (the third character in that domain is a zero) &#8212; corresponds to a hosting service that was advertised and sold circa 2009-2010 on <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=hackforums" target="_blank">Hackforums[dot]net</a>, a massively popular forum overrun with young, impressionable men who desperately wish to be elite coders or hackers (or at least recognized as such by their peers).</p>
<p>The surfallday2day@hotmail.co.uk address tied to Gh0sthosting&#8217;s initial domain registration records also was used to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iarkeyskpe.png" target="_blank">register a Skype account</a> named <strong>Iarkey</strong> that listed its alias as &#8220;Marcus.&#8221; A <a href="https://www.twitter.com/iarkey" target="_blank">Twitter account</a> registered in 2009 under the nickname &#8220;Iarkey&#8221; points to Gh0sthosting[dot]com.</p>
<p>Gh0sthosting was sold by a Hackforums user who used the same Iarkey nickname, and in 2009 Iarkey told fellow Hackforums users in a sales thread for his business that Gh0sthosting was &#8220;mainly for blackhats wanting to phish.&#8221; In a separate post just a few days apart from that sales thread, Iarkey <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/daloseronly15.png" target="_blank">responds that he is &#8220;only 15&#8221; years old</a>, and in another he confirms that his email address is surfallday2day@hotmail.co.uk.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40521" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/daloseronly15.png" alt="daloseronly15" width="512" height="266" /></p>
<p>A review of the historic reputation tied to the Gh0sthosting domain suggests that at least some customers took Iarkey up on his offer: <strong>Malwaredomainlist.com</strong>, for example, <a href="http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/mdl.php?inactive=on&amp;sort=IP&amp;search=dnsless.gh0sthosting.com&amp;colsearch=All&amp;ascordesc=DESC&amp;quantity=100&amp;page=0" target="_blank">shows</a> that around this same time in 2009 Gh0sthosting was observed hosting plenty of malware, including trojan horse programs, phishing pages and malware exploits.</p>
<p>A &#8220;reverse WHOIS&#8221; search at Domaintools.com shows that Iarkey&#8217;s surfallday2day email address was used initially to register several other domains, including <strong>uploadwith[dot]us</strong> and <strong>thecodebases[dot]com</strong>.</p>
<p>Shortly after registering Gh0sthosting and other domains tied to his surfallday2day@hotmail.co.uk address, Iarkey evidently thought better of including his real name and email address in his domain name registration records. Thecodebases[dot]com, for example, changed its WHOIS ownership to a &#8220;James Green&#8221; in the U.K., and switched the email to &#8220;<strong>herpderpderp2@hotmail.co.uk</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>A reverse WHOIS lookup at domaintools.com for that email address shows it was used to register a Hackforums parody (or phishing?) site called <strong>Heckforums[dot]net</strong>. The domain records showed this address was tied to a Hackforums clique called &#8220;<strong>Atthackers</strong>.&#8221; The records also listed a <strong>Michael Chanata</strong> from Florida as the owner. We&#8217;ll come back to Michael Chanata and Atthackers at the end of this post. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/who-is-marcus-hutchins/#more-40291" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>I awoke this morning to find my account on <strong>Twitter</strong> (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/briankrebs" target="_blank">@briankrebs</a>) had attracted almost 12,000 new followers overnight. Then I noticed I&#8217;d gained almost as many followers as the number of re-tweets (RTs) earned for <a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/902545914304319491" target="_blank">a tweet I published on Tuesday</a>. The tweet stated how every time I tweet something related to <strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin</strong> I get a predictable stream of replies that are in support of <strong>President Trump</strong> &#8212; even in cases when neither Trump nor the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign were mentioned.</p>
<div id="attachment_40479" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40479" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-40479" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/botcomment-580x619.png" alt="This tweet about Putin generated more than 12,000 retweets and likes in a few hours." width="580" height="619" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/botcomment-580x619.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/botcomment.png 668w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-40479" class="wp-caption-text">This tweet about Putin generated more than 12,000 retweets and likes in a few hours.</p></div>
<p>Upon further examination, it appears that almost all of my new followers were compliments of a social media botnet that is being used to amplify fake news and to intimidate journalists, activists and researchers. The botnet or botnets appear to be targeting people who are exposing the extent to which sock puppet and bot accounts on social media platforms can be used to influence public opinion.</p>
<p>After tweeting about my new bounty of suspicious-looking Twitter friends I learned from my legitimate followers on Twitter that @briankrebs wasn&#8217;t alone and that several journalists and nonprofit groups that have written recently about bot-like activity on Twitter experienced something similar over the past few days.</p>
<p>These tweet and follow storms seem capable of tripping some kind of mechanism at Twitter that seeks to detect when accounts are suspected of artificially beefing up their follower counts by purchasing followers (for more on that dodgy industry, check out <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/08/buying-battles-in-the-war-on-twitter-spam/" target="_blank">this post</a>).</p>
<p>Earlier today, <em>Daily Beast</em> cybersecurity reporter <strong>Joseph Cox</strong> <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/how-a-bot-army-probably-got-me-kicked-off-twitter" target="_blank">had his Twitter account suspended temporarily</a> after the account was the beneficiary of hundreds of bot followers over a brief period on Tuesday. This likely was the goal in the campaign against my site as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_40486" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40486" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-40486" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jcox-580x515.png" alt="Cox observed the same likely bot accounts that followed him following me and a short list of other users in the same order." width="580" height="515" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jcox-580x515.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jcox.png 721w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-40486" class="wp-caption-text">Cox observed the same likely bot accounts that followed him following me and a short list of other users in the same order.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Right after my Daily Beast story about suspicious activity by pro-Kremlin bots went live, my own account came under attack,&#8221; Cox wrote.</p>
<p>Let that sink in for a moment: A huge collection of botted accounts &#8212; the vast majority of which should be easily detectable as such &#8212; may be able to abuse Twitter&#8217;s anti-abuse tools to temporarily shutter the accounts of real people suspected of being bots!</p>
<p>Overnight between Aug. 28 and 29, a large Twitter botnet took aim at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/dfrlab" target="_blank">the account</a> for the <strong>Digital Forensic Research Lab</strong>, a project run by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Council" target="_blank">Atlantic Council</a>, a political think-tank based in Washington, D.C. In a post about the incident, DFRLab said the attack used fake accounts to impersonate and attack its members.</p>
<p>Those personal attacks &#8212; which included tweets and images lamenting the supposed death of DFR senior fellow <a href="https://www.twitter.com/benimmo" target="_blank">Ben Nimmo</a> &#8212; were then amplified and re-tweeted by tens of thousands of apparently automated accounts, according to <a href="https://medium.com/dfrlab/botspot-the-intimidators-135244bfe46b" target="_blank">a blost post</a> published today by DFRLab.</p>
<p>Suspecting that DFRLab was now being followed by many more botted accounts that might retweet or otherwise react to any further tweets mentioning bot attacks, Nimmo cleverly composed another tweet about the bot attack &#8212; only this time CC&#8217;ing the @Twitter and @Twittersupport accounts. Sure enough, that sly tweet was retweeted by bots more than 73,000 times before the tweet storm died down.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-40485" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tweetbotattack-580x284.png" alt="tweetbotattack" width="580" height="284" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tweetbotattack-580x284.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tweetbotattack.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We considered that the bots had probably been programmed to react to a relatively simple set of triggers, most likely the words &#8216;bot attack&#8217; and the @DFRLab handle,&#8221; Nimmo wrote. &#8220;To test the hypothesis, we posted a tweet mentioning the same words, and were retweeted over 500 times in nine minutes — something which, admittedly, does not occur regularly with our human followers.&#8221; Read more about the DFRLab episode <a href="https://medium.com/dfrlab/botspot-the-intimidators-135244bfe46b" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s Twitter bot drama follows similar attacks on public interest groups earlier this month. On Aug. 19, the award-winning investigative journalism site <strong>ProPublica.org</strong> published the story, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/leading-tech-companies-help-extremist-sites-monetize-hate/" target="_blank">Leading Tech Companies Help Extremist Sites Monetize Hate</a>.</p>
<p>On the morning of Tuesday, Aug. 22, several ProPublica reporters began receiving <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=email+flood&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">email bombs</a> &#8212; email list subscription attacks that can inundate a targeted inbox with dozens or even hundreds of email list subscription confirmation requests per minute. These attacks are designed to deluge the victim&#8217;s inbox with so many subscription confirmation requests that it becomes extremely time-consuming to fish out the legitimate messages amid the dross.</p>
<p>On Wednesday ProPublica author <strong>Jeff Larson</strong> saw <a href="https://twitter.com/thejefflarson/status/900089494027632641" target="_blank">a tweet he sent</a> about the email attacks get re-tweeted 1,200 times. Later that evening, senior reporting fellow <strong>Lauren Kirchner</strong> noticed a similar sized response to <a href="https://twitter.com/lkirchner/status/900338815965040641" target="_blank">her tweet</a> about how the subscription attack was affecting her ability to respond to messages.</p>
<p>On top of that, several ProPublica staffers suddenly gained about 500 new followers. On Thursday, ProPublica&#8217;s managing editor <strong>Eric Umansky</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/ericuman/status/900877797236891648" target="_blank">noticed</a> that a tweet accusing ProPublica of being an &#8220;alt-left #HateGroup and #FakeNews site funded by Soros&#8221; had received more than 23,000 re-tweets. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/twitter-bots-use-likes-rts-for-intimidation/#more-40470" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>U.S. federal agencies are warning citizens anxious to donate money for those victimized by Hurricane Harvey to be especially wary of scam artists. In years past we&#8217;ve seen shameless fraudsters stand up fake charities and other bogus relief efforts in a bid to capitalize on public concern over an ongoing disaster. Here are some tips to help ensure sure your aid dollars go directly to those most in need.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40460" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/charityscam.png" alt="charityscam" width="467" height="328" />The <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> (FTC) issued an alert Monday urging consumers to be on the lookout for a potential surge in charity scams. The FTC advises those who wish to donate to stick to charities they know, and to be on the lookout for charities or relief Web sites that seem to have sprung up overnight in response to current events (such as houstonfloodrelief.net, registered on Aug. 28, 2017). Sometimes these sites are set up by well-meaning people with the best of intentions (however misguided), but it&#8217;s best not to take a chance.</p>
<p>The FTC also warns consumers not to assume that a charity message posted on social media is a legitimate, and urges folks to research the organization before donating by visiting charity evaluation sites such as <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/" target="_blank">Charity Navigator</a>, <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/home" target="_blank">Charity Watch</a>, <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/" target="_blank">GuideStar</a>, or the <a href="http://give.org/" target="_blank">Better Business Bureau&#8217;s Wise Giving Alliance</a>. The agency also reminds people who wish to donate via text message to confirm the number with the source before you donate.</p>
<p>From the <strong>US Computer Emergency Readiness Team</strong> (US-CERT) comes a reminder that malware purveyors frequently use natural disasters and other breaking news items of broad interest to trick people into clicking on malicious links or opening booby-trapped email attachments.</p>
<p>If anyone spots additional recently-registered Harvey-themed relief domains, please drop a note in the comments below.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 11:42 p.m. ET:</strong> A reader pointed out a newly-registered domain &#8212; harveyfloodrelief[dot]org &#8212; that is currently requesting PayPal donations on behalf of Harvey victims.</p>

												<p>A half dozen technology and security companies &#8212; some of them competitors &#8212; issued the exact same press release today. This unusual level of cross-industry collaboration caps a successful effort to dismantle &#8216;<strong>WireX</strong>,&#8217; an extraordinary new crime machine comprising tens of thousands of hacked <strong>Android</strong> mobile devices that was used this month to launch a series of massive cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Experts involved in the takedown warn that WireX marks the emergence of a new class of attack tools that are more challenging to defend against and thus require broader industry cooperation to defeat.</p>
<div id="attachment_40436" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40436" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-40436" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wirexvolume-580x256.png" alt="This graphic shows the rapid growth of the WireX botnet in the first three weeks of August 2017." width="580" height="256" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wirexvolume-580x256.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wirexvolume-768x339.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wirexvolume.png 886w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-40436" class="wp-caption-text">This graphic shows the rapid growth of the WireX botnet in the first three weeks of August 2017.</p></div>
<p>News of WireX&#8217;s emergence first surfaced August 2, 2017, when a modest collection of hacked Android devices was first spotted conducting some fairly small online attacks. Less than two weeks later, however, the number of infected Android devices enslaved by WireX had ballooned to the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>More worrisome was that those in control of the botnet were now wielding it to take down several large websites in the hospitality industry &#8212; pelting the targeted sites with so much junk traffic that the sites were no longer able to accommodate legitimate visitors.</p>
<p>Experts tracking the attacks soon zeroed in on the malware that powers WireX: Approximately 300 different mobile apps scattered across <strong>Google</strong>&#8216;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=en" target="_blank">Play store</a> that were mimicking seemingly innocuous programs, including video players, ringtones or simple tools such as file managers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We identified approximately 300 apps associated with the issue, blocked them from the Play Store, and we’re in the process of removing them from all affected devices,&#8221; Google said in a written statement. &#8220;The researchers’ findings, combined with our own analysis, have enabled us to better protect Android users, everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps to avoid raising suspicion, the tainted Play store applications all performed their basic stated functions. But those apps also bundled a small program that would launch quietly in the background and cause the infected mobile device to surreptitiously connect to an Internet server used by the malware&#8217;s creators to control the entire network of hacked devices. From there, the infected mobile device would await commands from the control server regarding which Websites to attack and how.</p>
<div id="attachment_40437" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40437" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-40437" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wirexapps-580x344.png" alt="A sampling of the apps from Google's Play store that were tainted with the WireX malware." width="580" height="344" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wirexapps-580x344.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wirexapps.png 722w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-40437" class="wp-caption-text">A sampling of the apps from Google&#8217;s Play store that were tainted with the WireX malware.</p></div>
<p>Experts involved in the takedown say it&#8217;s not clear exactly how many Android devices may have been infected with WireX, in part because only a fraction of the overall infected systems were able to attack a target at any given time. Devices that were powered off would not attack, but those that were turned on with the device&#8217;s screen locked could still carry on attacks in the background, they found.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know in the cases where we pulled data out of our platform for the people being targeted we saw 130,000 to 160,000 (unique Internet addresses) involved in the attack,&#8221; said <strong>Chad Seaman</strong>, a senior engineer at <strong>Akamai</strong>, a company that specializes in helping firms weather large DDoS attacks (Akamai protected KrebsOnSecurity from hundreds of attacks prior to the large Mirai assault last year).</p>
<p>The identical press release that Akamai and other firms involved in the WireX takedown agreed to publish says the botnet infected a minimum of 70,000 Android systems, but Seaman says that figure is conservative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventy thousand was a safe bet because this botnet makes it so that if you&#8217;re driving down the highway and your phone is busy attacking some website, there&#8217;s a chance your device could show up in the attack logs with three or four or even five different Internet addresses,&#8221; Seaman said in an interview with KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;We saw attacks coming from infected devices in over 100 countries. It was coming from everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<h4>BUILDING ON MIRAI</h4>
<p>Security experts from Akamai and other companies that participated in the WireX takedown say the basis for their collaboration was forged in the monstrous and unprecedented distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks launched last year by <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=mirai&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">Mirai</a>, a malware strain that seeks out poorly-secured &#8220;Internet of things&#8221; (IoT) devices such as security cameras, digital video recorders and Internet routers.</p>
<p>The first and largest of the Mirai botnets was used in a giant attack last September that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" target="_blank">knocked this Web site offline for several days</a>. Just a few days after that &#8212; when the source code that powers Mirai was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank">published online</a> for all the world to see and use &#8212; dozens of copycat Mirai botnets emerged. Several of those botnets were used to conduct massive DDoS attacks against a variety of targets, leading to widespread Internet outages for many top Internet destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, director of security research at New York City-based security firm <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com" target="_blank">Flashpoint</a>, said the Mirai attacks were a wake-up call for the security industry and a rallying cry for more collaboration.</p>
<p>&#8220;When those really large Mirai DDoS botnets started showing up and taking down massive pieces of Internet infrastructure, that caused massive interruptions in service for people that normally don&#8217;t deal with DDoS attacks,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;It sparked a lot of collaboration. Different players in the industry started to take notice, and <span class="pullquote pqleft">a bunch of us realized that we needed to deal with this thing because if we didn&#8217;t it would just keep getting bigger and rampaging around</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mirai was notable not only for the unprecedented size of the attacks it could launch but also for its ability to spread rapidly to new machines. But for all its sheer firepower, Mirai is not a particularly sophisticated attack platform. Well, not in comparison to WireX, that is.</p>
<h4>CLICK-FRAUD ORIGINS</h4>
<p>According to the group&#8217;s research, the WireX botnet likely began its existence as a distributed method for conducting &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_fraud" target="_blank">click fraud</a>,&#8221; a pernicious form of online advertising fraud that will cost publishers and businesses an estimated $16 billion this year, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/15/businesses-could-lose-164-billion-to-online-advert-fraud-in-2017.html" target="_blank">recent estimates</a>. Multiple antivirus tools currently detect the WireX malware as a known click fraud malware variant.</p>
<p>The researchers believe that at some point the click-fraud botnet was repurposed to conduct DDoS attacks. While DDoS botnets powered by Android devices are extremely unusual (if not unprecedented at this scale), it is the botnet&#8217;s ability to generate what appears to be regular Internet traffic from mobile browsers that strikes fear in the heart of experts who specialize in defending companies from large-scale DDoS attacks. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/tech-firms-team-up-to-take-down-wirex-android-ddos-botnet/#more-40428" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>More online services than ever now offer two-step authentication &#8212; requiring customers to complete a login using their phone or other mobile device after supplying a username and password. But with so many services relying on your mobile for that second factor, there has never been more riding on the security of your mobile account. Below are some tips to ensure your mobile device (or, more specifically, your mobile carrier) isn&#8217;t the weakest link in your security chain.</p>
<p>For reasons explored more in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/the-value-of-a-hacked-email-account/" target="_blank">The Value of a Hacked Email Account</a>, many people become so preoccupied with securing online access to their financial accounts that they overlook or forget the fact that all of those precautions may be moot if hackers can access your email inbox. From that 2013 piece:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sign up with any service online, and it will almost certainly require you to supply an email address. In nearly all cases, the person who is in control of that address can reset the password of any associated services or accounts –merely by requesting a password reset email.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-40415" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/phonefraudsmaller-580x292.png" alt="phonefraudsmaller" width="580" height="292" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/phonefraudsmaller-580x292.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/phonefraudsmaller.png 609w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>Many webmail providers now encourage users to take advantage of two-step (a.k.a. &#8220;two factor&#8221;) authentication methods in addition to passwords for securing access to email. This usually involves the user adding a mobile phone number to their account that gets sent a one-time code that needs to be entered after supplying the account password. The idea here is that even if thieves somehow manage to phish or otherwise glean your account password, they still need access to your phone to discover the one-time code.</p>
<p>Depending on how you&#8217;ve set up two-step authentication, however, this may be far from airtight security. What&#8217;s more, not all two-step authentication methods are equally secure. Probably the most common form of secondary authentication &#8212; a one-time code sent to your mobile device via SMS/text message &#8212; is also the least secure. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/is-your-mobile-carrier-your-weakest-link/#more-40368" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>An October 2015 piece published here about the potential dangers of tossing out or posting online your airline boarding pass remains one of the most-read stories on this site. One reason may be that the advice remains timely and relevant: A talk recently given at a Czech security conference advances that research and offers several reminders of how being careless with your boarding pass could jeopardize your privacy or even cause trip disruptions down the road.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/10/whats-in-a-boarding-pass-barcode-a-lot/" target="_blank">What&#8217;s In a Boarding Pass Barcode? A Lot</a>, KrebsOnSecurity told the story of a reader whose friend posted a picture of a boarding pass on Facebook. The reader was able to use the airline&#8217;s Web site combined with data printed on the boarding pass to discover additional information about his friend. That data included details of future travel, the ability to alter or cancel upcoming flights, and a key component need to access the traveler&#8217;s frequent flyer account.</p>
<div id="attachment_40375" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40375" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-40375" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/instaboarding-580x548.png" alt="A search on Instagram for &quot;boarding pass&quot; returned 91,000+ results." width="580" height="548" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/instaboarding-580x548.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/instaboarding-768x725.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/instaboarding-940x887.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/instaboarding.png 948w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p id="caption-attachment-40375" class="wp-caption-text">A search on Instagram for &#8220;boarding pass&#8221; returned 91,000+ results.</p></div>
<p>More recently, security researcher <a href="https://www.michalspacek.com/" data-ss1503589564="1">Michal Špaček</a> gave a talk at a conference in the Czech Republic in which he explained how a few details gleaned from a picture of a friend&#8217;s boarding pass posted online give him the ability to view passport information on his friend via the airline&#8217;s Web site, and to change the password for another friend&#8217;s <strong>United Airlines</strong> frequent flyer account.</p>
<p>Working from a <strong>British Airways</strong> boarding pass that a friend posted to <strong>Instagram</strong>, Špaček found he could log in to the airline&#8217;s passenger reservations page using the six-digit <strong>booking code</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>PNR</strong> or <strong>p</strong>assenger <strong>n</strong>ame <strong>r</strong>ecord) and the last name of the passenger (both are displayed on the front of the BA boarding pass).</p>
<p>Once inside his friend&#8217;s account, Špaček saw he could cancel future flights, and view or edit his friend&#8217;s passport number, citizenship, expiration date and date of birth. In my 2015 story, I showed how this exact technique permitted access to the same information on <strong>Lufthansa</strong> customers (this still appears to be the case).</p>
<p>Špaček also reminds readers about the dangers of posting boarding pass barcodes or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank">QR codes</a> online, noting there are several barcode scanning apps and Web sites that can extract text data stored in bar codes and QR codes. Boarding pass bar codes and QR codes usually contain all of the data shown on the front of a boarding pass, and some boarding pass barcodes actually conceal even <em>more</em> personal information than what&#8217;s printed on the boarding pass.</p>
<p>As I noted back in 2015, <strong>United Airlines</strong> treats its customers’ frequent flyer numbers as secret access codes. For example, if you’re looking for your <strong>United Mileage Plus</strong> number, and you don’t have the original document or member card they mailed to you, good luck finding this information in your email correspondence with the company.</p>
<p>When United does include this code in correspondence, all but the last three characters are replaced with asterisks. The same is true with United’s boarding passes. However, the customer&#8217;s full Mileage Plus number is available if you take the time to decode the barcode on any United boarding pass.</p>
<p>Until very recently, if you knew the Mileage Plus number and last name of a United customer, you would have been able to reset their frequent flyer account password simply by guessing <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/united-airlines-sets-minimum-bar-on-security/" target="_blank">the multiple-choice answer to two secret questions</a> about the customer. However, United has since added a third step &#8212; requiring the customer to click a link in an email that gets generated when someone successfully guesses the multiple-choice answers to the two secret questions. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/why-its-still-a-bad-idea-to-post-or-trash-your-airline-boarding-pass/#more-40370" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
