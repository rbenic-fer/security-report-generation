												<p>A California man who pleaded guilty Tuesday to causing dozens of swatting attacks &#8212; including a deadly incident in Kansas last year &#8212; now faces 20 or more years in prison.</p>
<div id="attachment_42104" style="width: 268px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42104" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-42104" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tylerrajbarriss.png" alt="" width="258" height="344" /><p id="caption-attachment-42104" class="wp-caption-text">Tyler Raj Barriss, in an undated selfie.</p></div>
<p><strong>Tyler Barriss</strong>, 25, went by the nickname <strong>SWAuTistic</strong> on Twitter, and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/serial-swatter-swautistic-bragged-he-hit-100-schools-10-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveled in perpetrating &#8220;swatting&#8221; attacks</a>. These dangerous hoaxes involve making false claims to emergency responders about phony hostage situations or bomb threats, with the intention of prompting a heavily-armed police response to the location of the claimed incident.</p>
<p>On Dec. 28, 2017, Barriss placed a call from California to police in Wichita, Kansas, claiming that he was a local resident who&#8217;d just shot his father and was holding other family members hostage.</p>
<p>When Wichita officers responded to the address given by the caller &#8212; 1033 W. McCormick &#8212; they <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/kansas-man-killed-in-swatting-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot and killed</a> 28-year-old <strong>Andrew Finch</strong>, a father of two who had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Barriss admitted setting that fatal swatting attack in motion after getting in the middle of a dispute between two Call of Duty gamers, 18-year-old <strong>Casey Viner</strong> from Ohio and <strong>Shane Gaskill</strong>, 20, from Wichita.</p>
<p>Viner allegedly asked Barriss to swat Gaskill. But when Gaskill noticed Barriss&#8217; Twitter account (@swattingaccount) suddenly following him online, he tried to deflect the attack. Barriss says Gaskill allegedly dared him to go ahead with the swat, but then gave Barriss an old home address &#8212; 1033 W. McCormick &#8212; which was then being occupied by Finch&#8217;s family.</p>
<p>Viner and Gaskill are awaiting trial. A more detailed account of their alleged dispute <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/3-charged-in-fatal-kansas-swatting-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is told here</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>Justice Department</strong>, Barriss pleaded guilty to making hoax bomb threats in phone calls to the headquarters of the <strong>FBI</strong> and the <strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong> in Washington, D.C. He also made bomb threat and swatting calls from Los Angeles to emergency numbers in Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Massachusetts, Illinois, Utah, Virginia, Texas, Arizona, Missouri, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, Michigan, Florida and Canada.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney <strong>Stephen McAllister</strong> said Barriss faces 20 years or more in prison. Barriss is due to be sentenced Jan. 30, 2019.</p>
<p>Many readers following this story over the past year have commented here that the officer who fired the shot which killed Andrew Finch should also face prosecution. However, the district attorney for the county that encompasses Wichita decided in April that the officer <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article208738719.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not face charges</a>, and will not be named because he isn&#8217;t being charged with a crime. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/calif-man-pleads-guilty-in-fatal-swatting-case-faces-20-years-in-prison/#more-45700" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> on Tuesday released 16 software updates to fix more than 60 security holes in various flavors of <strong>Windows</strong> and other Microsoft products. <strong>Adobe</strong> also has security patches available for <strong>Flash Player</strong>, <strong>Acrobat</strong> and <strong>Reader</strong> users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="" width="229" height="240" />As per usual, most of the critical flaws &#8212; those that can be exploited by malware or miscreants without any help from users &#8212; reside in Microsoft&#8217;s Web browsers <strong>Edge</strong> and <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s patch batch addresses two flaws of particular urgency: One is a zero-day vulnerability (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8589</a>) that is already being exploited to compromise <strong>Windows 7</strong> and <strong>Server 2008</strong> systems.</p>
<p>The other is a publicly disclosed bug in Microsoft&#8217;s <strong>Bitlocker</strong> encryption technology (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8566</a>) that could allow an attacker to get access to encrypted data. One mitigating factor with both security holes is that the attacker would need to be already logged in to the targeted system to exploit them.</p>
<p>Of course, if the target has Adobe Reader or Acrobat installed, it might be easier for attackers to achieve that log in. According to <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2018/11/13/november-2018-patch-tuesday-62-vulns-tftp-server-rce-adobe-poc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> from security vendor <strong>Qualys</strong>, there is now code publicly available that could force these two products to leak a hash of the user&#8217;s Windows password (which could then be cracked with open-source tools). A <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb18-40.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new update</a> for Acrobat/Reader fixes this bug, and Adobe has published some <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/mitigation-NTLM-dictionary-attacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mitigation suggestions</a> as well. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/patch-tuesday-november-2018-edition/#more-45693" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

Lately, neglected domains have been getting scooped up by crooks who use them to set up fake e-commerce sites that steal credit card details from unwary shoppers.</p>
<p>For nearly 10 years, Portland, Ore. resident <strong>Julie Randall</strong> posted pictures for her photography business at <strong>julierandallphoto-dot-com</strong>, and used an email address at that domain to communicate with clients. The domain was on auto-renew for most of that time, but a change in her credit card details required her to update her records at the domain registrar &#8212; a task Randall says she now regrets putting off.</p>
<div id="attachment_45678" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jrp.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45678" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-45678" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jrp.png" alt="" width="597" height="276" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45678" class="wp-caption-text">Julierandallphoto-dot-com is now one of hundreds of fake ecommerce sites set up to steal credit card details.</p></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because in June of this year the domain expired, and control over her site went to someone who purchased it soon after. Randall said she didn&#8217;t notice at the time because she was in the middle of switching careers, didn&#8217;t have any active photography clients, and had gotten out of the habit of checking that email account.</p>
<p>Randall said she only realized she&#8217;d lost her domain after failing repeatedly to log in to her <strong>Instagram</strong> account, which was registered to an email address at julierandallphoto-dot-com.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I tried to reset the account password through Instagram&#8217;s procedure, I could see that the email address on the account had been changed to a .ru email,&#8221; Randall told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;I still don&#8217;t have access to it because I don&#8217;t have access to the email account tied to my old domain. It feels a little bit like the last ten years of my life have kind of been taken away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visit julierandallphoto.com today and you&#8217;ll see a Spanish language site selling <strong>Reebok</strong> shoes (screenshot above). The site certainly looks like a real e-commerce shop; it has plenty of product pages and images, and of course a shopping cart. But the site is noticeably devoid of any SSL certificate (the entire site is http://, not https://), and the products for sale are all advertised for roughly half their normal cost.</p>
<p>A review of the neighboring domains that reside at Internet addresses adjacent to julierandallphoto-dot-com (<strong>196.196.152/153.x</strong>, etc.) shows hundreds of other domains that were apparently registered upon expiration over the past few months and which now feature similar http-only online shops in various languages pimping low-priced, name brand shoes and other clothing.</p>
<p>Until earlier this year, <strong>wildcatgroomers-dot-com</strong> belonged to a company in Wisconsin that sold equipment for grooming snowmobile trails. It&#8217;s now advertising running shoes. Likewise, <strong>kavanaghsirishpub-dot-com</strong> corresponded to a pub and restaurant in Tennessee until mid-2018; now it&#8217;s pretending to sell cheap <strong>Nike</strong> shoes.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going here?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/inside-magecart-exposes-operation-behind-webs-biggest-ecommerce-scourge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an in-depth report</a> jointly released today by security firms <strong>Flashpoint</strong> and <strong>RiskIQ</strong>, the sites are almost certainly set up simply to siphon payment card data from unwary shoppers looking for specific designer footwear and other clothing at bargain basement prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have observed more than 800 sites hosting these brand impersonation/skimming stores since June 2018,&#8221; the report notes.</p>

												<p>A Connecticut man who&#8217;s earned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug bounty</a> rewards and public recognition from top telecom companies for finding and reporting security holes in their Web sites secretly operated a service that leveraged these same flaws to sell their customers&#8217; personal data, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<p>In May 2018, <em>ZDNet</em> ran <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tmobile-bug-let-anyone-see-any-customers-account-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a story</a> about the discovery of a glaring vulnerability in the Web site for wireless provider <strong>T-Mobile</strong> that let anyone look up customer home addresses and account PINs. The story noted that T-Mobile disabled the feature in early April after being alerted by a 22-year-old &#8220;security researcher&#8221; named <strong>Ryan Stevenson</strong>, and that the mobile giant had awarded Stevenson $1,000 for reporting the discovery under its bug bounty program.</p>
<div id="attachment_45654" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/phobiatwitter.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45654" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-45654" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/phobiatwitter.png" alt="" width="594" height="254" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45654" class="wp-caption-text">The Twitter account @phobia, a.k.a. Ryan Stevenson. The term &#8220;plug&#8221; referenced next to his Twitch profile name is hacker slang for employees at mobile phone stores who can be tricked or bribed into helping with SIM swap attacks.</p></div>
<p>Likewise, AT&amp;T has <a href="https://bugbounty.att.com/hof.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recognized</a> Stevenson for reporting security holes in its services. AT&amp;T&#8217;s bug bounty site lets contributors share a social media account or Web address where they can be contacted, and in Stevenson&#8217;s case he gave the now-defunct Twitter handle &#8220;@Phoobia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stevenson&#8217;s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ryan-phobias-li.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linkedin profile</a> &#8212; named &#8220;Phobias&#8221; &#8212; says he specializes in finding exploits in numerous Web sites, including hotmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, paypal.com and ebay.com. Under the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ryan-LI-contacts.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;contact info&#8221; tab</a> of Stevenson&#8217;s profile it lists the youtube.com account of &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/ryan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan</a>&#8221; and the Facebook account &#8220;Phobia&#8221; (also now deleted).</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I came across multiple variations on this Phobia nickname as I was researching <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/busting-sim-swappers-and-sim-swap-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a story published this week</a> on the <a href="https://twitter.com/CoolItsConvict/status/1046210233390039040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">epidemic of fraudulent SIM swaps</a>, a complex form of mobile phone fraud that is being used to steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Unauthorized SIM swaps also are often used to hijack so-called <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/talktalk-script-kids-the-quest-for-og/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;OG&#8221; user accounts</a> &#8212; usually short usernames on top social network and gaming Web sites that are highly prized by many hackers because they can make the account holder appear to have been a savvy, early adopter of the service before it became popular and before all of the short usernames were taken. Some OG usernames can be sold for thousands of dollars in underground markets.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/busting-sim-swappers-and-sim-swap-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIM swapping story</a> quoted one recent victim who lost $100,000 after his mobile phone number was briefly stolen in a fraudulent SIM swap. The victim said he was told by investigators in Santa Clara, Calif. that the perpetrators of his attack were able to access his T-Mobile account information using a specialized piece of software that gave them backdoor access to T-Mobile&#8217;s customer database.</p>
<p>Both the Santa Clara investigators and T-Mobile declined to confirm or deny the existence of this software. But their non-denials prompted me to start looking for it on my own. So naturally I began searching at <strong>ogusers-dot-com</strong>, a forum dedicated to the hacking, trading and sale of OG accounts. Unsurprisingly, ogusers-dot-com also has traditionally been the main stomping grounds for many individuals involved in SIM swapping attacks.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long to discover an account on ogusers named &#8220;Ryan,&#8221; who for much of 2018 has advertised a number of different &#8220;doxing&#8221; services &#8212; specifically those aimed at finding the personal information of customers at major broadband and telecom companies. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/bug-bounty-hunter-ran-isp-doxing-service/#more-45569" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A year ago, KrebsOnSecurity warned that &#8220;Informed Delivery,&#8221; a new offering from the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> (USPS) that lets residents view scanned images of all incoming mail, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was likely to be abused by identity thieves and other fraudsters</a> unless the USPS beefed up security around the program and made it easier for people to opt out. This week, the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> issued an internal alert warning that many of its field offices have reported crooks are indeed using Informed Delivery to commit various identity theft and credit card fraud schemes.</p>
<div id="attachment_45608" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45608" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45608" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/idusps.png" alt="" width="595" height="228" /><p id="caption-attachment-45608" class="wp-caption-text">Image: USPS</p></div>
<p>The internal alert &#8212; sent by the Secret Service on Nov. 6 to its law enforcement partners nationwide &#8212; references a recent case in Michigan in which seven people were arrested for allegedly stealing credit cards from resident mailboxes after signing up as those victims at the USPS&#8217;s Web site.</p>
<p>According to the Secret Service alert, the accused used the Informed Delivery feature &#8220;to identify and intercept mail, and to further their identity theft fraud schemes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fraudsters were also observed on criminal forums discussing using the Informed Delivery service to surveil potential identity theft victims,&#8221; the Secret Service memo reads.</p>
<p>The USPS did not respond to repeated requests for comment over the past six days.</p>
<p>The Michigan incident in the Secret Service alert refers to <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/09/mail_theft_leads_to_400k_in_cr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the September 2018 arrest of seven people</a> accused of running up nearly $400,000 in unauthorized charges on credit cards they ordered in the names of residents. According to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rolle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a copy of the complaint in that case</a> (PDF), the defendants allegedly stole the new cards out of resident mailboxes, and then used them to fraudulently purchase gift cards and merchandise from department stores.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity took the USPS to task last year in part for not using its own unique communications method &#8212; the U.S. Mail &#8212; to validate and notify residents when someone at their address signs up for Informed Delivery. The USPS <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/usps-finally-starts-notifying-you-by-mail-if-someone-is-scanning-your-snail-mail-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed that shortcoming earlier this year</a>, announcing it had started alerting all households by mail whenever anyone signs up to receive scanned notifications of mail delivered to their address.</p>
<p>However, it appears that ID thieves have figured out ways to hijack identities and order new credit cards in victims&#8217; names before the USPS can send their notification &#8212; possibly by waiting until the cards are already approved and ordered before signing up for Informed Delivery in the victim&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Last month, WKMG&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/09/mail_theft_leads_to_400k_in_cr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickorlando.com wrote</a> that a number of Belle Isle, Fla. residents reported receiving hefty bills for credit cards they never knew they had. One resident was quoted as saying she received a bill for $2,000 in charges on a card she&#8217;d never seen before, and only after that did she get a notice from the USPS saying someone at her address had signed up for Informed Delivery. The only problem was she&#8217;d never signed up for the USPS program.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to a police report, someone opened fraudulent credit card accounts and charged more than $14,000 and signed her neighbors up for Informed Delivery, too,&#8221; Clickorlando&#8217;s <strong>Louis Bolden</strong> explained. &#8220;Photos of what would be in their mail were going to someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residents in Texas have reported similar experiences. <strong>Dave Lieber</strong>, author of <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/watchdog/2018/11/02/identity-thieves-can-use-post-office-service-hijack-mail-steal-identity-can" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Watchdog column</a> for <em>The Dallas Morning News</em>, said he heard from victim <strong>Chris Torraca</strong>, 58, a retired federal bank regulator from Grapevine, a town between Dallas and Ft. Worth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chris discovered it after someone created an account in his name at usps.com,&#8221; Lieber wrote in a post published Nov. 2. &#8220;The thief began receiving photos of Chris&#8217; mail and also opened a bank credit card in Chris&#8217; wife&#8217;s name. Postal officials promote the program as a great way to prevent ID theft, but for Chris, that&#8217;s what led to it.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/u-s-secret-service-warns-id-thieves-are-abusing-uspss-mail-scanning-service/#more-45519" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>KrebsOnSecurity recently had a chance to interview members of the <strong>REACT Task Force</strong>, a team of law enforcement officers and prosecutors based in Santa Clara, Calif. that has been tracking down individuals engaged in unauthorized &#8220;SIM swaps&#8221; &#8212; a complex form of mobile phone fraud that is often used to steal large amounts of cryptocurrencies and other items of value from victims. Snippets from that fascinating conversation are recounted below, and punctuated by accounts from a recent victim who lost more than $100,000 after his mobile phone number was hijacked.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-44711" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/newsnip.png" alt="" width="358" height="501" /></p>
<p>In late September 2018, the REACT Task Force spearheaded an investigation that led to the <a href="https://kfor.com/2018/09/28/2-men-arrested-in-oklahoma-suspected-in-14-million-cryptocurrency-theft-hacking-of-california-company/amp/?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrest of two Missouri men</a> &#8212; both in their early 20s &#8212; who are accused of conducting SIM swaps to steal $14 million from a cryptocurrency company based in San Jose, Calif. Two months earlier, the task force was instrumental in <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/03/sim-swap-cryptocurrency-busts-highlight-new-frontier-for-bay-area-tech-cops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apprehending 20-year-old Joel Ortiz</a>, a Boston man suspected of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/08/alleged-sim-swapper-arrested-in-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stealing millions of dollars in cryptocoins</a> with the help of SIM swaps.</p>
<p><strong>Samy Tarazi</strong> is a sergeant with the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#8217;s office and a REACT supervisor. The force was originally created to tackle a range of cybercrimes, but Tarazi says SIM swappers are a primary target now for two reasons. First, many of the individuals targeted by SIM swappers live in or run businesses based in northern California.</p>
<p>More importantly, he says, the frequency of SIM swapping attacks is&#8230;well, off the hook right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably REACT&#8217;s highest priority at the moment, given that SIM swapping is actively happening to someone probably even as we speak right now,&#8221; Tarazi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also because there are a lot of victims in our immediate jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>As common as SIM swapping has become, Tarazi said he and other members of REACT suspect that there are only a few dozen individuals responsible for perpetrating most of these heists.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the amounts being stolen and the number of people being successful at taking it, the numbers are probably historic,&#8221; Tarazi said. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking about kids aged mainly between 19 and 22 being able to steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies. I mean, if someone gets robbed of $100,000 that&#8217;s a huge case, but <span class="pullquote pqleft">we&#8217;re now dealing with someone who buys a 99 cent SIM card off eBay, plugs it into a cheap burner phone, makes a call and steals millions of dollars. That&#8217;s pretty remarkable.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the theft of $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency in July 2018 was the impetus for my interview with REACT. I reached out to the task force after hearing about their role in assisting SIM swapping victim <strong>Christian Ferri</strong>, who is president and CEO of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency firm <a href="https://www.block-star.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockStar</a>.</p>
<p>In early July 2018, Ferri was traveling in Europe when he discovered his <strong>T-Mobile</strong> phone no longer had service. He&#8217;d later learn that thieves had abused access to T-Mobile&#8217;s customer database to deactivate the SIM card in his phone and to activate a new one that they had in their own mobile device.</p>
<p>Soon after, the attackers were able to use their control over his mobile number to reset his <strong>Gmail</strong> account password. From there, the perpetrators accessed a <strong>Google Drive</strong> document that Ferri had used to record credentials to other sites, including a cryptocurrency exchange. Although that level of access could have let the crooks steal a great deal more from Ferri, they were simply after his cryptocoins, and in short order he was relieved of approximately $100,000 worth of coinage.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear more about Ferri&#8217;s case in a moment. But first I should clarify that the REACT task force members did not discuss with me the details of Mr. Ferri&#8217;s case &#8212; even though according to Ferri a key member of the task force we&#8217;ll meet later has been actively investigating on his behalf. The remainder of this interview with REACT pivots off of Ferri&#8217;s incident mainly because the details surrounding his case help clarify some of the most confusing and murky aspects of how these crimes are perpetrated &#8212; and, more importantly, what we can do about them.</p>
<h4>WHO&#8217;S THE TARGET?</h4>
<p>SIM swapping attacks primarily target individuals who are visibly active in the cryptocurrency space. This includes people who run or work at cryptocurrency-focused companies; those who participate as speakers at public conferences centered around Blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies; and those who like to talk openly on social media about their crypto investments.</p>
<p>REACT Lieutenant <strong>John Rose</strong> said in addition to or in lieu of stealing cryptocurrency, some SIM swappers will relieve victims of highly prized social media account names (also known as &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/talktalk-script-kids-the-quest-for-og/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OG accounts</a>&#8220;) &#8212; usually short usernames that can convey an aura of prestige or the illusion of an early adopter on a given social network. OG accounts typically can be resold for thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Rose said even though a successful SIM swap often gives the perpetrator access to traditional bank accounts, the attackers seem to be mainly interested in stealing cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many SIM swap victims are understandably very scared at how much of their personal information has been exposed when these attacks occur,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;But [the attackers] are predominantly interested in targeting cryptocurrencies for the ease with which these funds can be laundered through online exchanges, and because the transactions can&#8217;t be reversed.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45224" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/phonescam.png" alt="" width="593" height="374" /></p>
<h4>FAKE IDs AND PHONY NOTES</h4>
<p>The &#8220;how&#8221; of these SIM swaps is often the most interesting because it&#8217;s the one aspect of this crime that&#8217;s probably the least well-understood. Ferri said when he initially contacted T-Mobile about his incident, the company told him that the perpetrator had entered a T-Mobile store and presented a fake ID in Ferri&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>But Ferri said once the REACT Task Force got involved in his case, it became clear that video surveillance footage from the date and time of his SIM swap showed no such evidence of anyone entering the store to present a fake ID. Rather, he said, this explanation of events was a misunderstanding at best, and more likely a cover-up at some level.</p>
<p><strong>Caleb Tuttle</strong>, a detective with the Santa Clara County District Attorney&#8217;s office, said he has yet to encounter a single SIM swapping incident in which the perpetrator actually presented ID in person at a mobile phone store. That&#8217;s just too risky for the attackers, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve talked to hundreds of victims, and I haven&#8217;t seen <em>any cases</em> where the suspect is going into a store to do this,&#8221; Tuttle said.</p>
<p>Tuttle said SIM swapping happens in one of three ways. The first is when the attacker bribes or blackmails a mobile store employee into assisting in the crime. The second involves current and/or former mobile store employees who knowingly abuse their access to customer data and the mobile company&#8217;s network. Finally, crooked store employees may trick unwitting associates at other stores into swapping a target&#8217;s existing SIM card with a new one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of these SIM swaps are being done over the phone, and the notes we&#8217;re seeing about the change in the [victim&#8217;s] account usually are left either by [a complicit] employee trying to cover their tracks, or because the employee who typed in that note actually believed what they were typing.&#8221; In the latter case, the employee who left a note in the customer&#8217;s account saying ID had been presented in-store was tricked by a complicit co-worker at another store who falsely claimed that a customer there had already presented ID.</p>
<h4>DARK WEB SOFTWARE?</h4>
<p>Ferri said the detectives investigating his SIM swap attack let on that the crooks responsible had at some point in the attack used &#8220;specialized software to get into T-Mobile&#8217;s customer database.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigator said there were employees of the company who had built a special software tool that they could use to connect to T-Mobile&#8217;s customer database, and that they could use this software from their home or couch to log in and see all the customer information there,&#8221; Ferri recalled. &#8220;The investigator didn&#8217;t explain exactly how it worked, but it was basically a backdoor entrance that they were reselling on the Dark Web, and it bypassed whatever security there was and let them go straight into the customer database.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked directly about this mysterious product supposedly being offered on the Dark Web, the REACT task force members put our phone interview on hold for several minutes while they privately huddled to discuss the question. When they finally took me off mute, a member of the task force instead answered a different question that I&#8217;d asked much earlier in the interview.</p>
<p>When pressed about the software again, there was a long, uncomfortable silence. Then Detective Tuttle spoke up.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote pqright">&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to talk about that,&#8221; he said curtly. &#8220;Deal with it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>T-Mobile likewise declined to comment on the allegation that thieves had somehow built software which gave them direct access to T-Mobile customer data. However, in at least three separate instances over the past six months, T-Mobile has been forced to acknowledge incidents of unauthorized access to customer records.</p>
<p>In August 2018, T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/customers/6305378821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a notice</a> saying its security team discovered and shut down unauthorized access to certain information, including customer name, billing zip code, phone number, email address, account number, account type (prepaid or postpaid) and/or date of birth. A T-Mobile spokesperson said at the time that this incident impacted roughly two percent of its subscriber base, or approximately 2.5 million customers.</p>
<p>In May 2018, T-Mobile <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tmobile-bug-let-anyone-see-any-customers-account-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixed a bug in its Web site</a> that let anyone view the personal account details of any customer. The bug could be exploited simply by adding the phone number of a target to the end of a Web address used by one of the company&#8217;s internal tools that was nevertheless accessible via the open Internet. The data provided by that tool reportedly also included references to account PINs used by customers as a security question when contacting T-Mobile customer support.</p>
<p>In April 2018, T-Mobile <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjx3e4/t-mobile-website-allowed-hackers-to-access-your-account-data-with-just-your-phone-number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixed a related bug</a> in its public Web site that allowed anyone to pull data tied to customer accounts, including the user&#8217;s account number and the target phone&#8217;s IMSI &#8212; a unique number that ties subscribers to their specific mobile device. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/busting-sim-swappers-and-sim-swap-myths/#more-45521" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Crooks who hack online merchants to steal payment card data are constantly coming up with crafty ways to hide their malicious code on Web sites. In Internet ages past, this often meant obfuscating it as giant blobs of gibberish text that was obvious even to the untrained eye. These days, a compromised e-commerce site is more likely to be seeded with a tiny snippet of code that invokes a hostile domain which appears harmless or that is virtually indistinguishable from the hacked site&#8217;s own domain.</p>
<p>Before going further, I should note that this post includes references to domains that are either compromised or actively stealing user data. Although the malcode implanted on these sites is not designed to foist malicious software on visitors, please be aware that this could change at a moment&#8217;s notice. Anyone seeking to view the raw code on sites referenced here should proceed with caution; using an online source code viewer <a href="https://htmlstrip.com/html-source-code-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like this one</a> can let readers safely view the HTML code on any Web page without actually rendering it in a Web browser.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>asianfoodgrocer-dot-com</strong> offers a range of comestibles. It also currently includes a spicy bit of card-skimming code that is hosted on the domain <strong>zoobashop-dot-com</strong>. In this case, it is easy to miss the malicious code when reviewing the HTML source, as it fits neatly into a single, brief line of code.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/zooba.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45534" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/zooba.png" alt="" width="592" height="127" /></a></p>
<p>Zoobashop is also a presently hacked e-commerce site. Based in Accra, Ghana, zoobashop bills itself as Ghana&#8217;s &#8220;largest online store.&#8221; In addition to offering great deals on a range of electronics and home appliances, it is currently serving a tiny obfuscated script called &#8220;js.js&#8221; that snarfs data submitted into online forms.</p>
<p>As sneaky as this attack may be, the hackers in this case did not go out of their way to make the domain hosting the malicious script blend in with the surrounding code. However, increasingly these data-slurping scripts are hidden behind fully fraudulent https:// domains that are custom-made to look like they might be associated with content delivery networks (CDNs) or web-based scripts, and include terms like &#8220;jquery,&#8221; &#8220;bootstrap,&#8221; and &#8220;js.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.publicwww.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publicwww.com</a> is a handy online service that lets you search the Web for sites running snippets of specific code. Searching publicwww.com for sites <a href="https://publicwww.com/websites/%22bootstrap-js.com%22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulling code from bootstrap-js-dot-com</a> currently reveals more than 50 e-commerce sites seeded with this malicious script. A search at publicwww for the <a href="https://publicwww.com/websites/%22js-react.com%22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malcode hosted at js-react-dot-com</a> indicates the presence of this code on at least a dozen online merchants.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the malicious domain created to host a data-snarfing script mimics the host domain by referencing a doppelganger Web site name. For example, check out the source code for the e-commerce site <strong>bargainjunkie-dot-com</strong> and you&#8217;ll notice at the bottom that it pulls a malicious script from the domain &#8220;<strong>bargalnjunkie-dot-com</strong>,&#8221; where the &#8220;i&#8221; in &#8220;bargain&#8221; is sneakily replaced with a lowercase &#8220;L&#8221;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45537" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bargal.png" alt="" width="591" height="114" /></p>
<p>In many cases, running a reverse search for other domain names where the doppelganger domain is hosted reveals additional compromised hosts, or other methods of compromising them. For example, the look-alike domain bargalnjunkie-dot-com is hosted on the address 46.161.40.49, which is the home to several domains, including <strong>payselector-dot-com</strong> and <strong>billgetstatus-dot-com</strong>.</p>
<p>Payselector-dot-com and billgetstatus-dot-com were apparently registered so that they appear related to online payment services. But both of these domains actually host complex malicious scripts that are loaded in an obfuscated way on a number of Web sites &#8212; including the ballet enthusiast store <strong>balletbeautiful-dot-com</strong>. Interestingly, the Internet address hosting the payselector and billgetstatus domains &#8212; the aforementioned 46.161.40.49 &#8212; also hosts the doppelganger domain &#8220;balletbeautlful-dot-com,&#8221; again with the &#8220;i&#8221; replaced by a lowercase &#8220;L&#8221;. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/whos-in-your-online-shopping-cart/#more-45523" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Thieves are combining SMS-based phishing attacks with new &#8220;cardless&#8221; ATMs to rapidly convert phished bank account credentials into cash. Recent arrests in Ohio shed light on how this scam works.</p>
<p>A number of financial institutions are now offering cardless ATM transactions that allow customers to withdraw cash using nothing more than their mobile phones. But this also creates an avenue of fraud for bad guys, who can leverage phished or stolen account credentials to add a new phone number to the customer&#8217;s account and then use that added device to siphon cash from hijacked accounts at cardless ATMs.</p>
<div id="attachment_45511" style="width: 602px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45511" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45511" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cardlessatm.png" alt="" width="592" height="226" /><p id="caption-attachment-45511" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Mastercard.us</p></div>
<p>In May 2018, Cincinnati, Ohio-based financial institution <a href="https://www.53.com/content/fifth-third/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fifth Third Bank</a> began hearing complaints from customers who were receiving text messages on their phones that claimed to be from the bank, warning recipients that their accounts had been locked.</p>
<p>The text messages contained a link to unlock their accounts and led customers to a Web site that mimicked the legitimate Fifth Third site. That phishing site prompted visitors to enter their account credentials &#8212; including usernames, passwords, one-time passcodes and PIN numbers &#8212; to unlock their accounts.</p>
<p>All told, that scam netted credentials for approximately 125 Fifth Third customers &#8212; most of them in or around the Cincinnati area. The crooks then used the phished data to withdraw $68,000 from 17 ATMs in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio in less than two weeks using Fifth Third&#8217;s cardless ATM function.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the SMS phishing and fraudulent withdrawals at cardless ATMs continued through October 2018, earning the scammers an additional $40,000. That is, until the bank zeroed in on four individuals suspected of perpetrating the crime spree. Shortly thereafter, four men were arrested in connection with the crimes. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/sms-phishing-cardless-atm-profit/#more-45481" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A year after offering free credit monitoring to all Americans on account of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=equifax+breach&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its massive data breach</a> that exposed the personal information of nearly 148 million people, <strong>Equifax</strong> now says it has chosen to extend the offer by turning to a credit monitoring service offered by a top competitor &#8212; <strong>Experian</strong>. And to do that, it will soon be sharing with Experian contact information that affected consumers gave to Equifax in order to sign up for the service.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45491" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/equiferian.png" alt="" width="479" height="73" /></p>
<p>The news came in an email Equifax is sending to people who took the company up on its offer for one year of free credit monitoring through its <strong>TrustedID Premier</strong> service.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the introduction from that message:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We recently sent you an email advising you that, until further notice, we would be extending the free TrustedID<sup>®</sup> Premier subscription you enrolled in following the September 7, 2017 cybersecurity incident. We are now pleased to let you know that Equifax has chosen Experian<sup>®</sup>, one of the three nationwide credit bureaus, to provide you with an additional year of free credit monitoring service. This extension is at <strong>no cost to you</strong> , and you will not be asked to provide a credit card number or other payment information. You have <a dir="ltr">until January 31, 2019</a> to enroll in this extension of free credit monitoring through IDnotify&#x2122;, a part of Experian.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Equifax says it will share the name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and self-provided phone number and email address with Experian for anyone who signed up for its original TrustedID Premier offering. That is, unless those folks affirmatively opt-out of having that information transferred from Equifax to Experian.</p>
<p>But not to worry, Equifax says: Experian already has most of this data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Experian currently has and is using this information (except phone number and email address) in the fulfillment of the Experian file monitoring which is part of your current service with TrustedID Premier,&#8221; Equifax wrote in its email. &#8220;Experian will only use the information Equifax is sharing to confirm your identity and securely enroll you in the Experian product, and will not use it for marketing or solicitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though people who don&#8217;t opt-out of the new IDnotify offer will have their contact information automatically shared with Experian, TrustedID Premier users must still affirmatively enroll in the new program before then end of January 2019 &#8212; the date the TrustedID product expires.</p>
<p>Equifax&#8217;s FAQ on the changes is available <a href="https://www.trustedid.com/premier/faqs_notification_experian.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/equifax-has-chosen-experian-wait-what/#more-45487" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The convicted co-author of the highly disruptive <strong>Mirai</strong> botnet malware strain has been sentenced to 2,500 hours of community service, six months home confinement, and ordered to pay $8.6 million in restitution for repeatedly using Mirai to take down Internet services at <strong>Rutgers University</strong>, his alma mater.</p>
<div id="attachment_45113" style="width: 257px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45113" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45113" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jha-li.png" alt="" width="247" height="247" /><p id="caption-attachment-45113" class="wp-caption-text">Paras Jha, in an undated photo from his former LinkedIn profile.</p></div>
<p><strong>Paras Jha,</strong> a 22-year-old computer whiz from Fanwood, N.J., was studying computer science at Rutgers when he developed Mirai along with two other convicted co-conspirators. According to sentencing memo submitted by government prosecutors, in his freshman and sophomore years at Rutgers Jha used a collection of hacked devices to launch at least four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) attacks against the university&#8217;s networks.</p>
<p>Jha told investigators he carried out the attacks not for profit but purely for personal, juvenile reasons: &#8220;He reveled in the uproar caused by the first attack, which he launched to delay upper-classmen registration for an advanced computer science class he wanted to take,&#8221; the government&#8217;s sentencing memo stated. &#8220;The second attack was launched to delay his calculus exam. The last two attacks were motivated in part by the publicity and outrage&#8221; his previous attacks had generated. Jha would later drop out of Rutgers after struggling academically.</p>
<p>In January 2017, almost a year before Jha&#8217;s arrest and guilty plea, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified Jha as the likely co-author of Mirai</a> &#8212; which sprang to notoriety after <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a record-smashing Sept. 2016 attack</a> that sidelined this Web site for nearly four days.</p>
<p>That story posited that Jha, operating under the pseudonyms &#8220;Ogmemes&#8221; and &#8220;OgRichardStallman,&#8221; gave interviews with a local paper in which he taunted Rutgers and encouraged the school to consider purchasing some kind of DDoS protection service to ward off future attacks. At the time, Jha was president and co-founder of <strong>ProTraf Solutions</strong>, a DDoS mitigation firm that provided just such a service. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/mirai-co-author-gets-6-months-confinement-8-6m-in-fines-for-rutgers-attacks/#more-45452" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
