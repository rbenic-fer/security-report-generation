												<p>Tiny hidden spy cameras are a common sight at ATMs that have been tampered with by crooks who specialize in retrofitting the machines with card skimmers. But until this past week I&#8217;d never heard of hidden cameras being used at gas pumps in tandem with Bluetooth-based card skimming devices.</p>
<p>Apparently, I&#8217;m not alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe this is the first time I’ve seen a camera on a gas pump with a Bluetooth card skimmer,&#8221; said <strong>Detective Matt Jogodka </strong>of the Las Vegas Police Department, referring to the compromised fuel pump pictured below.</p>
<div id="attachment_49597" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49597" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-49597" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/btpskimpanel.png" alt="" width="595" height="307" /><p id="caption-attachment-49597" class="wp-caption-text">The fake panel (horizontal) above the &#8220;This Sale&#8221; display obscures a tiny hidden camera angled toward the gas pump&#8217;s PIN pad.</p></div>
<p>It may be difficult to tell from the angle of the photograph above, but the horizontal bar across the top of the machine (just above the &#8220;This Sale $&#8221; indicator) contains a hidden pinhole camera angled so as to record debit card users entering their PIN.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the fake panel removed from the compromised pump:</p>
<div id="attachment_49598" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49598" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-49598" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/btpumpskimcamface.png" alt="" width="596" height="193" /><p id="caption-attachment-49598" class="wp-caption-text">A front view of the hidden camera panel.</p></div>
<p>Jogodka said although this pump&#8217;s PIN pad is encrypted, the hidden camera sidesteps that security feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PIN pad is encrypted, so this is a NEW way to capture the PIN,&#8221; Jogodka wrote in a message to a mailing list about skimming devices found on Arizona fuel pumps. &#8220;The camera was set on Motion, [to] save memory space and battery life. Sad for the suspect, it was recovered 2 hours after it was installed.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/hidden-cam-above-bluetooth-pump-skimmer/#more-49592" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A ransomware outbreak has besieged a Wisconsin based IT company that provides cloud data hosting, security and access management to more than 100 nursing homes across the United States. The ongoing attack is preventing these care centers from accessing crucial patient medical records, and the IT company&#8217;s owner says she fears this incident could soon lead not only to the closure of her business, but also to the untimely demise of some patients.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-49623" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vcpi.png" alt="" width="596" height="297" /></p>
<p>Milwaukee, Wisc. based <a href="https://www.vcpi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual Care Provider Inc.</a> (VCPI) provides IT consulting, Internet access, data storage and security services to some 110 nursing homes and acute-care facilities in 45 states. All told, VCPI is responsible for maintaining approximately 80,000 computers and servers that assist those facilities.</p>
<p>At around 1:30 a.m. CT on Nov. 17, unknown attackers launched a ransomware strain known as <strong>Ryuk</strong> inside VCPI&#8217;s networks, encrypting all data the company hosts for its clients and demanding a whopping $14 million ransom in exchange for a digital key needed to unlock access to the files. Ryuk has made a name for itself targeting businesses that supply services to other companies — particularly cloud-data firms — with the ransom demands set according to the victim’s perceived ability to pay.</p>
<p>In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity today, VCPI chief executive and owner <strong>Karen Christianson</strong> said the attack had affected virtually all of their core offerings, including Internet service and email, access to patient records, client billing and phone systems, and even VCPI&#8217;s own payroll operations that serve nearly 150 company employees.</p>
<p>The care facilities that VCPI serves access their records and other systems outsourced to VCPI by using a <a href="https://www.citrix.com/networking/consolidate-remote-access.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citrix-based</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual private networking</a> (VPN) platform, and Christianson said restoring customer access to this functionality is the company&#8217;s top priority right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have employees asking when we&#8217;re going to make payroll,&#8221; Christianson said. &#8220;But right now all we&#8217;re dealing with is getting electronic medical records back up and life-threatening situations handled first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christianson said her firm cannot afford to pay the ransom amount being demanded &#8212; roughly $14 million worth of Bitcoin &#8212; and said some clients will soon be in danger of having to shut their doors if VCPI can&#8217;t recover from the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got some facilities where the nurses can&#8217;t get the drugs updated and the order put in so the drugs can arrive on time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In another case, we have this one small assisted living place that is just a single unit that connects to billing. And if they don&#8217;t get their billing into Medicaid by December 5, they close their doors. Seniors that don&#8217;t have family to go to are then done. We have a lot of [clients] right now who are like, &#8216;Just give me my data,&#8217; but we can&#8217;t.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/110-nursing-homes-cut-off-from-health-records-in-ransomware-attack/#more-49619" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

<p>The jail time was handed down to <strong>Sergiy P. Usatyuk </strong>of Orland Park, Ill., who pleaded guilty in February to one count of conspiracy to cause damage to Internet-connected computers and owning, administering and supporting illegal “booter” or “stresser” services designed to knock Web sites offline, including <strong>exostress[.]in</strong>, <strong>quezstresser[.]com</strong>, <strong>betabooter[.]com</strong>, <strong>databooter[.]com</strong>, <strong>instabooter[.]com</strong>, <strong>polystress[.]com</strong> and <strong>zstress[.]net</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>U.S. Justice Department,</strong> in just the first 13 months of the 27-month long conspiracy, Usatyuk&#8217;s booter users ordered approximately 3,829,812 DDoS attacks. As of September 12, 2017, ExoStresser advertised on its website that this one booter service had launched 1,367,610 DDoS attacks, and caused targets to suffer 109,186.4 hours of network downtime (-4,549 days).</p>
<p>Usatyuk — operating under the hacker aliases “Andrew Quez” and “Brian Martinez,” among others — admitted developing, controlling and operating the aforementioned booter services from around August 2015 through November 2017. But Usatyuk’s involvement in the DDoS-for-hire space very much predates that period.</p>
<p>In February 2014, KrebsOnSecurity reached out to Usatyuk’s father <strong>Peter Usatyuk</strong>, an assistant professor at the <strong>University of Illinois at Chicago</strong>. I did so because a brief amount of sleuthing on Hackforums[.]net revealed that his then 15-year-old son Sergiy — who at the time went by the nicknames “Rasbora” and “Mr. Booter Master” — was heavily involved in helping to launch crippling DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>I phoned Usatyuk the elder because Sergiy’s alter egos had been posting evidence on Hackforums and elsewhere that he’d just hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a 200 Gbps DDoS attack, which was then considered a fairly impressive DDoS assault.</p>
<p>“I am writing you after our phone conversation just to confirm that you may call evening time/weekend to talk to my son Sergio regarding to your reasons,” Peter Usatyuk wrote in an email to this author on Feb. 13, 2014. “I also have [a] major concern what my 15 yo son [is] doing. If you think that is any kind of illegal work, please, let me know.” <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/ddos-for-hire-boss-gets-13-months-jail-time/#more-49609" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>National Veterinary Associates</strong> (NVA), a California company that owns more than 700 animal care facilities around the globe, is still working to recover from a ransomware attack late last month that affected more than half of those properties, separating many veterinary practices from their patient records, payment systems and practice management software. NVA says it expects to have all facilities fully back up and running normally within the next week.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-49579" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nva700.png" alt="" width="596" height="378" /></p>
<p>Agoura Hills, Calif.-based NVA bills itself as is the largest private owner of freestanding veterinary hospitals in the United States. The company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web site</a> says it currently owns roughly 700 veterinary hospitals and animal boarding facilities in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>NVA said it discovered the ransomware outbreak on the morning of Sunday, Oct. 27, and soon after hired two outside security firms to investigate and remediate the attack. A source close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that NVA was hit with <strong>Ryuk</strong>, a ransomware strain first spotted in August 2018 that targets mostly large organizations for a high-ransom return.</p>
<p>NVA declined to answer questions about the malware, or whether the NVA paid the ransom demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was ransomware, but we&#8217;ve been referring to it as a malware incident,&#8221; said <strong>Laura Koester</strong>, NVA&#8217;s chief marketing officer.</p>
<p>Koester said because every NVA hospital runs their IT operations as they see fit, not all were affected. More importantly, she said, all of the NVA&#8217;s hospitals have remained open and able to see clients (animals in need of care), and access to patient records has been fully restored to all affected hospitals.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a few days, some [pet owners] couldn&#8217;t do online bookings, and some hospitals had to look at different records for their patients,&#8221; Koester said. &#8220;But throughout this whole thing, if there was a sick animal, we saw them. No one closed their doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The source close to the investigation painted a slight less rosy picture of the situation at NVA, and said the company&#8217;s response has been complicated by the effects of wildfires surrounding its headquarters in Los Angeles County: A year ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolsey_Fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a destructive wildfire in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties</a> burned almost 100,00 acres, destroyed more than 1,600 structures, killed three people and prompted the evacuation of nearly 300,000 people &#8212; including all residents of Agoura Hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;The support center was scheduled to be closed on Friday Oct 25, 2019 due to poor air quality caused by wildfires to the north,&#8221; said the source, who asked to remain anonymous. &#8220;Around 2 am PT [Oct. 27], the Ryuk virus was unleashed at <span class="il">NVA</span>. Approximately 400 locations were infected. [Microsoft] Active Directory and Exchange servers were infected. Many of the infected locations immediately lost access to their Patient Information Management systems (PIMs). These locations were immediately unable to provide care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The source shared internal communications from different NVA executives to their hospitals about the extent of the remediation efforts and possible source of the compromise, which seemed to suggest that at least some NVA properties have been struggling to accommodate patients. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/ransomware-bites-400-veterinary-hospitals/#more-49503" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>The Russian government has for the past four years been fighting to keep 29-year-old alleged cybercriminal <strong>Aleksei Burkov</strong> from being extradited by Israel to the United States. When Israeli authorities turned down requests to send him back to Russia &#8212; supposedly to face separate hacking charges there &#8212; the Russians then imprisoned an Israeli woman for seven years on trumped-up drug charges in a bid to trade prisoners. That effort failed as well, and Burkov had his first appearance in a U.S. court last week. What follows are some clues that might explain why the Russians are so eager to reclaim this young man.</p>
<div id="attachment_49530" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49530" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-49530" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/burkov-jerusalem-getty.png" alt="" width="595" height="375" /><p id="caption-attachment-49530" class="wp-caption-text">Aleksei Burkov, seated second from right, attends a hearing in Jerusalem in 2015. Andrei Shirokov / Tass via Getty Images.</p></div>
<p>On the surface, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Burkov-Superceding.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the charges</a> the U.S. government has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/suspected-hacker-s-extradition-focuses-attention-israeli-american-russian-jail-n1079781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveled against Burkov</a> may seem fairly unremarkable: Prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/russian-national-extradited-running-online-criminal-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> he ran a credit card fraud forum called <strong>CardPlanet</strong> that sold more than 150,000 stolen cards.</p>
<p>However, a deep dive into the various pseudonyms allegedly used by Burkov suggests this individual may be one of the most connected and skilled malicious hackers ever apprehended by U.S. authorities, and that the Russian government is probably concerned that he simply knows too much.</p>
<p>Burkov calls himself a specialist in information security and denies having committed the crimes for which he&#8217;s been charged. But according to denizens of several Russian-language cybercrime forums that have been following his case in the Israeli news media, Burkov was by all accounts an elite cybercrook who primarily operated under the hacker alias &#8220;<strong>K0pa</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the same nickname used by an individual who served as co-administrator of perhaps the most exclusive Russian-language hacking forums ever created, including <strong>Mazafaka</strong> and <strong>DirectConnection</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_49526" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maza.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49526" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-49526" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maza.png" alt="" width="597" height="226" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-49526" class="wp-caption-text">A screen shot from the Mazafaka cybercrime forum, circa 2011.</p></div>
<p>Since their inception in the mid-aughts, both of these forums have been among the most difficult to join &#8212; admitting only native Russian speakers and requiring each applicant to furnish a non-refundable cash deposit and &#8220;vouches&#8221; or guarantees from at least three existing members. Also, neither forum was accessible or even visible to anyone without a special encryption certificate supplied by forum administrators that allowed the sites to load properly in a Web browser.</p>
<div id="attachment_49525" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dc-ws.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49525" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-49525" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dc-ws.png" alt="" width="594" height="320" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-49525" class="wp-caption-text">DirectConnection, circa 2011. The identity shown at the bottom of this screenshot &#8212; Severa &#8212; belonged to Peter Levashov, a prolific spammer who pleaded guilty in the United States last year to operating the Kelihos spam botnet.</p></div>
<p>Notably, some of the world&#8217;s most-wanted cybercriminals were members of these two highly exclusive forums, and many of those individuals have already been arrested, extradited and tried for various cybercrime charges in the United States over the years. Those include convicted credit card fraudsters <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/badb-rbs-worldpay-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vladislav &#8220;Badb&#8221; Horohorin</a> and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=zo0mer&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sergey &#8220;zo0mer&#8221; Kozerev</a>, as well as the infamous spammer and botnet master <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=severa+waledac&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter &#8220;Severa&#8221; Levashov</a>.</p>
<p>A user database obtained by KrebsOnSecurity several years back indicates K0pa relied on the same email address he used to register at Mazafaka and DirectConnection to register the user account &#8220;<strong>Botnet</strong>&#8221; on <strong>Spamdot</strong>, which for years was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/09/spam-affialite-program-spamit-com-to-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the closely-guarded stomping ground</a> of the world&#8217;s most prolific spammers and virus writers, as well as hackers who created services catering to both professions.</p>
<p>As a reporter for <em>The Washington Post</em> in 2008, I wrote about the core offering that K0pa/Botnet advertised on Spamdot and other exclusive forums: <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/11/web_fraud_20_faking_your_inter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A botnet-based anonymity service called <strong>FraudCrew</strong></a>. This service sold access to hacked computers, which FraudCrew customers used for the purposes of hiding their real location online while conducting cybercriminal activities.</p>
<div id="attachment_49524" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fraudcrew.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49524" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-49524" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fraudcrew.png" alt="" width="593" height="401" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-49524" class="wp-caption-text">FraudCrew, a botnet-based anonymity service offered by K0pa.</p></div>
<p>K0pa also was a top staff member at <strong>Verified</strong>, among the oldest and most venerated of Russian language cybercrime forums. Specifically, K0pa&#8217;s role at Verified was in maintaining its blacklist, a dispute resolution process designed to weed out &#8220;dishonest&#8221; cybercriminals who seek only to rip off less experienced crooks. From this vantage point, K0pa would have held considerable sway on the forum, and almost certainly played a key role in vetting new applicants to the site. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/why-were-the-russians-so-set-against-this-hacker-being-extradited/#more-49519" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In July 2016, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/canadian-man-is-author-of-popular-orcus-rat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a story</a> identifying a Toronto man as the author of the <strong>Orcus RAT</strong>, a software product that’s been marketed on underground forums and used in countless malware attacks since its creation in 2015. This week, Canadian authorities criminally charged him with orchestrating an international malware scheme.</p>
<div id="attachment_47154" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47154" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-47154" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/orcusad.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="244" /><p id="caption-attachment-47154" class="wp-caption-text">An advertisement for Orcus RAT.</p></div>
<p>The accused, 36-year-old <strong>John &#8220;Armada&#8221; Revesz</strong>, has maintained that Orcus is a legitimate &#8220;<strong>R</strong>emote <strong>A</strong>dministration <strong>T</strong>ool&#8221; aimed at helping system administrators remotely manage their computers, and that he&#8217;s not responsible for how licensed customers use his product.</p>
<p>In my 2016 piece, however, several sources noted that Armada and his team were marketing it more like a <strong>R</strong>emote <strong>A</strong>ccess <strong>T</strong>rojan, providing ongoing technical support and help to customers who&#8217;d purchased Orcus but were having trouble figuring out how to infect new machines or hide their activities online.</p>
<p>Follow-up reporting revealed that the list of features and plugins advertised for Orcus includes functionality that goes significantly beyond what one might see in a traditional remote administration tool, such as DDoS-for-hire capabilities, and the ability to disable the light indicator on webcams so as not to alert the target that the RAT is active.</p>
<p>Canadian investigators don&#8217;t appear to be buying Revesz&#8217; claims. On Monday the <strong>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</strong> (RCMP) announced it had charged Revesz with operating an international malware distribution scheme under the company name &#8220;Orcus Technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An RCMP criminal investigation began in July 2016 after reports of a significant amount of computers were being infected with a &#8216;Remote Access Trojan&#8217; type of virus,&#8221; the agency said in <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/news/2019/charges-laid-rcmp-relation-international-malware-virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a>.</p>
<p>The RCMP filed the charges eight months after executing a search warrant at Revesz&#8217; home, where they seized several hard drives containing Orcus RAT customer names, financial transactions, and other information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The evidence obtained shows that this virus has infected computers from around the world, making thousands of victims in multiple countries,&#8221; the RCMP said.</p>
<p>Revesz did not respond to requests for comment. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/orcus-rat-author-charged-in-malware-scheme/#more-49491" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released updates to plug security holes in its software, including patches to fix at least 74 weaknesses in various flavors of <strong>Windows</strong> and programs that run on top of it. The November updates include patches for a zero-day flaw in <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> that is currently being exploited in the wild, as well as a sneaky bug in certain versions of <strong>Office for Mac</strong> that bypasses security protections and was detailed publicly prior to today&#8217;s patches.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="" width="220" height="231" />More than a dozen of the flaws tackled in this month&#8217;s release are rated &#8220;critical,&#8221; meaning they involve weaknesses that could be exploited to install malware without any action on the part of the user, except for perhaps browsing to a hacked or malicious Web site or opening a booby-trapped file attachment.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most concerning of those critical holes is a zero-day flaw in Internet <del>Exploder</del> Explorer (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1429</a>) that has already seen active exploitation. Today&#8217;s updates also address two other critical vulnerabilities in the same Windows component that handles various <a href="https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Microsoft+Script+Engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scripting languages</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft also fixed a flaw in Microsoft Office for Mac (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1457</a>) that could allow attackers to bypass security protections in some versions of the program.</p>
<p>Macros are bits of computer code that can be embedded into Office files, and malicious macros are frequently used by malware purveyors to compromise Windows systems. Usually, this takes the form of a prompt urging the user to &#8220;enable macros&#8221; once they&#8217;ve opened a booby-trapped Office document delivered via email. Thus, Office has a feature called &#8220;disable all macros without notification.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Microsoft says all versions of Office still support an older type of macros that do not respect this setting, and can be used as <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/payroll-provider-gives-extortionists-a-payday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a vector for pushing malware</a>. <strong>Will Dormann</strong> of the <a href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/125336/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CERT/CC has reported</a> that Office 2016 and 2019 for Mac will fail to prompt the user before executing these older macro types if the &#8220;Disable all macros without notification&#8221; setting is used. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/patch-tuesday-november-2019-edition/#more-49481" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong><a href="https://www.orvis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orvis</a></strong>, a Vermont-based retailer that specializes in high-end fly fishing equipment and other sporting goods, leaked hundreds of internal passwords on <strong>Pastebin.com</strong> for several weeks last month, exposing credentials the company used to manage everything from firewalls and routers to administrator accounts and database servers, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Orvis says the exposure was inadvertent, and that many of the credentials were already expired.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-49459" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orvis.png" alt="" width="594" height="445" /></p>
<p>Based in Sunderland, VT. and founded in 1856, privately-held Orvis is the oldest mail-order retailer in the United States. The company has approximately 1,700 employees, 69 retail stores and 10 outlets in the US, and 18 retail stores in the UK.</p>
<p>In late October, this author received a tip from Wisconsin-based security firm <a href="https://www.holdsecurity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hold Security</a> that a file containing a staggering number of internal usernames and passwords for Orvis had been posted to Pastebin. </p>
<p>Reached for comment about the source of the document, Orvis spokesperson <strong>Tucker Kimball</strong> said it was only available for a day before the company had it removed from Pastebin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The file contains old credentials, so many of the devices associated with the credentials are decommissioned and we took steps to address the remaining ones,&#8221; Kimball said. &#8220;We are leveraging our existing security tools to conduct an investigation to determine how this occurred.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, according to Hold Security founder <strong>Alex Holden</strong>, this enormous passwords file was actually posted to Pastebin <em>on two separate occasions last month</em>, the first being on Oct. 4, and the second Oct. 22. That finding was corroborated by <a href="https://www.4iq.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4iq.com</a>, a company that aggregates information from leaked databases online.</p>
<p>Orvis did not respond to follow-up requests for comment via phone and email; the last two email messages sent by KrebsOnSecurity to Orvis were returned simply as &#8220;blocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for employees or contractors to post bits of sensitive data to public sites like Pastebin and <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>, but the credentials file apparently published by someone working at or for Orvis is by far the most extreme example I&#8217;ve ever witnessed.</p>
<p>For instance, included in the Pastebin files from Orvis were plaintext usernames and passwords for just about every kind of online service or security product the company has used, including:</p>
<p>-Antivirus engines<br />
-Data backup services<br />
-Multiple firewall products<br />
-Linux servers<br />
-Cisco routers<br />
-Netflow data<br />
-Call recording services<br />
-DNS controls<br />
-Orvis wireless networks (public and private)<br />
-Employee wireless phone services<br />
-Oracle database servers<br />
-Microsoft 365 services<br />
-Microsoft Active Directory accounts and passwords<br />
-Battery backup systems<br />
-Security cameras<br />
-Encryption certificates<br />
-Mobile payment services<br />
-Door and Alarm Codes<br />
-FTP credentials<br />
-Apple ID credentials<br />
-Door controllers</p>
<p>By all accounts, this was a comprehensive goof: <em>The Orvis credentials file even contained the combination to a locked safe in the company&#8217; server room.</em> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/retailer-orvis-com-leaked-hundreds-of-internal-passwords-on-pastebin/#more-49405" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Hospitals that have been hit by a data breach or ransomware attack can expect to see an increase in the death rate among heart patients in the following months or years because of cybersecurity remediation efforts, a new study posits. Health industry experts say the findings should prompt a larger review of how security &#8212; or the lack thereof &#8212; may be impacting patient outcomes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49443" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ekg-fl.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Researchers at <strong>Vanderbilt University</strong>&#8216;s Owen Graduate School of Management took the <strong>Department of Health and Human Services</strong> (HHS) list of healthcare data breaches and used it to drill down on data about patient mortality rates at more than 3,000 Medicare-certified hospitals, about 10 percent of which had experienced a data breach.</p>
<p>As <strong>PBS</strong> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/ransomware-and-other-data-breaches-linked-to-uptick-in-fatal-heart-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted in its coverage</a> of the Vanderbilt study, after data breaches as many as 36 additional deaths per 10,000 heart attacks occurred annually at the hundreds of hospitals examined.</p>
<p>The researchers found that for care centers that experienced a breach, it took an additional 2.7 minutes for suspected heart attack patients to receive an electrocardiogram.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breach remediation efforts were associated with deterioration in timeliness of care and patient outcomes,&#8221; the authors found. &#8220;Remediation activity may introduce changes that delay, complicate or disrupt health IT and patient care processes.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Leo Scanlon</strong>, former deputy chief information security officer at the HHS, said the findings in this report practically beg for a similar study to be done in the United Kingdom, whose healthcare system was particularly disrupted by the Wannacry virus, a global contagion in May 2017 that spread through a Microsoft Windows vulnerability prevalent in older healthcare systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exploitation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities is killing people,&#8221; Scanlon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;There is a lot of possible research that might be unleashed by this study. I believe that nothing less than a congressional investigation will give the subject the attention it deserves.&#8221;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Investigation-WannaCry-cyber-attack-and-the-NHS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-mortem on the impact of WannaCry</a> found the outbreak cost U.K. hospitals almost $100 million pounds and caused significant disruption to patient care, such as the cancellation of some 19,000 appointments &#8212; including operations &#8212; and the disruption of IT systems for at least a third of all <strong>U.K. National Health Service</strong> (NHS) hospitals and eight percent of general practitioners. In several cases, hospitals in the U.K. were forced to divert emergency room visitors to other hospitals.</p>
<p>But what isn’t yet known is how Wannacry affected mortality rates among heart attack and stroke patients whose ambulances were diverted to other hospitals because of IT system outages related to the malware. Or how many hospitals and practices experienced delays in getting test results back needed to make critical healthcare decisions.</p>
<p>Scanlon said although he&#8217;s asked around quite a bit over the years to see if any researchers have taken up the challenge of finding out, and that so far he hasn&#8217;t found anyone doing that analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;A colleague who is familiar with large scale healthcare data sets told me that unless you are associated with a research institution, it would be almost impossible to pry that kind of data out of the institutions that have it,&#8221; Scanlon said. &#8220;The problem is this data is hard to come by &#8212; nobody likes to admit that death can be attributable to a non-natural cause like this &#8212; and is otherwise considered sensitive at a very high and proprietary level by the institutions that have the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>A study published <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1614073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the April 2017 edition</a> of <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> would seem to suggest applying the approach used by the Vanderbilt researchers to measuring patient outcomes at U.K. hospitals in the wake of Wannacry might be worth carrying out.</p>
<p>In the NEJM study, morbidity and mortality data was used to show that there is a measurable impact when ambulances and emergency response teams are removed from normal service and redirected to standby during public events like marathons and other potential targets of terrorism.</p>
<p>The study found that &#8220;medicare beneficiaries who were admitted to marathon-affected hospitals with acute myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest on marathon dates had longer ambulance transport times before noon (4.4 minutes longer) and higher 30-day mortality than beneficiaries who were hospitalized on nonmarathon dates.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/study-ransomware-data-breaches-at-hospitals-tied-to-uptick-in-fatal-heart-attacks/#more-49338" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Banking industry giant <strong>NCR Corp.</strong> [<a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS858US858&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTT8RakelvmicXkMqpkUldtImdgMg:1572815817512&amp;q=NYSE:+NCR&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDZPNCouKTcpyeRaxcvpFBrtaKfg5BwEA0iv3ekkAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwik_-XA-87lAhVkvFkKHfwDCXQQsRUwHnoECAgQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSE: NCR</a>] late last month took the unusual step of temporarily blocking third-party financial data aggregators <strong>Mint</strong> and <strong>QuickBooks Online</strong> from accessing <strong>Digital Insight</strong>, an online banking platform used by hundreds of financial institutions. That ban, which came in response to a series of bank account takeovers in which cybercriminals used aggregation sites to surveil and drain consumer accounts, has since been rescinded. But the incident raises fresh questions about the proper role of digital banking platforms in fighting password abuse.</p>
<div id="attachment_49418" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ncr3rd.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49418" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-49418" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ncr3rd.png" alt="" width="596" height="406" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-49418" class="wp-caption-text">Part of a communication NCR sent Oct. 25 to banks on its Digital Insight online banking platform.</p></div>
<p>On Oct. 29, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a chief security officer at a U.S.-based credit union and Digital Insight customer who said his institution just had several dozen customer accounts hacked over the previous week.</p>
<p>My banking source said the attackers appeared to automate the unauthorized logins, which took place over a week in several distinct 12-hour periods in which a new account was accessed every five to ten minutes.</p>
<p>Most concerning, the source said, was that in many cases the aggregator service did not pass through prompts sent by the credit union&#8217;s site for multi-factor authentication, meaning the attackers could access customer accounts with nothing more than a username and password.</p>
<p>&#8220;The weird part is sometimes the attackers are getting the multi-factor challenge, and sometimes they aren&#8217;t,&#8221; said the source, who added that he suspected a breach at Mint and/QuickBooks because NCR had just blocked the two companies from accessing bank Web sites on its platform.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity, NCR said that on Friday, Oct. 25, the company notified Digital Insight customers &#8220;that the aggregation capabilities of certain third-party product were being temporarily suspended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The notification was sent while we investigated a report involving a single user and a third-party product that aggregates bank data,&#8221; reads their statement, which was sent to customers on Oct. 29. After confirming that the incident was contained, NCR restored connectivity that is used for account aggregation. &#8220;As we noted, the criminals are getting aggressive and creative in accessing tools to access online information, NCR continues to evaluate and proactively defend against these activities.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>What were these sophisticated methods? NCR wouldn&#8217;t say, but it seems clear the hacked accounts are tied to customers re-using their online banking passwords at other sites that got hacked.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier this year in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/the-risk-of-weak-online-banking-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Risk of Weak Online Banking Passwords</a>, if you bank online and choose weak or re-used passwords, there’s a decent chance your account could be pilfered by cyberthieves — even if your bank offers multi-factor authentication as part of its login process. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/ncr-barred-mint-quickbooks-from-banking-platform-during-account-takeover-storm/#more-49409" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
