												<p>Not long ago I heard from a reader who wanted advice on how to stop someone from scanning his home network, or at least recommendations about to whom he should report the person doing the scanning. I couldn&#8217;t believe that people actually still cared about scanning, and I told him as much: These days there are countless entities &#8212; some benign and research-oriented, and some less benign &#8212; that are continuously mapping and cataloging virtually every device that&#8217;s put online.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GF5.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-30923" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GF5.png" alt="GF5" width="238" height="190" /></a>One of the more benign is <a href="https://scans.io/" target="_blank">scans.io</a>, a data repository of research findings collected through continuous scans of the public Internet. The project, hosted by the <a href="https://zmap.io/" target="_blank">ZMap Team</a> at the <strong>University of Michigan</strong>, includes huge, regularly updated results grouped around scanning for Internet hosts running some of the most commonly used &#8220;ports&#8221; or network entryways, such as Port 443 (think Web sites protected by the lock icon denoting SSL/TLS Web site encryption); Port 21, or file transfer protocol (FTP); and Port 25, or simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), used by many businesses to send email.</p>
<p>When I was first getting my feet wet on the security beat roughly 15 years ago, the practice of scanning networks you didn&#8217;t own looking for the virtual equivalent of open doors and windows was still fairly frowned upon &#8212; if not grounds to get one into legal trouble. These days, complaining about being scanned is about as useful as griping that the top of your home is viewable via <strong>Google Earth</strong>. Trying to put devices on the Internet and then hoping that someone or something won&#8217;t find them is one of the most futile exercises in security-by-obscurity.</p>
<p>To get a gut check on this, I spoke at length last week with University of Michigan researcher <strong>Zakir Durumeric </strong>(ZD) and <strong>Michael D. Bailey </strong>at the <strong>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</strong> (MB) about their ongoing and very public project to scan all the Internet-facing things. I was curious to get their perspective on how public perception of widespread Internet scanning has changed over the years, and how targeted scanning can actually lead to beneficial results for Internet users as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>MB:</strong> Because of the historic bias against scanning and this debate between disclosure and security-by-obscurity, we&#8217;ve approached this very carefully. We certainly think that the benefits of publishing this information are huge, and that we&#8217;re just scratching the surface of what we can learn from it.</p>
<p><strong>ZD:</strong> Yes, there are close to two dozen papers published now based on broad, Internet-wide scanning. People who are more focused on comprehensive scans tend to be the more serious publications that are trying to do statistical or large-scale analyses that are complete, versus just finding devices on the Internet. It&#8217;s really been in the last year that we&#8217;ve started ramping up and adding scans [to the scans.io site] more frequently.</p>
<p><strong>BK: What are your short- and long-term goals with this project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZD:</strong> I think long-term we do want to add coverage of additional protocols. A lot of what we’re focused on is different aspects of a protocol. For example, if you&#8217;re looking at hosts running the &#8220;https://&#8221; protocol, there are many different ways you can ask questions depending on what perspective you come from. You see different attributes and behavior. So a lot of what we&#8217;ve done has revolved around https, which is of course hot right now within the research community.</p>
<p><strong>MB:</strong> I’m excited to add other protocols. There are a handful of protocols that are critical to operations of the Internet, and I&#8217;m very interested in understanding the deployment of DNS, BGP, and TLS&#8217;s interception with SMTP. Right now, there’s a pretty long tail to all of these protocols, and so that&#8217;s where it starts to get interesting. We&#8217;d like to start looking at things like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and things that are responding from industrial control systems.</p>
<p><strong>ZD:</strong> One of the things we’re trying to pay more attention to is the world of embedded devices, or this &#8216;Internet of Things&#8217; phenomenon. As Michael said, there are also industrial protocols, and there are different protocols that these embedded devices are supporting, and I think we’ll continue to add protocols around that class of devices as well because from a security perspective it&#8217;s incredibly interesting which devices are popping up on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>BK: What are some of the things you&#8217;ve found in your aggregate scanning results that surprised you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZD: </strong>I think one thing in the &#8220;https://&#8221; world that really popped out was we have this very large certificate authority ecosystem, and a lot of the attention is focused on a small number of authorities, but actually there is this very long tail &#8212; there are hundreds of certificate authorities that we don&#8217;t really think about on a daily basis, but that still have permission to sign for any Web site. That&#8217;s something we didn&#8217;t necessary expect. We knew there were a lot, but we didn&#8217;t really know what would come up until we looked at those.</p>
<p>There also was work we did a couple of years ago on cryptographic keys and how those are shared between devices. In one example, primes were being shared between RSA keys, and because of this we were able to factor a large number of keys, but we really wouldn&#8217;t have seen that unless we started to dig into that aspect [their research paper on this is available <a href="https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/https-imc13.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>].</p>
<p><strong>MB:</strong> One of things we’ve been surprised about is when we measure these things at scale in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, often times these kinds of emergent behaviors become clear.</p>
<p><strong>BK: Talk about what you hope to do with all this data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZD:</strong> We were involved a lot in the analysis of the Heartbleed vulnerability. And one of the surprising developments there wasn&#8217;t that there were lots of people vulnerable, but it was interesting to see who patched, how and how quickly. What we were able to find was by taking the data from these scans and actually doing vulnerability notifications to everybody, we were able to increase patching for the Heartbleed bug by 50 percent. So there was an interesting kind of surprise there, not what you learn from looking at the data, but in terms of what actions do you take from that analysis? And that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re incredibly interested in: Which is how can we spur progress within the community to improve security, whether that be through vulnerability notification, or helping with configurations.</p>
<p><strong>BK: How do you know your notifications helped speed up patching?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MB:</strong> With the Heartbleed vulnerability, we took the known vulnerable population from scans, and ran an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing" target="_blank">A/B test.</a> We split the population that was vulnerable in half and notified one half of the population, while not notifying the other half, and then measured the difference in patching rates between the two populations. We did end up after a week notifying the second population&#8230;the other half. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/whos-scanning-your-network-a-everyone/#more-30752" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>This week, nationwide beauty products chain Sally Beauty disclosed that, for the second time in a year, it was investigating reports that hackers had broken into its networks and stolen customer credit card data. That investigation is ongoing, but I recently had an opportunity to interview a former Sally Beauty IT technician who provided a first-hand look at how the first breach in 2014 went down.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sallyb.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-30895" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sallyb.png" alt="sallyb" width="309" height="190" /></a>On March 14, 2014, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that some 260,000 credit cards stolen from Sally Beauty stores had gone up for sale on <strong>Rescator[dot]cc</strong>, the same shop that first debuted cards stolen in the Home Depot and Target breaches. The company said thieves made off with just 25,000 customer cards. But the shop selling the cards listed each by the ZIP code of the Sally Beauty store from which the card data had been stolen, exactly like this same shop did with <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/09/data-nearly-all-u-s-home-depot-stores-hit/" target="_blank">Home Depot</a> and <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/cards-stolen-in-target-breach-flood-underground-markets/" target="_blank">Target</a>. <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/03/zip-codes-show-extent-of-sally-beauty-breach/" target="_blank">An exhaustive analysis</a> of the ZIP codes represented in the cards for sale on the fraud shop indicated that the hackers had hit virtually all 2,600 Sally Beauty locations nationwide.</p>
<p>The company never disclosed additional details about the breach itself or how it happened. But earlier this week I spoke with <strong>Blake Curlovic</strong>, until recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcurlovic" target="_blank">an application support analyst</a> at Sally Beauty who was among the first to respond when virtual alarm bells starting going off last year about a possible intrusion. Curlovic said that at the time, Sally Beauty was running exactly one enterprise solution for security &#8212; <a href="http;//www.tripwire.com" target="_blank">Tripwire</a> (full disclosure: Tripwire is an advertiser on this blog). Tripwire&#8217;s core product monitors key operating system and application files for any changes, which then triggers alerts.</p>
<p>Tripwire fired a warning when the intruders planted a new file on point-of-sale systems within Sally Beauty&#8217;s vast network of cash registers. The file was a program designed to steal card numbers as they were being swiped through the registers, and the attackers had named their malware after a legitimate program running on all Sally Beauty registers. They also used a utility called <a href="http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Timestomp" target="_blank">Timestomp</a> to change the date and time stamp on their malware to match the legitimate file, but that apparently didn&#8217;t fool Tripwire.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote pqleft">According to Curlovic, the intruders gained access through a <a href="https://www.citrix.com/solutions/remote-access/overview.html" target="_blank">Citrix remote access portal</a> set up for use by employees who needed access to company systems while on the road.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The attackers somehow had login credentials of a district manager,&#8221; Curlovic said. &#8220;This guy was not exactly security savvy. When we got his laptop back in, we saw that it had his username and password taped to the front of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once inside the Sally Beauty corporate network, the attackers scanned and mapped out the entire thing, located all shared drives and scoured those for Visual Basic (VB) scripts. Network administrators in charge of managing thousands or tens of thousands of systems often will write VB scripts to automate certain tasks across all of those systems, and very often those scripts will contain usernames and passwords that can be quite useful to attackers.</p>
<p>Curlovic said the intruders located a VB script on Sally Beauty&#8217;s network that contained the username and password of a network administrator at the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;That allowed them to basically copy files to the cash registers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They used a simple batch file loop, put in all the [cash] register Internet addresses they found while scanning the network, looped through there and copied [the malware] to all of the point-of-sale devices &#8212; roughly 6,000 of them. They were in the network for like a week prior to that planning the attack.&#8221;</p>

												<p>Normally, if one wishes to buy stolen account credentials for paid online services like <strong>Netflix</strong>, <strong>Hulu</strong>, <strong>XBox</strong> <strong>Live</strong> or <strong>Spotify</strong>, the buyer needs to visit a cybercrime forum or drop into a dark Web marketplace that only accepts <strong>Bitcoin</strong> as payment. Increasingly, however, these accounts are showing up for sale at <strong>Payivy[dot]com</strong>, an open Web marketplace that happily accepts <strong>PayPal</strong> in exchange for a variety of stolen accounts.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not clear how or why PayPal isn&#8217;t shutting down most of these merchants, but some of the sellers clearly are testing things to see how far they can push it: In just five minutes of searching online, I found several PayIvy sellers who were accepting PayPal payments via PayIvy for&#8230;wait for it&#8230;hijacked PayPal accounts! The fact that PayIvy takes PayPal as payment means that buyers can purchase hacked accounts with [stolen] credit cards &#8212; or, worse yet, stolen PayPal accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Christin, Jr.</strong>, associate general counsel at PayPal, said while the site itself is not in violation of its Acceptable Use Policies (AUP), there have been cases where PayPal has identified accounts selling goods that violate its policy and in those cases, the company has exited those merchants from its system.  <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/payivy-sells-your-online-accounts-via-paypal/#more-30733" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>For the second time in a year, nationwide beauty products chain <strong>Sally Beauty Holdings Inc.</strong> says it is investigating reports of unusual credit and debit card activity at some of its U.S. stores.</p>
<p>Last week, KrebsOnSecurity began hearing from multiple financial institutions about a pattern of fraudulent charges on cards that were all recently<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sally.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-30852" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sally.png" alt="sally" width="261" height="205" /></a> used at Sally Beauty locations in various states. Reached for comment on Sunday about the fraud pattern suggesting yet another card breach at the beauty products chain, Sally Beauty issued the following statement this morning:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. is currently investigating reports of unusual activity involving payment cards used at some of our U.S. Sally Beauty stores. Since learning of these reports, we have been working with law enforcement and our credit card processor and have launched a comprehensive investigation with the help of a leading third-party forensics expert to aggressively gather facts while working to ensure our customers are protected. Until this investigation is completed, it is difficult to determine with certainty the scope or nature of any potential incident, but we will continue to work vigilantly to address any potential issues that may affect our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their statement continues: &#8220;Consistent with our &#8216;Love it or Return It&#8217; policy, customer security and confidence remains our number one priority. As a result, we encourage any customer who is concerned about the security of their payment cards to call our Customer Service Hotline at 1-866-234-9442, so that we can assist them in addressing any potential concerns. Sally Beauty will, as appropriate, provide updates as we learn more from our investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the company also sent out an urgent alert today to its employees, asking associates to direct any customers with credit card issues to the Sally Beauty Web site or to call customer service. &#8220;We hadn&#8217;t gotten an email like that since last year when we had our breach,&#8221; the Sally Beauty employee said on condition of anonymity. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/sally-beauty-card-breach-part-deux/#more-30835" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Credit and debit card skimmers secretly attached to gas pumps are an increasingly common scourge throughout the United States. But the tables can be turned when these fraud devices are discovered, as evidenced by one California police department that has eschewed costly and time-consuming stakeouts in favor of affixing GPS tracking devices to the skimmers and then waiting for thieves to come collect their bounty.</p>
<p>One morning last year the Redlands, Calif. police department received a call about a skimming device that was found attached to a local gas pump. This wasn&#8217;t the first call of the day about such a discovery, but Redlands police didn&#8217;t exactly have time to stake out the compromised pumps. Instead, they attached a specially-made GPS tracking device to the pump skimmer.</p>
<div id="attachment_30840" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/skimwithgps.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30840" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-30840" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/skimwithgps-580x565.png" alt="A gas pump skimmer retrofitted with a GPS tracking device.

Image: 3VR&#8217;s Crimedex Alert System.</p></div>
<p>At around 5 a.m. the next morning, a computer screen at the Redlands PD indicated that the compromised skimming device was on the move. The GPS device that the cops had hidden inside the skimmer was beaconing its location every six seconds, and the police were quickly able to determine that the skimmer was heading down a highway adjacent to the gas station and traveling at more than 50 MPH. Using handheld radios to pinpoint the exact location of the tracker, the police were able to locate the suspects, who were caught with several other devices implicating them in an organized crime ring.</p>

												<p>Last week, Allentown, Pa. based point-of-sale (POS) maker <a href="http://www.harbortouch.com" target="_blank">Harbortouch</a> disclosed that a breach involving &#8220;a small number&#8221; of its restaurant and bar customers were impacted by malicious software that allowed thieves to siphon customer card data from affected merchants. KrebsOnSecurity has recently heard from a major U.S. card issuer that says the company is radically downplaying the scope of the breach, and that the compromise appears to have impacted more than 4,200 Harbortouch customers nationwide.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/harbortouch.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-30829" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/harbortouch.png" alt="harbortouch" width="273" height="123" /></a>In the weeks leading up to the Harbortouch disclosure, many sources in the financial industry speculated that there was possibly a breach at a credit card processing company. This suspicion usually arises whenever banks start feeling a great deal of card fraud pain that they can&#8217;t easily trace back to one specific merchant (for more on why POS vendor breaches are difficult to pin down, check out <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/04/pos-providers-feel-brunt-of-poseidon-malware/" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Some banks were so anxious about the unexplained fraud spikes as stolen cards were used to buy goods at big box stores that they instituted dramatic changes to the way they processed debit card transactions. Glastonbury, Ct. based <a href="https://www.bankatunited.com/Contact-Us" target="_blank">United Bank</a> recently included a red-backgrounded notice conspicuously at the top of their home page stating: &#8220;In an effort to protect our customers after learning of a spike in fraudulent transactions in grocery stores as well as similar stores such as WalMart and Target, we have instituted a block in which customers will now be required to select &#8216;Debit&#8217; and enter their &#8216;PIN&#8217; for transactions at these stores when using their United Bank debit card.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_30824" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/QA.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30824" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-30824" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/QA-580x356.png" alt="A notice to customers of United Bank." width="580" height="356" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/QA-580x356.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/QA-940x577.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/QA.png 2020w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-30824" class="wp-caption-text">A notice to customers of United Bank.</p></div>
<p>In a statement released last week to KrebsOnSecurity, Harbortouch said it has &#8220;identified and contained an incident that affected a small percentage of our merchants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The incident involved the installation of malware on certain point of sale (POS) systems,&#8221; Harbortouch said in a written statement. &#8220;The advanced malware was designed to avoid detection by the antivirus program running on the POS System. Within hours of detecting the incident, Harbortouch identified and removed the malware from affected systems. We have engaged Mandiant, a leading forensic investigator, to assist in our ongoing investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company said the incident did not affect Harbortouch&#8217;s own network, nor was it the result of any vulnerability in the PA-DSS validated POS software.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harbortouch does not directly process or store cardholder data,&#8221; the company explained. &#8220;It is important to note that only a small percentage of our merchants were affected and over a relatively short period of time. We are working with the appropriate parties to notify the card issuing banks that were potentially impacted. Those banks can then conduct heightened monitoring of transactions to detect and prevent unauthorized charges. We are also coordinating our efforts with law enforcement to assist them in their investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, according to sources at a top 10 card-issuing bank here in the United States that shared voluminous fraud data with this author on condition of anonymity, the breach extends to at least 4,200 stores that run Harbortouch&#8217;s point-of-sale software. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/harbortouch-is-latest-pos-vendor-breach/#more-30823" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Chinese government censors at the helm of the &#8220;Great Firewall of China&#8221; appear to have inadvertently blocked Chinese Web surfers from visiting pages that call out to <em>connect.facebook.net</em>, a resource used by <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/quickstart/v2.3" target="_blank">Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;like&#8221; buttons</a>.

<p>One KrebsOnSecurity reader living in China who was inconvenienced by the glitch said he discovered the problem just by trying to access the regularly non-blocked UK newspapers online. He soon noticed a large swath of other sites were also being re-directed to the same page.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has the feel of a cyber attack rather than a new addition to the Great Firewall,&#8221; said the reader, who asked not to be identified by name. &#8220;I thought it might be malware on my laptop, but then I got an email from the IT services at my university saying the issue was nation-wide, which made me curious. It&#8217;s obviously very normal for sites to be blocked here in China, but the scale and the type of sites being blocked (and the fact that we&#8217;re being re-directed instead of the usual 404 result) suggests a problem with the Internet system itself. It doesn&#8217;t seem like the kind of thing the Chinese gov would do intentionally, which raises some interesting questions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong>, a researcher who has delved deeply into Chinese censorship tools in his role at the <a title="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">International Computer Science Institute</a> (ICSI) and the <strong>University of California, Berkeley,</strong> agrees that the blocking of connect.facebook.net by censors inside the country was likely a mistake.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Any page that had a Facebook Connect element on it that was unencrypted and visited from within China would instead get this thing which would reload the main page of wpkg.org,&#8221; Weaver said, noting that while Facebook.com always encrypts users&#8217; connections, sites that rely on Facebook &#8220;like&#8221; buttons and related resources draw those from connect.facebook.net. &#8220;That screw-up seems to have been fairly quickly corrected, but the effect of it has lingered because it got into peoples’ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank">domain name system</a> (DNS) caches.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In short, a brief misstep in censorship can have lasting and far flung repercussions. But w</span><span class="s1">hy should this be considered a screw-up by Chinese censors? For one thing, it was corrected quickly, Weaver said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Also, the Chinese censors don’t benefit from it, because this caused a huge amount of disruption to Chinese web surfers on pages that the government doesn&#8217;t want to censor,&#8221; he said.</span> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/04/china-censors-facebook-net-blocks-sites-with-like-buttons/#more-30782" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>When your credit card gets stolen because a merchant you did business with got hacked, it&#8217;s often quite easy for investigators to figure out which company was victimized. The process of divining the provenance of stolen healthcare records, however, is far trickier because these records typically are processed or handled by a gauntlet of third party firms, most of which have no direct relationship with the patient or customer ultimately harmed by the breach.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this last month, after receiving a tip from a source at a cyber intelligence firm based in California who asked to remain anonymous. My source had discovered a seller on the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/alphabay" target="_blank">darknet marketplace AlphaBay</a> who was posting stolen healthcare data into a subsection of the market called &#8220;Random DB ripoffs,&#8221; (&#8220;DB,&#8221; of course, is short for &#8220;database&#8221;).</p>
<p>Eventually, this same fraudster leaked a large text file titled, &#8220;Tenet Health Hilton Medical Center,&#8221; which contained the name, address, Social Security number and other sensitive information on dozens of physicians across the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AlphaBayHealth.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-30787" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AlphaBayHealth-580x541.png" alt="AlphaBayHealth" width="580" height="541" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AlphaBayHealth-580x541.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AlphaBayHealth-940x876.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AlphaBayHealth.png 1324w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a>Contacted by KrebsOnSecurity, <strong>Tenet Health</strong> officials said the data was not stolen from its databases, but rather from a company called <strong>InCompass Healthcare</strong>. Turns out, InCompass disclosed a breach in August 2014, which reportedly occurred after a subcontractor of one of the company&#8217;s service providers failed to secure a computer server containing account information. The affected company was <strong>24 ON Physicians</strong>, an affiliate of InCompass Healthcare.</p>
<p>&#8220;The breach affected approximately 10,000 patients treated at 29 facilities throughout the U.S. and approximately 40 employed physicians,&#8221; wrote <strong>Rebecca Kirkham</strong>, a spokeswoman for InCompass.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result, a limited amount of personal information may have been exposed to the Internet between December 1, 2013 and April 17, 2014, Kirkham wrote in an emailed statement. Information that may have been exposed included patient names, invoice numbers, procedure codes, dates of service, charge amounts, balance due, policy numbers, and billing-related status comments. Patient social security number, home address, telephone number and date of birth were not in the files that were subject to possible exposure. Additionally, no patient medical records or bank account information were put at risk. The physician information that may have been exposed included physician name, facility, provider number and social security number.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirkham said up until being contacted by this reporter, InCompass &#8220;had received no indication that personal information has been acquired or used maliciously.&#8221;</p>
<p>So who was the subcontractor that leaked the data? According to <a href="http://www.phiprivacy.net/mckesson-subsidiary-exposed-over-10000-patients-information-via-google-search-data-exposed-for-more-than-4-months/" target="_blank">PHIprivacy.net</a> (and now confirmed by InCompass), the subcontractor responsible was <strong>PST Services</strong>, a <strong>McKesson</strong> subsidiary providing medical billing services, which left more than 10,000 patients’ information exposed via Google search for over four months.</p>
<p>As this incident shows, a breach at one service provider or healthcare billing company can have a broad impact across the healthcare system, but can be quite challenging to piece together. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/04/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-stolen-healthcare-record/#more-30749" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Sendgrid</strong>, an email service used by tens of thousands of companies &#8212; including Silicon Valley giants as well as Bitcoin exchange <strong>Coinbase</strong> &#8212; said attackers compromised a Sendgrid employee&#8217;s account, which was then used to steal the usernames, email addresses and (hashed) passwords of customer and employee accounts. The announcement comes several weeks after Sendgrid sought to assure customers that the breach was limited to a single customer account.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sg1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-30770" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sg1.png" alt="sg1" width="305" height="94" /></a>On April 9, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/sendgrid-email-breach-was-used-to-attack-coinbase-a-bitcoin-exchange/?_r=0" target="_blank">reported</a> that Coinbase had its Sendgrid credentials compromised, and that thieves were apparently using the access to launch phishing attacks against Bitcoin-related businesses. Sendgrid took issue with the Times piece for implying that SendGrid had incurred a platform-wide breach. &#8220;The story has now been updated to reflect that only a single SendGrid customer account was compromised,&#8221; Sendgrid wrote in <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/phishing-attack-rocks-the-btc-community/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> published that same day.</p>
<p>Today, Sendgrid <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/update-on-security-incident-and-additional-security-measures/" target="_blank">published another post</a> walking that statement back a bit, saying it now had more information about the extent of the intrusion thanks to assistance from data breach investigators:</p>
<p>&#8220;After further investigation in collaboration with law enforcement and FireEye’s (Mandiant) Incident Response Team, we became aware that a SendGrid employee’s account had been compromised by a cyber criminal and used to access several of our internal systems on three separate dates in February and March 2015,&#8221; wrote <strong>David Campbell</strong>, Sendgrid&#8217;s chief security officer.  Campbell continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These systems contained usernames, email addresses, and (salted and iteratively hashed) passwords for SendGrid customer and employee accounts. In addition, evidence suggests that the cyber criminal accessed servers that contained some of our customers’ recipient email lists/addresses and customer contact information. We have not found any forensic evidence that customer lists or customer contact information was stolen. However, as a precautionary measure, we are implementing a system-wide password reset. Because SendGrid does not store customer payment cards we do know that payment card information was not involved.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sendgrid is urging customers to change their passwords, and to take advantage of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/two_factor_authentication.html" target="_blank">multi-factor authentication offering</a>. Sendgrid also said it is working to add more authentication methods for its two-factor security, and to expedite the release of special &#8220;API keys&#8221; that will allow customers to use keys instead of passwords for sending email through its systems.</p>
<p>Sendgrid manages billions of emails for some big brand names, including Pinterest, Spotify and Uber. This reach makes them a major target of fraudsters and spammers, who would like nothing more than to control whitelisted accounts capable of blasting out so much email each day.</p>
<p>In March 2015, U.S. prosecutors <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/03/feds-indict-three-in-2011-epsilon-hack/" target="_blank">indicted three men</a> in connection with the April 2011 compromise of commercial email giant <strong>Epsilon</strong>. Days after that break-in, customers at dozens of Fortune 500 companies <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/04/spammers-target-kroger-customers/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/04/spammers-target-kroger-customers/" target="_blank">began complaining of receiving spam</a> to email addresses they’d created specifically for use with the companies directly served by Epsilon and its network of email providers.</p>

												<p>Not long ago, I was working on a speech and found myself trying to come up with a phrase that encapsulates the difference between organizations that really make cybersecurity a part of their culture and those that merely pay it lip service and do the bare minimum (think &#8216;<a title="https://vimeo.com/102830089" href="https://vimeo.com/102830089" target="_blank">15 pieces of flair</a>&#8216;). When the phrase &#8220;security maturity&#8221; came to mind, I thought for sure I&#8217;d conceived of an original idea and catchy phrase.</p>
<p>It turns out this is already a thing. And a really notable thing at that. The graphic below, produced last year by the <a title="http://www.esg-global.com/" href="http://www.esg-global.com/" target="_blank">Enterprise Strategy Group</a>, does a nice job of explaining why some companies just don&#8217;t get it when it comes to taking effective measures to manage cyber risks and threats.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SecurityMaturity.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29580" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SecurityMaturity-600x416.png" alt="SecurityMaturity" width="600" height="416" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SecurityMaturity-600x416.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SecurityMaturity-285x198.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SecurityMaturity.png 1071w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Very often, experience is the best teacher here: Data breaches have a funny way of forcing organizations &#8212; kicking and screaming &#8212; from one vertical column to another in the Security Maturity matrix. Much depends on whether the security professionals in the breached organization have a plan (ideally, in advance of the breach) and the clout for capitalizing on the brief post-breach executive attention on security to ask for changes and resources that can assist the organization in learning from its mistakes and growing.</p>
<p>But the Security Maturity matrix doesn&#8217;t just show how things are broken: It also provides a basic roadmap for organizations that wish to change that culture. Perhaps unsurprisingly, entities that are able to manage that transition typically have a leadership that is invested in and interested in making security a core priority. The real trick is engineering ways to influence the leadership, with or without the fleeting momentum offered by a breach. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/04/whats-your-security-maturity-level/#more-28831" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
