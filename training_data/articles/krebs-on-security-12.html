												<p><strong>ValidCC</strong>, a dark web bazaar run by a cybercrime group that for more than six years hacked online merchants and sold stolen payment card data, abruptly closed up shop last week. The proprietors of the popular store said their servers were seized as part of a coordinated law enforcement operation designed to disconnect and confiscate its infrastructure.</p>
<div id="attachment_54231" style="width: 602px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54231" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-54231" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/validcc17.png" alt="" width="592" height="310" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/validcc17.png 1087w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/validcc17-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /><p id="caption-attachment-54231" class="wp-caption-text">ValidCC, circa 2017.</p></div>
<p>There are dozens of online shops that sell so-called <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/04/all-about-fraud-how-crooks-get-the-cvv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;card not present&#8221; (CNP) payment card data</a> stolen from e-commerce stores, but most source the data from other criminals. In contrast, researchers say ValidCC was actively involved in hacking and pillaging hundreds of online merchants &#8212; seeding the sites with <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/11/whos-in-your-online-shopping-cart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hidden card-skimming code</a> that siphoned personal and financial information as customers went through the checkout process.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity firm <strong>Group-IB</strong> published <a href="https://www.group-ib.com/media/ultrarank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report last year</a> detailing the activities of ValidCC, noting the gang behind the crime shop was responsible for plundering nearly 700 e-commerce sites. Group-IB dubbed the gang &#8220;<strong>UltraRank</strong>,&#8221; which it said had additionally compromised at least 13 third-party suppliers whose software components are used by countless online stores across Europe, Asia, North and Latin America.</p>
<p>Group-IB believes UltraRank is responsible for a slew of hacks that other security firms previously attributed to at least three distinct cybercrime groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over five years&#8230;.UltraRank changed its infrastructure and malicious code on numerous occasions, as a result of which cybersecurity experts would wrongly attribute its attacks to other threat actors,&#8221; Group-IB wrote. &#8220;UltraRank combined attacks on single targets with supply chain attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>ValidCC&#8217;s front man on multiple forums &#8212; a cybercriminal who uses the hacker handle &#8220;<strong>SPR</strong>&#8221; &#8212; told customers on Jan. 28 that the shop would close for good following what appeared to be a law enforcement takedown of its operations. SPR claims his site lost access to a significant inventory &#8212; more than 600,000 unsold stolen payment card accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result, we lost the proxy and destination backup servers,&#8221; SPR explained. &#8220;Besides, now it&#8217;s impossible to open and decrypt the backend. The database is in the hands of the police, but it&#8217;s encrypted.&#8221;</p>
<p>ValidCC had thousands of users, some of whom held significant balances of bitcoin stored in the shop when it ceased operations. SPR claims the site took in approximately $100,000 worth of virtual currency deposits each day from customers.</p>
<p>Many of those customers took to the various crime forums where the shop has a presence to voice suspicions that the proprietors had simply decided to walk away with their money at a time when Bitcoin was near record-high price levels.</p>
<p>SPR countered that ValidCC couldn&#8217;t return balances because it no longer had access to its own ledgers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know anything!,&#8221; SPR pleaded. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know users&#8217; balances, or your account logins or passwords, or the [credit cards] you purchased, or anything else! You are free to think what you want, but our team has never conned or let anyone down since the beginning of our operations! Nobody would abandon a dairy cow and let it die in the field! We did not take this decision lightly!&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/validcc-a-major-payment-card-bazaar-and-looter-of-e-commerce-sites-shuttered/#more-54208" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Authorities in the United Kingdom have arrested a 20-year-old man for allegedly operating an online service for sending high-volume phishing campaigns via mobile text messages. The service, marketed in the underground under the name &#8220;<strong>SMS Bandits</strong>,&#8221; has been responsible for blasting out huge volumes of phishing lures spoofing everything from COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts to PayPal, telecommunications providers and tax revenue agencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/smsbanditshome.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-54192" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/smsbanditshome.png" alt="" width="596" height="376" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/smsbanditshome.png 1001w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/smsbanditshome-768x483.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s <strong>National Crime Agency</strong> (NCA) declined to name the suspect, but confirmed that the Metropolitan Police Service&#8217;s cyber crime unit had detained an individual from Birmingham in connection to a business that supplied &#8220;criminal services related to phishing offenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proprietors of the phishing service were variously known on cybercrime forums under handles such as SMSBandits, &#8220;<strong>Gmuni</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Bamit9</strong>,&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Uncle Munis</strong>.&#8221; SMS Bandits offered an SMS phishing (a.k.a. &#8220;smishing&#8221;) service for the mass sending of text messages designed to phish account credentials for different popular websites and steal personal and financial data for resale.</p>
<div id="attachment_54197" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/smslive.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54197" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54197" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/smslive.png" alt="" width="597" height="180" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/smslive.png 1128w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/smslive-768x231.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-54197" class="wp-caption-text">Image: osint.fans</p></div>
<p><strong>Sasha Angus</strong> is a partner at <a href="https://www.scyllaintel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scylla Intel</a>, a cyber intelligence startup that did a great deal of research into the SMS Bandits leading up to the arrest. Angus said the phishing lures sent by the SMS Bandits were unusually well-done and free of grammar and spelling mistakes that often make it easy to spot a phony message.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just by virtue of these guys being native English speakers, the quality of their phishing kits and lures were considerably better than most,&#8221; Angus said.</p>
<p>According to Scylla, the SMS Bandits made a number of operational security (or &#8220;opsec&#8221;) mistakes that made it relatively easy to find out who they were in real life, but the technical side SMS Bandits&#8217; operation was rather advanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were launching fairly high-volume smishing campaigns from SMS gateways, but overall their opsec was fairly lousy,&#8221; Angus said. &#8220;But on the telecom front they were using fairly sophisticated tactics.&#8221;</p>

<p>For example, the SMS Bandits automated systems to check whether the phone number list provided by their customers was indeed tied to actual mobile numbers, and not landlines that might tip off telecommunications companies about mass spam campaigns.</p>
<p>&#8220;The telcos are monitoring for malicious SMS messages on a number of fronts,&#8221; Angus said. &#8220;One way to tip off an SMS gateway or wireless provider is to start blasting text messages to phone numbers that can&#8217;t receive them.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/u-k-arrest-in-sms-bandits-phishing-service/#more-51747" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The unprecedented volume of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=unemployment+insurance&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unemployment insurance fraud witnessed in 2020</a> hasn&#8217;t abated, although news coverage of the issue has largely been pushed off the front pages by other events. But the ID theft problem is coming to the fore once again: Countless Americans will soon be receiving notices from state regulators saying they owe thousands of dollars in taxes on benefits they never received last year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-25751" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/taxfraud.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="252" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/taxfraud.jpg 693w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/taxfraud-150x150.jpg 150w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/taxfraud-285x285.jpg 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/taxfraud-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" />One state&#8217;s experience offers a window into the potential scope of the problem. Hackers, identity thieves and overseas criminal rings stole over $11 billion in unemployment benefits from California last year, or roughly 10 percent of all such claims the state paid out in 2020, the state&#8217;s labor secretary <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-bdb79d54d86c3758650fa4f7163cebb2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told reporters this week</a>. Another 17 percent of claims &#8212; nearly $20 billion more &#8211; are suspected fraud.</p>
<p>California&#8217;s experience is tracked at a somewhat smaller scale in dozens of other states, where chronically underfunded and technologically outdated unemployment insurance systems were caught flat-footed by an avalanche of fraudulent claims. The scammers typically use stolen identity data to claim benefits, and then have the funds credited to an online account that they control.</p>
<p>States are required to send out 1099-G forms reporting taxable income by Jan. 31, and under federal law unemployment benefits are considered taxable income. Unfortunately, many states have not reconciled their forms with confirmed incidences of fraudulent unemployment insurance claims, meaning many people are being told they owe a great deal more in taxes than they actually do.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-offers-guidance-to-taxpayers-on-identity-theft-involving-unemployment-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a notice posted Jan. 28</a>, the <strong>U.S. Internal Revenue Service</strong> urged taxpayers who receive forms 1099-G for unemployment benefits they didn&#8217;t actually get because of ID theft to contact their appropriate state agency and request a corrected form.</p>
<p>But the IRS&#8217;s advice ignores two rather inconvenient realities. The first is that the same 1099-G forms which states are sending to their citizens also are reported to the IRS &#8212; typically at the same time the notices are mailed to residents. The other is that many state agencies are completely overwhelmed right now.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Fava</strong>, a certified public accountant in Michigan, told KrebsOnSecurity two of his clients have received 1099-G forms from Michigan regarding thousands of dollars in unemployment payments that they had neither requested nor received.</p>
<p>Fava said Michigan recently stood up a website where victims of unemployment insurance fraud who&#8217;ve received incorrect 1099-Gs can report it, but said he&#8217;s not confident the state will issue corrected notices before the April 15 tax filing deadline.</p>
<p>&#8220;In both cases, the recipients contacted the state but couldn&#8217;t get any help,&#8221; Fava said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not getting a lot of traction in resolving this issue. But the fact that they&#8217;ve now created a web page where people can input information about receiving these tells you they have to know how prevalent this is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fava said for now he&#8217;s advising his clients who are dealing with this problem to acknowledge the amount of fraudulent income on their federal tax returns, but also to subtract an equal amount on the return and note that the income reported by the state was due to fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;That way, things can be consistent with what the IRS already knows,&#8221; Fava said. &#8220;Not to acknowledge an issue like this on a federal return is just asking for a notice from the IRS.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Taxpayer Advocate Service</strong>, an <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-advocate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent office</a> of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that champions taxpayer advocacy issues, said it recently became aware that some taxpayers are receiving 1099-Gs that include reported income due to unemployment insurance identity theft. The office said it is hearing about a lot of such issues in Ohio particularly, but that the problem is happening nationally. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/the-taxman-cometh-for-id-theft-victims/#more-53733" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>U.S. and Bulgarian authorities this week seized the darkweb site used by the <strong>NetWalker</strong> ransomware cybercrime group to publish data stolen from its victims. In connection with the seizure, a Canadian national suspected of extorting more than $27 million through the spreading of NetWalker was charged in a Florida court.</p>
<div id="attachment_54151" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54151" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-54151" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/netwalker.png" alt="" width="594" height="378" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/netwalker.png 1321w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/netwalker-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /><p id="caption-attachment-54151" class="wp-caption-text">The victim shaming site maintained by the NetWalker ransomware group, after being seized by authorities this week.</p></div>
<p>NetWalker is a ransomware-as-a-service crimeware product in which affiliates rent access to the continuously updated malware code in exchange for a percentage of any funds extorted from victims. The crooks behind NetWalker used the now-seized website to publish personal and proprietary data stolen from their prey, as part of a public pressure campaign to convince victims to pay up.</p>
<p>NetWalker has been among the most rapacious ransomware strains, hitting at least 305 victims from 27 countries &#8212; the majority in the United States, according to Chainalysis, a company that tracks the flow virtual currency payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chainalysis has traced more than $46 million worth of funds in NetWalker ransoms since it first came on the scene in August 2019,&#8221; the company said in <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/netwalker-ransomware-disruption-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a> detailing its assistance with the investigation. &#8220;It picked up steam in mid-2020, growing the average ransom to $65,000 last year, up from $18,800 in 2019.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_54152" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54152" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-54152" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nw-ca.png" alt="" width="597" height="359" /><p id="caption-attachment-54152" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Chainalysis</p></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-launches-global-action-against-netwalker-ransomware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> on the seizure, the Justice Department said the NetWalker ransomware has impacted numerous victims, including companies, municipalities, hospitals, law enforcement, emergency services, school districts, colleges, and universities. For example, the University of California, San Francisco <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417911/update-it-security-incident-ucsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid $1.14 million last summer</a> in exchange for a digital key needed to unlock files encrypted by the ransomware.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attacks have specifically targeted the healthcare sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking advantage of the global crisis to extort victims,&#8221; the DOJ said.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors say one of NetWalker&#8217;s top affiliates was <strong>Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins</strong>, of Gatineau, in Ottawa, Canada. An indictment unsealed today in Florida alleges Vachon-Desjardins obtained at least $27.6 million from the scheme.</p>
<p>The DOJ&#8217;s media advisory doesn&#8217;t mention the defendant&#8217;s age, but <a href="https://www.ledroit.com/archives/le-gardien-dune-piece-secrete-au-cachot-7d524338f3e3e1afafe0ffa30099572a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2015 report</a> in the Gatineau local news website ledroit.com suggests this may not be his first offense. According to the story, a then-27-year-old Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins was sentenced to more than three years in prison for drug trafficking: He was reportedly found in possession of more than 50,000 methamphetamine tablets. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/arrest-seizures-tied-to-netwalker-ransomware/#more-54149" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Authorities across Europe on Tuesday said they&#8217;d seized control over <strong>Emotet</strong>, a prolific malware strain and cybercrime-as-service operation. Investigators say the action could help quarantine more than a million <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> systems currently compromised with malware tied to Emotet infections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-54133" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/emo-graphic.png" alt="" width="592" height="403" /></p>
<p>First surfacing in 2014, Emotet began as a banking trojan, but over the years it has evolved into one of the more aggressive platforms for spreading malware that lays the groundwork for ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> published Wednesday morning on an action dubbed &#8220;<strong>Operation Ladybird</strong>,&#8221; the European police agency <strong>Europol</strong> said the investigation involved authorities in the Netherlands, Germany, United States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EMOTET infrastructure essentially acted as a primary door opener for computer systems on a global scale,&#8221; Europol said. &#8220;Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top-level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such data theft and extortion through ransomware.&#8221;</p>
<p>Experts say Emotet is a pay-per-install botnet that is used by several distinct cybercrime groups to deploy secondary malware &#8212; most notably <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ryuk&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ransomware strain Ryuk</a> and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=trickbot&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trickbot</a>, a powerful banking trojan. It propagates mainly via malicious links and attachments sent through compromised email accounts, blasting out tens of thousands of malware-laced missives daily.</p>
<p>Emotet relies on several hierarchical tiers of control servers that communicate with infected systems. Those controllers coordinate the dissemination of second-stage malware and the theft of passwords and other data, and their distributed nature is designed to make the crimeware infrastructure more difficult to dismantle or commandeer.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2021/januari/27/11-internationale-politieoperatie-ladybird-botnet-emotet-wereldwijd-ontmanteld.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate statement</a> on the malware takeover, the Dutch National police said two of the three primary servers were located in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;A software update is placed on the Dutch central servers for all infected computer systems,&#8221; the Dutch authorities wrote. &#8220;All infected computer systems will automatically retrieve the update there, after which the Emotet infection will be quarantined. Simultaneous action in all the countries concerned was necessary to be able to effectively dismantle the network and thwart any reconstruction.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/international-action-targets-emotet-crimeware/#more-54119" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Parler</strong>, the beleaguered social network advertised as a &#8220;free speech&#8221; alternative to Facebook and Twitter, has had a tough month.<strong> Apple</strong> and <strong>Google </strong>removed the Parler app from their stores, and <strong>Amazon </strong>blocked the platform from using its hosting services. Parler has since found a home in <strong>DDoS-Guard</strong>, a Russian digital infrastructure company. But now it appears DDoS-Guard is about to be relieved of more than two-thirds of the Internet address space the company leases to clients &#8212; including the Internet addresses currently occupied by Parler.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-54098" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parler2.png" alt="" width="598" height="105" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parler2.png 786w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parler2-768x135.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></p>
<p>The pending disruption for DDoS-Guard and Parler comes compliments of <strong>Ron Guilmette</strong>, a researcher who has made it something of a personal mission to de-platform conspiracy theorist and far-right groups.</p>
<p>In October, a phone call from Guilmette to an Internet provider in Oregon was all it took <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/qanon-8chan-sites-briefly-knocked-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to briefly sideline a vast network of sites</a> tied to <strong>8chan/8kun</strong> &#8212; a controversial online image board linked to several mass shootings — and <strong>QAnon</strong>, the far-right conspiracy theory which holds that a cabal of Satanic pedophiles is running a global child sex-trafficking ring and plotting against President Donald Trump. As a result, those QAnon and 8chan sites also ultimately ended up in the arms of DDoS-Guard.</p>
<p>Much like Internet infrastructure firm <strong>CloudFlare</strong>, DDoS-Guard typically doesn&#8217;t host sites directly but instead acts as a go-between to simultaneously keep the real Internet addresses of its clients confidential and to protect them from crippling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Distributed Denial-of-Service</a> (DDoS) attacks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%225039211%22%5D&amp;origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of DDoS-Guard&#8217;s employees are based in Russia</a>, but the company is actually incorporated in two other places: As &#8220;<strong>Cognitive Cloud LLP</strong>&#8221; in Scotland, and as <strong>DDoS-Guard Corp.</strong> based in Belize.  However, none of the company&#8217;s employees are listed as based in Belize, and DDoS-Guard makes no mention of the Latin American region in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ddosguad-map-768x532.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its map of global operations</a>.</p>
<p>In studying the more than 11,000 Internet addresses assigned to those two companies, Guilmette found that approximately 66 percent of them were doled out to the Belize entity by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LACNIC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LACNIC</a>, the regional Internet registry for the Latin American and Caribbean regions.</p>
<p>Suspecting that DDoS-Guard incorporated in Belize on paper just to get huge swaths of IP addresses that are supposed to be given only to entities with a physical presence in the region, Guilmette filed a complaint with the Internet registry about his suspicions back in November.</p>
<p>Guilmette said LACNIC told him it would investigate, and that any adjudication on the matter could take up to three months. But earlier this week, LACNIC published a notice on its website that it intends to revoke 8,192 IPv4 addresses from DDoS-Guard &#8212; including the Internet address currently assigned to Parler[.]com.</p>
<div id="attachment_54092" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lacnic-revocation.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54092" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54092" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lacnic-revocation.png" alt="" width="595" height="389" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lacnic-revocation.png 785w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lacnic-revocation-768x502.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-54092" class="wp-caption-text">A notice of revocation posted by LACNIC.</p></div>
<p>LACNIC has not yet responded to requests for comment. The notice on its site says the Internet addresses are set to be revoked on Feb. 24.</p>
<p>DDoS-Guard CEO <strong>Evgeniy Marchenko</strong> maintains the company has done nothing wrong, and that DDoS-Guard does indeed have a presence in Belize.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were used strongly according [to] all LACNIC policies by [a] company legally substituted in LACNIC region,&#8221; Marchenko said in an email to KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;There is nothing illegal or extremist. We have employers and representatives in different countries around the world because we are global service. And Latin America region is not an exception.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/ddos-guard-to-forfeit-internet-space-occupied-by-parler/#more-54087" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A hacker serving a 20-year sentence for stealing personal data on 1,300 U.S. military and government employees and giving it to an Islamic State hacker group in 2015 has been charged once again with fraud and identity theft. The new charges have derailed plans to deport him under compassionate release because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Ardit Ferizi</strong>, a 25-year-old citizen of Kosovo, was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hacking-islamic-state-group-coronavirus-pandemic-da790d7b9a4f677b5dc74f376e3e66b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to be sent home earlier this month</a> after a federal judge signed an order commuting his sentence to time served. The release was granted in part due to Ferizi&#8217;s 2018 diagnosis of asthma, as well as a COVID outbreak at the facility where he was housed in 2020.</p>
<p>But while Ferizi was in quarantine awaiting deportation the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/press-release/file/1352911/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsealed new charges against him</a>, saying he&#8217;d conspired from prison with associates on the outside to access stolen data and launder the bitcoin proceeds of his previous crimes.</p>
<p>In the years leading up to his arrest, Ferizi was the administrator of a cybercrime forum called <strong>Pentagon Crew</strong>. He also served as the leader of an ethnic Albanian group of hackers from Kosovo known as Kosova Hacker&#8217;s Security (KHS), which focused on compromising government and private websites in Israel, Serbia, Greece, Ukraine and the United States.</p>
<div id="attachment_54073" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pentagoncrew.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54073" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54073 " src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pentagoncrew.png" alt="" width="599" height="234" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pentagoncrew.png 1142w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pentagoncrew-768x300.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-54073" class="wp-caption-text">The Pentagon Crew forum founded by Ferizi.</p></div>
<p>In December 2015, Ferizi was apprehended in Malaysia and extradited to the United States. In January 2016, Ferizi pleaded guilty to providing material support to a terrorist group and to unauthorized access. He admitted to hacking a U.S.-based e-commerce company, stealing personal and financial data on 1,300 government employees, and providing the data to an Islamic State hacking group.</p>
<p>Ferizi gave the purloined data to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junaid_Hussain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Junaid &#8220;Trick&#8221; Hussain</a>, a 21-year-old hacker and recruiter for ISIS who published it in August 2015 as part of a directive that ISIS supporters kill the named U.S. military members and government employees. Later that month, Hussain was reportedly killed by a drone strike in Syria. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/new-charges-derail-covid-release-for-hacker-who-aided-isis/#more-54044" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Joker&#8217;s Stash</strong>, by some accounts the largest underground shop for selling stolen credit card and identity data, says it&#8217;s closing up shop effective mid-February 2021. The announcement came on the heels of a turbulent year for the major cybercrime store, and just weeks after U.S. and European authorities seized a number of its servers.</p>
<div id="attachment_54048" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54048" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-54048" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/joker-goodbye.png" alt="" width="595" height="627" /><p id="caption-attachment-54048" class="wp-caption-text">A farewell message posted by Joker&#8217;s Stash admin on Jan. 15, 2021.</p></div>
<p>The Russian and English language carding store first opened in October 2014, and quickly became a major source of &#8220;dumps&#8221; &#8212; information stolen from compromised payment cards that thieves can buy and use to create physical counterfeit copies of the cards.</p>
<p>But 2020 turned out to be a tough year for Joker&#8217;s Stash. As cyber intelligence firm <a href="https://intel471.com/blog/jokers-stash-closed-february-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel 471</a> notes, the curator of the store announced in October that he&#8217;d contracted COVID-19, spending a week in the hospital. Around that time, Intel 471 says many of Joker&#8217;s loyal customers started complaining that the shop&#8217;s payment card data quality was increasingly poor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The condition impacted the site’s forums, inventory replenishments and other operations,&#8221; Intel 471 said.</p>
<div id="attachment_54047" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/joker-covid.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54047" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54047" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/joker-covid.png" alt="" width="599" height="304" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/joker-covid.png 1236w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/joker-covid-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-54047" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Gemini Advisory</p></div>
<p>That COVID diagnosis may have affected the shop owner&#8217;s ability to maintain fresh and valid inventory on his site. <a href="https://www.geminiadvisory.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini Advisory</a>, a New York City-based company that monitors underground carding shops, tracked a &#8220;severe decline&#8221; in the volume of compromised payment card accounts for sale on Joker&#8217;s Stash over the past six months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joker&#8217;s Stash has received numerous user complaints alleging that card data validity is low, which even prompted the administrator to upload proof of validity through a card-testing service,&#8221; Gemini wrote in <a href="https://geminiadvisory.io/jokers-stash-shuts-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a> about the planned shutdown.</p>
<div id="attachment_54050" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/js-dumpsdecline.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54050" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-54050" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/js-dumpsdecline.png" alt="" width="597" height="356" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/js-dumpsdecline.png 1387w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/js-dumpsdecline-768x458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-54050" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Gemini Advisory</p></div>
<p>Then on Dec. 16, 2020, several of Joker&#8217;s long-held domains began <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=joker%27s+stash+briankrebs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">displaying notices</a> that the sites had been seized by the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> and <strong>Interpol</strong>. The crime shop quickly recovered, moving to new infrastructure and assuring the underground community that it would continue to operate normally.</p>
<p>Gemini estimates that Joker&#8217;s Stash generated more than a billion dollars in revenue over the past several years. Much of that revenue came from high-profile breaches, including tens of millions of payment card records stolen from major merchants including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/data-breach-saks-lord-taylor-compromises-customer-payment-data-n861856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord and Taylor</a>, <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/bebe-stores-confirms-credit-card-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bebe Stores</a>, <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=hilton+breach&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hilton Hotels</a>, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/4-years-after-target-the-little-guy-is-the-target/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason’s Deli</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/whole-foods-suffers-data-breach-in-some-stores.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whole Foods</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chipotle-cyber/chipotle-says-hackers-hit-most-restaurants-in-data-breach-idUSKBN18M2BY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chipotle</a>, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/01/wawa-breach-may-have-compromised-more-than-30-million-payment-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wawa</a>, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-sonic-drive-in-may-have-impacted-millions-of-credit-debit-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic Drive-In</a>, the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/breach-at-hy-vee-supermarket-chain-tied-to-sale-of-5m-stolen-credit-debit-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hy-Vee supermarket chain</a>, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/a-month-after-2-million-customer-cards-sold-online-buca-di-beppo-parent-admits-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buca Di Beppo</a>, and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/breach-at-dickeys-bbq-smokes-3m-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dickey&#8217;s BBQ</a>.</p>
<p>Joker&#8217;s Stash routinely teased big breaches days or weeks in advance of selling payment card records stolen from those companies, and periodically linked to this site and other media outlets as proof of his shop&#8217;s prowess and authenticity.</p>
<p>Like many other top cybercrime bazaars, Joker&#8217;s Stash was a frequent target of phishers looking to rip off unwary or unsophisticated thieves. In 2018, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/will-the-real-jokers-stash-come-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed a vast network of fake Joker&#8217;s Stash sites</a> set up to steal login credentials and bitcoin. The phony sites all traced back to the owners of a Pakistani web site design firm. Many of those fake sites are still active (e.g. jokersstash[.]su).  <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/jokers-stash-carding-market-to-call-it-quits/#more-54041" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released updates to plug more than 80 security holes in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and other software, including one that is actively being exploited and another which was disclosed prior to today. Ten of the flaws earned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; rating, meaning they could be exploited by malware or miscreants to seize remote control over unpatched systems with little or no interaction from Windows users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-52647" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png" alt="" width="599" height="440" /></p>
<p>Most concerning of this month&#8217;s batch is probably a critical bug (<a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2021-1647</a>) in Microsoft&#8217;s default anti-malware suite &#8212; <strong>Windows Defender</strong> &#8212; that is seeing active exploitation. Microsoft recently stopped providing a great deal of detail in their vulnerability advisories, so it&#8217;s not entirely clear how this is being exploited.</p>
<p>But <strong>Kevin Breen</strong>, director of research at <strong>Immersive Labs</strong>, says depending on the vector the flaw could be trivial to exploit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be as simple as sending a file,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The user doesn&#8217;t need to interact with anything, as Defender will access it as soon as it is placed on the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, this bug is probably already patched by Microsoft on end-user systems, as the company continuously updates Defender outside of the normal monthly patch cycle.</p>
<p>Breen called attention to another critical vulnerability this month &#8212; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2020-1660</a> &#8212; which is a remote code execution flaw in nearly every version of Windows that earned a <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVSS score</a> of 8.8 (10 is the most dangerous).</p>
<p>&#8220;They classify this vulnerability as &#8216;low&#8217; in complexity, meaning an attack could be easy to reproduce,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;However, they also note that it’s &#8216;less likely&#8217; to be exploited, which seems counterintuitive. Without full context of this vulnerability, we have to rely on Microsoft to make the decision for us.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/microsoft-patch-tuesday-january-2021-edition/#more-54025" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>New research into the malware that set the stage for the megabreach at IT vendor <strong>SolarWinds</strong> shows the perpetrators spent months inside the company&#8217;s software development labs honing their attack before inserting malicious code into updates that SolarWinds then shipped to thousands of customers. More worrisome, the research suggests the insidious methods used by the intruders to subvert the company&#8217;s software development pipeline could be repurposed against many other major software providers.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a> published Jan. 11, SolarWinds said the attackers first compromised its development environment on Sept. 4, 2019. Soon after, the attackers began testing code designed to surreptitiously inject backdoors into <strong>Orion</strong>, a suite of tools used by many Fortune 500 firms and a broad swath of the federal government to manage their internal networks.</p>
<div id="attachment_54013" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54013" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-54013" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sw-timeline.png" alt="" width="598" height="327" /><p id="caption-attachment-54013" class="wp-caption-text">Image: SolarWinds.</p></div>
<p>According to SolarWinds and <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a technical analysis</a> from <strong>CrowdStrike</strong>, the intruders were trying to work out whether their &#8220;<strong>Sunspot</strong>&#8221; malware &#8212; designed specifically for use in undermining SolarWinds&#8217; software development process &#8212; could successfully insert their malicious &#8220;<strong>Sunburst</strong>&#8221; backdoor into Orion products without tripping any alarms or alerting Orion developers.</p>
<p>In October 2019, SolarWinds pushed an update to their Orion customers that contained the modified test code. By February 2020, the intruders had used Sunspot to inject the Sunburst backdoor into the Orion source code, which was then digitally signed by the company and propagated to customers via SolarWinds&#8217; software update process.</p>
<p>Crowdstrike said Sunspot was written to be able to detect when it was installed on a SolarWinds developer system, and to lie in wait until specific Orion source code files were accessed by developers. This allowed the intruders to &#8220;replace source code files during the build process, before compilation,&#8221; Crowdstrike wrote.</p>
<p>The attackers also included safeguards to prevent the backdoor code lines from appearing in Orion software build logs, and checks to ensure that such tampering wouldn&#8217;t cause build errors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design of SUNSPOT suggests [the malware] developers invested a lot of effort to ensure the code was properly inserted and remained undetected, and prioritized operational security to avoid revealing their presence in the build environment to SolarWinds developers,&#8221; CrowdStrike wrote.</p>
<p>A third malware strain &#8212; dubbed &#8220;<strong>Teardrop</strong>&#8221; by <strong>FireEye</strong>, the company that <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first disclosed the SolarWinds attack in December</a> &#8212; was installed via the backdoored Orion updates on networks that the SolarWinds attackers wanted to plunder more deeply.</p>
<p>So far, the Teardrop malware has been found on several government networks, including the Commerce, Energy and Treasury departments, the Department of Justice and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/sealed-u-s-court-records-exposed-in-solarwinds-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts</a>.</p>
<p>SolarWinds emphasized that while the Sunspot code was specifically designed to compromise the integrity of its software development process, that same process is likely common across the software industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our concern is that right now similar processes may exist in software development environments at other companies throughout the world,&#8221; said SolarWinds <strong>CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna</strong>. &#8220;The severity and complexity of this attack has taught us that more effectively combatting similar attacks in the future will require an industry-wide approach as well as public-private partnerships that leverage the skills, insight, knowledge, and resources of all constituents.&#8221;</p>
