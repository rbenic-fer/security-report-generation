												<p>The <strong>FBI</strong> <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-network-disruption-at-colonial-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> this week that a relatively new ransomware group known as <strong>DarkSide</strong> is responsible for an attack that caused <strong>Colonial Pipeline</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/politics/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to shut down 5,550 miles of pipe</a>, stranding countless barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel on the Gulf Coast. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the DarkSide cybercrime gang, as seen through their negotiations with a recent U.S. victim that earns $15 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<div id="attachment_55553" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55553" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-55553" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/colonialpipe.png" alt="" width="733" height="569" /><p id="caption-attachment-55553" class="wp-caption-text">Colonial Pipeline has shut down 5,500 miles of fuel pipe in response to a ransomware incident. Image: colpipe.com</p></div>
<p>New York City-based cyber intelligence firm <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flashpoint</a> said its analysts assess with a moderate-strong degree of confidence that the attack was not intended to damage national infrastructure and was simply associated with a target which had the finances to support a large payment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would be consistent with DarkSide’s earlier activities, which included several &#8216;big game hunting&#8217; attacks, whereby attackers target an organization that likely possesses the financial means to pay the ransom demanded by the attackers,&#8221; Flashpoint observed.</p>
<p>In response to public attention to the Colonial Pipeline attack, the DarkSide group sought to play down fears about widespread infrastructure attacks going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for other our motives [sic],&#8221; reads an update to the DarkSide Leaks blog. &#8220;Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society. From today we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>First surfacing on Russian language hacking forums in August 2020, DarkSide is a ransomware-as-a-service platform that vetted cybercriminals can use to infect companies with ransomware and carry out negotiations and payments with victims. DarkSide says it targets only big companies, and forbids affiliates from dropping ransomware on organizations in several industries, including healthcare, funeral services, education, public sector and non-profits.</p>
<p>Like other ransomware platforms, DarkSide adheres to the current badguy best practice of double extortion, which involves demanding separate sums for both a digital key needed to unlock any files and servers, and a separate ransom in exchange for a promise to destroy any data stolen from the victim.</p>
<p>At its launch, DarkSide sought to woo affiliates from competing ransomware programs by advertising a victim data leak site that gets &#8220;stable visits and media coverage,&#8221; as well as the ability to publish victim data by stages. Under the &#8220;Why choose us?&#8221; heading of the ransomware program thread, the admin answers:</p>
<div id="attachment_55536" style="width: 963px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55536" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-55536" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-start.png" alt="" width="953" height="712" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-start.png 953w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-start-768x574.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-start-782x584.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 953px) 100vw, 953px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55536" class="wp-caption-text">An advertisement for the DarkSide ransomware group.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;High trust level of our targets. They pay us and know that they&#8217;re going to receive decryption tools. They also know that we download data. A lot of data. That&#8217;s why the percent of our victims who pay the ransom is so high and it takes so little time to negotiate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In late March, DarkSide introduced a &#8220;call service&#8221; innovation that was integrated into the affiliate’s management panel, which enabled the affiliates to arrange calls pressuring victims into paying ransoms directly from the management panel.</p>
<p>In mid-April the ransomware program announced new capability for affiliates to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets whenever added pressure is needed during ransom negotiations.</p>
<p>DarkSide also has advertised a willingness to sell information about upcoming victims before their stolen information is published on the DarkSide victim shaming blog, so that enterprising investment scammers can short the company&#8217;s stock in advance of the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now our team and partners encrypt many companies that are trading on NASDAQ and other stock exchanges,&#8221; DarkSide explains. &#8220;If the company refuses to pay, we are ready to provide information before the publication, so that it would be possible to earn in the reduction price of shares. Write to us in &#8216;Contact Us&#8217; and we will provide you with detailed information.&#8221;</p>
<p>DarkSide also started recruiting new affiliates again last month &#8212; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/amid-an-embarrassment-of-riches-ransom-gangs-increasingly-outsource-their-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mainly seeking network penetration testers who can help turn a single compromised computer into a full-on data breach and ransomware incident.</a></p>
<div id="attachment_55546" style="width: 777px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dark-pentesters.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55546" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-55546 " src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dark-pentesters.png" alt="" width="767" height="165" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dark-pentesters.png 1092w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dark-pentesters-768x165.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dark-pentesters-782x168.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55546" class="wp-caption-text">Portions of a DarkSide recruitment message, translated from Russian. Image: Intel 471.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;We have grown significantly in terms of the client base and in comparison to other projects (judging by the analysis of publicly available information), so we are ready to grow our team and a number of our affiliates in two fields,&#8221; DarkSide explained. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/darkside20.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> The advertisement</a> continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Network penetration testing. We&#8217;re looking for one person or a team. We&#8217;ll adapt you to the work environment and provide work. High profit cuts, ability to target networks that you can&#8217;t handle on your own. New experience and stable income. When you use our product and the ransom is paid, we guarantee fair distribution of the funds. A panel for monitoring results for your target. We only accept networks where you intend to run our payload.&#8221;</p>
<p>DarkSide has shown itself to be fairly ruthless with victim companies that have deep pockets, but they can be reasoned with. Cybersecurity intelligence firm <a href="https://www.intel471.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel 471</a> observed a negotiation between the DarkSide crew and a $15 billion U.S. victim company that was hit with a $30 million ransom demand in January 2021, and in this incident the victim&#8217;s efforts at negotiating a lower payment ultimately reduce the ransom demand by almost two-thirds.</p>
<div id="attachment_55545" style="width: 761px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55545" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-55545" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/darkside-lock.png" alt="" width="751" height="530" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/darkside-lock.png 775w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/darkside-lock-768x542.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/darkside-lock-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55545" class="wp-caption-text">The DarkSide ransomware note.</p></div>
<p>The first exchange between DarkSide and the victim involved the usual back-and-forth establishing of trust, wherein the victim asks for assurances that stolen data will be deleted after payment.</p>
<div id="attachment_55544" style="width: 777px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55544" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-55544" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-1.png" alt="" width="767" height="492" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-1.png 809w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-1-768x493.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ds-1-782x502.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55544" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Intel 471.</p></div>
<p>When the victim counter-offered to pay just $2.25 million, DarkSide responded with a lengthy, derisive reply, ultimately agreeing to lower the ransom demand to $28.7 million.</p>

<p>&#8220;The timer it [sic] ticking and in in next 8 hours your price tag will go up to $60 million,&#8221; the crooks replied. &#8220;So, you this are your options first take our generous offer and pay to us $28,750 million US or invest some monies in quantum computing to expedite a decryption process.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/a-closer-look-at-the-darkside-ransomware-gang/#more-55529" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>How much is your payroll data worth? Probably a lot more than you think. One financial startup that&#8217;s targeting the gig worker market is offering up to $500 to anyone willing to hand over the payroll account username and password given to them by their employer, plus a regular payment for each month afterwards in which those credentials still work.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_55470" style="width: 774px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55470" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-55470" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/workersunite.png" alt="" width="764" height="327" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/workersunite.png 1835w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/workersunite-768x329.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/workersunite-1536x657.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/workersunite-782x335.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55470" class="wp-caption-text">This ad, from workplaceunited[.]com, promised up to $500 for people who provided their payroll passwords, plus $25 a month for each month those credentials kept working.</p></div>New York-based <strong>Argyle.com</strong> says it&#8217;s building a platform where people who work multiple jobs and/or side hustles can improve their credit and employment options by pooling all of their gig work data in one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers’ access to financial security and upward mobility is dependent on their access to and control over their own employment records and how easily they can share those records with financial institutions,&#8221; Argyle explained in <a href="https://argyle.com/blog/democratizing-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a May 3 blog post</a>. &#8220;We enable access to a dataset that, for too long, has gone unstandardized, unregulated, and controlled by corporations instead of consumers, contributing to system-wide inequalities.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_55508" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/argyle-howworks.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55508" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-55508" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/argyle-howworks.png" alt="" width="780" height="487" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/argyle-howworks.png 1348w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/argyle-howworks-768x479.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/argyle-howworks-782x488.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55508" class="wp-caption-text">Argyle&#8217;s app flow. Image: Argyle.com.</p></div>
<p>In that sense, Argyle is making a play for a discrete chunk of a much larger employment data market dominated by the major credit bureaus, which have been hoovering up and selling access to employment data for years.</p>
<p>The 800-lb. gorilla there is <strong>Equifax</strong>, whose <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/the-work-number/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Work Number product</a> has for years purchased employment data flows from some of the world&#8217;s largest companies (employees consent to this sharing as part of their employment contract, and The Work Number <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/equifax-breach-fallout-your-salary-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes it fairly easy for anyone to learn how much you earn</a>).</p>
<p>The Work Number is designed to provide automated employment and income verification for prospective employers, and tens of thousands of companies report employee salary data to it. It also allows anyone whose employer uses the service to provide proof of their income when purchasing a home or applying for a loan.</p>
<p>On its blog, Argyle imagines a world in which companies choose to integrate its application platform interface (API) and share their employee payroll data. At the same time, the company appears to be part of an effort in which non-salaried workers are prompted to repay their erstwhile employers&#8217; trust by selling payroll credentials.</p>
<p>If Argyle is worried these two goals might somehow conflict, that is not obvious by looking at some of its direct-to-consumer efforts.</p>
<p>The website pictured below prompts visitors to &#8220;connect payroll,&#8221; and those who proceed agree to have their payroll data shared with a company called <a href="https://www.earnin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earnin</a>, a mobile payday loan app that lets users get an advance on their upcoming paycheck.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55478" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/earnin1.png" alt="" width="564" height="284" /></p>
<p>Clicking &#8220;Connect Payroll&#8221; brings up a list of payroll login pages for brand name companies, including <strong>Walmart</strong>, <strong>Starbucks</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Uber</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, etc., with a search feature that reveals login pages for everyone from the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI) to the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> and <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> (FTC).</p>

<p>Drilling down into individual companies listed here produces a username and password form that in some cases is modified to request an employee identifier other than a username, such as a employee ID, associate or partner number instead. Here&#8217;s the login page for Starbucks employees:</p>

<p>The site pictured above actively checks if any submitted credentials are working, by submitting them directly to the employer in question. <a href="https://status.argyle.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Argyle status page</a> indicates the system&#8217;s &#8220;data connection status&#8221; to countless employers.</p>
<p>Some of you may be thinking, &#8220;How many of us actually know or have our payroll passwords?&#8221; According to Argyle, plenty of people do.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Argyle, we are intimately familiar with how likely someone is to know the password for their employment account or payroll system, because we&#8217;ve seen hundreds of thousands of users successfully (and unsuccessfully) provide their credentials,&#8221; Argyle&#8217;s <strong>Billy Mardsen</strong> <a href="https://argyle.com/blog/payroll-passwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on Apr. 1</a>. &#8220;We closely monitor their success rate—what we call <i>conversion</i>—because it drives the performance of the products and applications that our clients build on top of Argyle.&#8221;</p>

												<p><strong>John Bernard</strong>, a pseudonym used by a convicted thief and con artist named <strong>John Clifton Davies</strong> who’s fleeced dozens of technology startups out of an estimated $30 million, appears to have reinvented himself again after being exposed in a recent investigative series published here. Sources tell KrebsOnSecurity that Davies/Bernard is now posing as <strong>John Cavendish</strong> and head of a new &#8220;private office&#8221; called <strong>Hempton Business Management LLP</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-52977" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/investmoney.png" alt="" width="767" height="546" /></p>
<p>John Davies is a U.K. man who absconded from justice before being convicted on multiple counts of fraud in 2015. Prior to his conviction, Davies served 16 months in jail before <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-21850549" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being cleared of murdering his wife on their honeymoon in India</a>.</p>
<p>Davies&#8217; fraud convictions stemmed from a series of U.K. companies he set up supposedly to help troubled companies reorganize their debt and turn things around. Davies ended up looting what little money his clients had left and spending it on lavish cars, home furnishings, vacations and luxury watches.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=john+bernard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a three-part series published last year</a>, KrebsOnSecurity exposed how Davies &#8212; wanted by authorities in the U.K. &#8212; had fled the country, taken on the surname Bernard, remarried, and moved to his new (and fourth) wife&#8217;s hometown in Ukraine.</p>
<div id="attachment_53032" style="width: 771px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53032" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-53032" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bernard-sbs.png" alt="" width="761" height="403" /><p id="caption-attachment-53032" class="wp-caption-text">The scam artist John Bernard (left) in a recent Zoom call, and a photo of John Clifton Davies from 2015.</p></div>
<p>After eluding justice in the U.K., Davies reinvented himself as <strong>The Private Office of John Bernard</strong>, pretending to be a billionaire Swiss investor who made his fortunes in the dot-com boom 20 years ago and who was seeking private equity investment opportunities.</p>
<p>In case after case, Bernard would promise to invest millions in hi-tech startups, only to insist that companies pay tens of thousands of dollars worth of due diligence fees up front. However, the due diligence company he insisted on using — another Swiss firm called <strong>Inside Knowledge</strong> — also was secretly owned by Bernard, who would invariably pull out of the deal after receiving the due diligence money.</p>
<p>Bernard found a constant stream of new marks by offering extraordinarily generous finders fees to investment brokers who could introduce him to companies seeking an infusion of cash. Inside Knowledge and The Private Office both closed up shop not long after their exploits were detailed here late last year.</p>
<p>But it appears Davies has just assumed a new name. KrebsOnSecurity recently heard from an investment broker who previously represented multiple clients that got fleeced by Mr. Bernard/Davies over the years. That broker said he was blown away to hear Davies&#8217; unique British accent on a recent call with a client that had been in investment talks with a Northern Ireland firm called <strong>Hempton Business Management</strong>.</p>
<p>This time, the source said, Davies was introduced by handlers on the call as <strong>John Cavendish</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just sat in on a call and John’s voice is unmistakable,&#8221; said the broker, who asked to remain anonymous. &#8220;He stumbled on the beginning of the call trying to remember which last name he was supposed to use. Immediately they go back to the standard script about the types of deals they are looking for. They want to be minority investors in private transactions and they are industry agnostic.  Their deal sizes are investments in the $5-20 million range, they prefer to not use big 4 firms for due diligence, and they have some smaller firms they use which are better suited for smaller investment deals.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hempton.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-55304" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hempton.png" alt="" width="762" height="330" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hempton.png 1433w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hempton-768x332.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hempton-782x338.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></a></p>
<p>The source forwarded me some correspondence from Hempton Business Management, and I noticed it was sent from a <strong>Mariya Kulykova</strong>. This is interesting because Mr. Bernard&#8217;s personal assistant in Ukraine was a <strong>Mariya Kulikova</strong> (Ms. Kulikova deleted Bernard&#8217;s former companies from her LinkedIn profile shortly after last year&#8217;s series).</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s website says Hempton has been around since 2017, but the domain name was only registered in late November 2020. There is no information about who runs or owns the company on its site.</p>
<p><strong> Hemptonllp[.]com</strong> was registered via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gandi</a>, the same French registrar John Bernard/Davies has used over the years with his dozens of phantom companies.</p>
<p>Hempton Business Management&#8217;s only presence on LinkedIn appears to be a help wanted ad from a few weeks ago, for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/marketing-specialist-at-hempton-business-management-llp-2477130915/?originalSubdomain=ua" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a marketing position at an office in Kyiv, Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>In response to an emailed request for comment on the apparent connections, Mr. Cavendish forwarded the message to a <strong>James Donohoe</strong>, who replied that he was the owner of Hempton. Donohoe said the domain was new because the company recently re-branded, although he declined to discuss the matter further.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sounds like an accusation of a big fraud?,&#8221; Donohoe wrote. &#8220;I have never had any dealings with a John Clifton Davies or John Bernard. You really are a cheeky little bugger aren&#8217;t you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Donohoe did not respond to further requests for comment. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/investment-scammer-john-davies-reinvents-himself/#more-55201" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Phishers targeting <strong>Microsoft Office 365</strong> users increasingly are turning to specialized links that take users to their organization&#8217;s own email login page. After a user logs in, the link prompts them to install a malicious but innocuously-named app that gives the attacker persistent, password-free access to any of the user&#8217;s emails and files, both of which are then plundered to launch malware and phishing scams against others.</p>
<p>These attacks begin with an emailed link that when clicked loads not a phishing site but the user&#8217;s actual Office 365 login page &#8212; whether that be at microsoft.com or their employer&#8217;s domain. After logging in, the user might see a prompt that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55445" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/permissionsrequested.png" alt="" width="537" height="638" /></p>
<p>These malicious apps allow attackers to bypass multi-factor authentication, because they are approved by the user after that user has already logged in. Also, the apps will persist in a user&#8217;s Office 365 account indefinitely until removed, and will survive even after an account password reset.</p>
<p>This week, messaging security vendor <strong>Proofpoint</strong> <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/email-and-cloud-threats/how-attackers-use-compromised-accounts-create-and-distribute-malicious" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published some new data</a> on the rise of these malicious Office 365 apps, noting that a high percentage of Office users will fall for this scheme [full disclosure: Proofpoint is an advertiser on this website].</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Kalember</strong>, Proofpoint&#8217;s executive vice president of cybersecurity strategy, said 55 percent of the company&#8217;s customers have faced these malicious app attacks at one point or another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of those who got attacked, about 22 percent &#8212; or one in five &#8212; were successfully compromised,&#8221; Kalember said.</p>
<p>Kalember said Microsoft last year sought to limit the spread of these malicious Office apps by creating an app publisher verification system, which requires the publisher to be a valid Microsoft Partner Network member.</p>
<p>That approval process is cumbersome for attackers, so they&#8217;ve devised a simple work around. &#8220;Now, they’re compromising accounts in credible tenants first,&#8221; Proofpoint explains. &#8220;Then, they&#8217;re creating, hosting and spreading cloud malware from within.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/malicious-office-365-apps-are-the-ultimate-insiders/#more-55441" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>When normal computer users fall into the nasty habit of recycling passwords, the result is most often some type of financial loss. When cybercriminals develop the same habit, it can eventually cost them their freedom.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-55426" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/moneylife.png" alt="" width="767" height="525" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/moneylife.png 988w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/moneylife-768x525.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/moneylife-782x535.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /></p>
<p>Our passwords can say a lot about us, and much of what they have to say is unflattering. In a world in which all databases &#8212; including hacker forums &#8212; are eventually compromised and leaked online, it can be tough for cybercriminals to maintain their anonymity if they&#8217;re in the habit of re-using the same unusual passwords across multiple accounts associated with different email addresses.</p>
<p>The long-running <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=breadcrumbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breadcrumbs series here</a> tracks how cybercriminals get caught, and it&#8217;s mostly through odd connections between their online and offline selves scattered across the Internet. Interestingly, one of the more common connections involves re-using or recycling passwords across multiple accounts.</p>
<p>And yes, hackers get their passwords compromised at the same rate as the rest of us. Which means when a cybercrime forum gets hacked and its user databases posted online, it is often possible to work backwards from some of the more unique passwords for each account and see where else that password was used. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/the-wages-of-password-re-use-your-money-or-your-life/#more-54793" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Some of the world&#8217;s top tech firms are backing a new industry task force focused on disrupting cybercriminal ransomware gangs by limiting their ability to get paid, and targeting the individuals and finances of the organized thieves behind these crimes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53514" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware.png" alt="" width="774" height="580" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware.png 1016w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware-768x575.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></p>
<p>In <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 81-page report</a> delivered to the Biden administration this week, top executives from <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Cisco</strong>, <strong>FireEye</strong>, <strong>McAfee</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong> and dozens of other firms joined the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> (DOJ), <strong>Europol</strong> and the <strong>U.K. National Crime Agency</strong> in calling for an international coalition to combat ransomware criminals, and for a global network of ransomware investigation hubs.</p>
<p>The Ransomware Task Force urged the White House to make finding, frustrating and apprehending ransomware crooks a priority within the U.S. intelligence community, and to designate the current scourge of digital extortion as a national security threat.</p>
<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-targeted-by-new-justice-department-task-force-11619014158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the news</a> that the DOJ was forming its own task force to deal with the &#8220;root causes&#8221; of ransomware. An internal DOJ memo reportedly &#8220;calls for developing a strategy that targets the entire criminal ecosystem around ransomware, including prosecutions, disruptions of ongoing attacks and curbs on services that support the attacks, such as online forums that advertise the sale of ransomware or hosting services that facilitate ransomware campaigns.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to security firm <a href="https://www.emsisoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emsisoft</a>, almost 2,400 U.S.-based governments, healthcare facilities and schools were victims of ransomware in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The costs of ransomware go far beyond the ransom payments themselves,&#8221; the task force report observes. &#8220;Cybercrime is typically seen as a white-collar crime, but while ransomware is profit-driven and &#8216;non-violent&#8217; in the traditional sense, that has not stopped ransomware attackers from routinely imperiling lives.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_55382" style="width: 826px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55382" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-55382" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rtf-framework.png" alt="" width="816" height="512" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rtf-framework.png 816w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rtf-framework-768x482.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rtf-framework-782x491.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55382" class="wp-caption-text">A proposed framework for a public-private operational ransomware campaign. Image: IST.</p></div>
<p>It is difficult to gauge the true cost and size of the ransomware problem because many victims never come forward to report the crimes. As such, a number of the task force&#8217;s recommendations focus on ways to encourage more victims to report the crimes to their national authorities, such as requiring victims and incident response firms who pay a ransomware demand to report the matter to law enforcement and possibly regulators at the <strong>U.S. Treasury Department</strong>.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/ransomware-victims-that-pay-up-could-incur-steep-fines-from-uncle-sam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treasury issued a controversial memo</a> warning that ransomware victims who end up sending digital payments to people already being sanctioned by the U.S. government for money laundering and other illegal activities could result in hefty fines.</p>
<p><strong>Philip Reiner</strong>, CEO of the <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute for Security and Technology</a> and executive director of the industry task force, said the reporting recommendations are one of several areas where federal agencies will likely need to dedicate more employees. For example, he said, expecting victims to clear ransomware payments with the Treasury Department first assumes the agency has the staff to respond in any kind of timeframe that might be useful for a victim undergoing a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we were so dead set in putting forward comprehensive framework,&#8221; Reiner said. &#8220;That way, Department of Homeland Security can do what they need to do, the State Department, Treasury gets involved, and it all needs to be synchronized for going after the bad guys with the same alacrity.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/task-force-seeks-to-disrupt-ransomware-payments/#more-55321" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Big-three consumer credit bureau <strong>Experian</strong> just fixed a weakness with a partner website that let anyone look up the credit score of tens of millions of Americans just by supplying their name and mailing address, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Experian says it has plugged the data leak, but the researcher who reported the finding says he fears the same weakness may be present at countless other lending websites that work with the credit bureau.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55370" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/exp.png" alt="" width="760" height="399" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/exp.png 760w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/exp-267x140.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Demirkapi</a>, an independent security researcher who&#8217;s currently a sophomore at the <strong>Rochester Institute of Technology</strong>, said he discovered the data exposure while shopping around for student loan vendors online.</p>
<p>Demirkapi encountered one lender&#8217;s site that offered to check his loan eligibility by entering his name, address and date of birth. Peering at the code behind this lookup page, he was able to see it invoked an Experian <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> or API &#8212; a capability that allows lenders to automate queries for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FICO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FICO credit scores</a> from the credit bureau.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one should be able to perform an Experian credit check with only publicly available information,&#8221; Demirkapi said. &#8220;Experian should mandate non-public information for promotional inquiries, otherwise an attacker who found a single vulnerability in a vendor could easily abuse Experian&#8217;s system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Demirkapi found the Experian API could be accessed directly without any sort of authentication, and that entering all zeros in the &#8220;date of birth&#8221; field let him then pull a person&#8217;s credit score. He even built a handy command-line tool to automate the lookups, which he dubbed &#8220;Bill&#8217;s Cool Credit Score Lookup Utility.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_55376" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tool.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55376" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-55376" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tool.png" alt="" width="768" height="156" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tool.png 1132w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tool-768x156.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tool-782x159.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55376" class="wp-caption-text">Demirkapi’s Experian credit score lookup tool.</p></div>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity put that tool to the test, asking permission from a friend to have Demirkapi look up their credit score. The friend agreed and said he would pull his score from Experian (at this point I hadn&#8217;t told him that Experian was involved). The score he provided matched the score returned by Demirkapi&#8217;s lookup tool.</p>
<p>In addition to credit scores, the Experian API returns for each consumer up to four &#8220;risk factors,&#8221; indicators that might help explain why a person&#8217;s score is not higher.</p>
<p>For example, in my friend&#8217;s case Bill&#8217;s tool said his mid-700s score could be better if the proportion of balances to credit limits was lower, and if he didn&#8217;t owe so much on revolving credit accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many consumer finance company accounts,&#8221; the API concluded about my friend&#8217;s score.</p>
<p>The reason I could not test Demirkapi&#8217;s findings on my own credit score is that we have <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a security freeze on our files at the three major consumer credit reporting bureaus</a>, and a freeze blocks this particular API from pulling the information. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experian-api-exposed-credit-scores-of-most-americans/#more-55295" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In 2017, KrebsOnSecurity showed how easy it is for identity thieves to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/experian-site-can-give-anyone-your-credit-freeze-pin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undo a consumer&#8217;s request to freeze their credit file at <strong>Experian</strong></a>, one of the big three consumer credit bureaus in the United States.  Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who had his freeze thawed without authorization through Experian&#8217;s website, and it reminded me of how truly broken authentication and security remains in the credit bureau space.</p>
<div id="attachment_40829" style="width: 775px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40829" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-40829" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/experianunfreeze.png" alt="" width="765" height="675" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/experianunfreeze.png 1450w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/experianunfreeze-580x511.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/experianunfreeze-768x677.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/experianunfreeze-940x828.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /><p id="caption-attachment-40829" class="wp-caption-text">Experian&#8217;s page for retrieving someone&#8217;s credit freeze PIN requires little more information than has already been leaked by big-three bureau Equifax and a myriad other breaches.</p></div>
<p><strong>Dune Thomas</strong> is a software engineer from Sacramento, Calif. who put a freeze on his credit files last year at Experian, <strong>Equifax</strong> and <strong>TransUnion</strong> after thieves tried to open multiple new payment accounts in his name using an address in Washington state that was tied to a vacant home for sale.</p>
<p>But the crooks were persistent: Earlier this month, someone unfroze Thomas&#8217; account at Experian and promptly applied for new lines of credit in his name, again using the same Washington street address. Thomas said he only learned about the activity because he&#8217;d taken advantage of a free credit monitoring service offered by his credit card company.</p>
<p>Thomas said after several days on the phone with Experian, a company representative acknowledged that someone had used the <a href="https://www.experian.com/ncaconline/freezepin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;request your PIN&#8221; feature</a> on Experian&#8217;s site to obtain his PIN and then unfreeze his file.</p>
<p>Thomas said he and a friend both walked through the process of recovering their freeze PIN at Experian, and were surprised to find that just one of the five multiple-guess questions they were asked after entering their address, Social Security Number and date of birth had anything to do with information only the credit bureau might know.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity stepped through the same process and found similar results. The first question asked about a new mortgage I supposedly took out in 2019 (I didn&#8217;t), and the answer was none of the above. The answer to the second question also was none of the above.</p>
<p>The next two questions were useless for authentication purposes because they&#8217;d already been asked and answered; one was &#8220;which of the following is the last four digits of your SSN,&#8221; and the other was &#8220;I was born within a year or on the year of the date below.&#8221; Only one question mattered and was relevant to my credit history (it concerned the last four digits of a checking account number).</p>
<p>The best part about this lax authentication process is that <em>one can enter any email address to retrieve the PIN</em> &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t need to be tied to an existing account at Experian. Also, when the PIN is retrieved, Experian doesn&#8217;t bother notifying any other email addresses already on file for that consumer.</p>
<p>Finally, your basic consumer (read: free) account at Experian does not give users the option to enable any sort of multi-factor authentication that might help stymie some of these PIN retrieval attacks on credit freezes.</p>
<p>Unless, that is, you subscribe to Experian&#8217;s heavily-marketed and confusingly-worded &#8220;<strong>CreditLock</strong>&#8221; service, which charges between $14.99 and $24.99 a month for the ability to &#8220;lock and unlock your file easily and quickly, without delaying the application process.&#8221; CreditLock users can both enable multifactor authentication and get alerts when someone tries to access their account.</p>
<p>Thomas said he&#8217;s furious that Experian only provides added account security for consumers who pay for monthly plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Experian had the ability to give people way better protection through added authentication of some kind, but instead they don&#8217;t because they can charge $25 a month for it,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;They&#8217;re allowing this huge security gap so they can make a profit. And this has been going on for at least four years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Experian has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>When a consumer with a freeze logs in to Experian&#8217;s site, they are immediately directed to a message for one of Experian&#8217;s paid services, such as its CreditLock service. The message I saw upon logging in confirmed that while I had a freeze in place with Experian, my current &#8220;protection level&#8221; was &#8220;low&#8221; because my credit file was unlocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;When your file is unlocked, you&#8217;re more vulnerable to identity theft and fraud,&#8221; Experian warns, untruthfully. &#8220;You won&#8217;t see alerts if someone tries to access your file. Banks can check your file if you apply for credit or loans. Utility and service providers can see your credit file.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_55333" style="width: 776px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55333" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-55333" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/experianprotection.png" alt="" width="766" height="316" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/experianprotection.png 1125w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/experianprotection-768x317.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/experianprotection-782x323.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55333" class="wp-caption-text">Experian says my security is low because while I have a freeze in place, I haven&#8217;t bought into their questionable &#8220;lock service.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Sounds scary, right? The thing is &#8212; except for the part about not seeing alerts &#8212; none of the above statement is true if you already have a freeze on your file. A security freeze essentially blocks any potential creditors from being able to view your credit file, unless you affirmatively unfreeze or thaw your file beforehand. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experians-credit-freeze-security-is-still-a-joke/#more-55329" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>What was the best news you heard so far this month? Mine was learning that KrebsOnSecurity is listed as a restricted competitor by <strong>Gartner Inc.</strong> [<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSE:IT</a>] &#8212; a $4 billion technology goliath whose analyst reports can move markets and shape the IT industry.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a reader pointed my attention to the following notice from Gartner to clients who are seeking to promote Gartner reports about technology products and services:</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gartner.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-55275" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gartner.png" alt="" width="768" height="589" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gartner.png 1023w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gartner-768x589.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gartner-782x600.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>What that notice says is that KrebsOnSecurity is somehow on Gartner&#8217;s &#8220;non exhaustive list of competitors,&#8221; i.e., online venues where technology companies are not allowed to promote Gartner reports about their products and services.</p>
<p>The bulk of Gartner&#8217;s revenue comes from subscription-based IT market research. As the largest organization dedicated to the analysis of software, Gartner&#8217;s network of analysts are well connected to the technology and software industries. Some <a href="https://www.brightworkresearch.com/best-understand-gartners-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have argued</a> that Gartner is a kind of private social network, in that a significant portion of Gartner&#8217;s competitive position is based on its interaction with an extensive network of software vendors and buyers.</p>
<p>Either way, the company regularly serves as a virtual kingmaker with their trademark &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Quadrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic Quadrant</a>&#8221; designations, which rate technology vendors and industries &#8220;based on proprietary <a title="Qualitative research" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research" data-ss1618934228="1">qualitative</a> <a title="Data analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis" data-ss1618934228="1">data analysis</a> methods to demonstrate market trends, such as direction, maturity and participants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two main subjective criteria upon which Gartner bases those rankings are &#8220;the ability to execute&#8221; and &#8220;completeness of vision.&#8221; They also break companies out into categories such as &#8220;challengers,&#8221; &#8220;leaders,&#8221; &#8220;visionaries&#8221; and &#8220;niche players.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_55273" style="width: 746px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gmq.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55273" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-55273" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gmq.png" alt="" width="736" height="779" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55273" class="wp-caption-text">Gartner&#8217;s 2020 &#8220;Magic Quadrant&#8221; for companies that provide &#8220;contact center as a service&#8221; offerings.</p></div>
<p>So when Gartner issues a public report forecasting that worldwide semiconductor revenue will fall, or that worldwide public cloud revenue will grow, those reports very often move markets.</p>
<p>Being listed by Gartner as a competitor has had no discernable financial impact on KrebsOnSecurity, or on its reporting. But I find this designation both flattering and remarkable given that this site seldom promotes technological solutions. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/note-to-self-create-non-exhaustive-list-of-competitors/#more-55197" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>On Aug. 13, 2020, someone uploaded a suspected malicious file to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VirusTotal</a>, a service that scans submitted files against more than five dozen antivirus and security products. Last month, <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>FireEye</strong> identified that file as a newly-discovered fourth malware backdoor used in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=solar+winds+hack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sprawling SolarWinds supply chain hack</a>. An analysis of the malicious file and other submissions by the same VirusTotal user suggest the account that initially flagged the backdoor as suspicious belongs to IT personnel at the <strong>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</strong> (NTIA), a division of the <strong>U.S. Commerce Department</strong> that handles telecommunications and Internet policy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-55246" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ntia.png" alt="" width="588" height="584" /></p>
<p>Both Microsoft and FireEye published blog posts on Mar. 4 concerning a new backdoor found on high-value targets that were compromised by the SolarWinds attackers. FireEye refers to the backdoor as &#8220;<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/sunshuttle-second-stage-backdoor-targeting-us-based-entity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunshuttle</a>,&#8221; whereas Microsoft calls it &#8220;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoldMax</a>.&#8221; FireEye <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/sunshuttle-second-stage-backdoor-targeting-us-based-entity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> the Sunshuttle backdoor was named &#8220;<strong>Lexicon.exe</strong>,&#8221; and had the unique file signatures or &#8220;hashes&#8221; of &#8220;<strong>9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd</strong>&#8221; (MD5) and <strong>b9a2c986b6ad1eb4cfb0303baede906936fe96396f3cf490b0984a4798d741d8</strong> (SHA-1).</p>
<p>&#8220;In August 2020, a U.S.-based entity uploaded a new backdoor that we have named SUNSHUTTLE to a public malware repository,&#8221; FireEye wrote.</p>
<div id="attachment_55237" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sunshuttle-vt.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55237" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-55237" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sunshuttle-vt.png" alt="" width="768" height="485" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sunshuttle-vt.png 1187w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sunshuttle-vt-768x485.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sunshuttle-vt-782x494.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55237" class="wp-caption-text">The &#8220;Sunshuttle&#8221; or &#8220;GoldMax&#8221; backdoor, as identified by FireEye and Microsoft, respectively.

<p>A search in VirusTotal&#8217;s malware repository <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b9a2c986b6ad1eb4cfb0303baede906936fe96396f3cf490b0984a4798d741d8/details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows</a> that on Aug. 13, 2020 someone uploaded a file with that same name and file hashes. It&#8217;s often not hard to look through VirusTotal and find files submitted by specific users over time, and several of those submitted by the same user over nearly two years include messages and files sent to email addresses for people currently working in NTIA&#8217;s information technology department.</p>
<div id="attachment_55241" style="width: 777px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/vtntiared.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55241" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-55241" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/vtntiared.png" alt="" width="767" height="510" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/vtntiared.png 1170w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/vtntiared-768x511.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/vtntiared-782x520.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-55241" class="wp-caption-text">An apparently internal email that got uploaded to VirusTotal in Feb. 2020 by the same account that uploaded the Sunshuttle backdoor malware to VirusTotal in August 2020.</p></div>
<p>The NTIA did not respond to requests for comment. But in December 2020, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/barr-points-finger-at-russia-for-solarwinds-hack-11608573971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> the NTIA was among multiple federal agencies that had email and files plundered by the SolarWinds attackers. &#8220;The hackers broke into about three dozen email accounts since June at the NTIA, including accounts belonging to the agency’s senior leadership, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter,&#8221; The Journal wrote.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what, if anything, NTIA&#8217;s IT staff did in response to scanning the backdoor file back in Aug. 2020. But the world would not find out about the SolarWinds debacle until early December 2020, when FireEye first <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosed the extent of its own compromise from the SolarWinds malware</a> and <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published details about the tools and techniques</a> used by the perpetrators.</p>
<p>The SolarWinds attack involved malicious code being surreptitiously inserted into updates shipped by SolarWinds for some 18,000 users of its <strong>Orion</strong> network management software. Beginning in March 2020, the attackers then used the access afforded by the compromised SolarWinds software to push additional backdoors and tools to targets when they wanted deeper access to email and network communications. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/did-someone-at-the-commerce-dept-find-a-solarwinds-backdoor-in-aug-2020/#more-55234" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
