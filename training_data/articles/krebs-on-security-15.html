												<p>The body of a man found shot inside a burned out vehicle in Canada three years ago has been identified as that of <strong>Davis Wolfgang Hawke</strong>, a prolific spammer and neo-Nazi who led a failed anti-government march on Washington, D.C. in 1999, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Homicide detectives said they originally thought the man found June 14, 2017 in a torched SUV on a logging road in Squamish, British Columbia was a local rock climber known to others in the area as a politically progressive vegan named Jesse James.</p>

<p>But according to <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/mobile/man-found-dead-in-b-c-believed-to-be-u-s-spam-nazi-linked-to-buried-gold-1.5166131?cache=jhiggtiw%3FclipId%3D1920563%3Fot%3DAjaxLayout#_gus&amp;_gucid=&amp;_gup=Facebook&amp;_gsc=cemNVxP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a report</a> from <em>CTV News</em>, at a press conference late last month authorities said new DNA evidence linked to a missing persons investigation has confirmed the man&#8217;s true identity as Davis Wolfgang Hawke.</p>
<p>A key subject of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spam-Kings-High-Rolling-Hucksters-Enlargements-ebook-dp-B00NF07FHI/dp/B00NF07FHI/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Spam Kings</em></a> by <strong>Brian McWilliams</strong>, Hawke was a Jewish-born American who&#8217;d legally changed his name from <strong>Andrew Britt Greenbaum</strong>. For many years, Hawke was a big time purveyor of spam emails hawking pornography and male enhancement supplements, such as herbal Viagra.</p>
<p>Hawke had reportedly bragged about the money he earned from spam, but told friends he didn&#8217;t trust banks and decided to convert his earnings into gold and platinum bars. That sparked rumors that he had possibly buried his ill-gotten gains on his parents&#8217; Massachusetts property.</p>
<p>In 2005, AOL won a $12.8 million lawsuit against him for relentlessly spamming its users. A year later, AOL won a court judgment <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2006/08/16/news/companies/aol/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authorizing them to dig on that property</a>, although no precious metals were ever found. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/body-found-in-canada-identified-as-neo-nazi-spam-king/#more-53524" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>Companies hit by ransomware often face a dual threat: Even if they avoid paying the ransom and can restore things from scratch, about half the time the attackers also threaten to release sensitive stolen data unless the victim pays for a promise to have the data deleted. Leaving aside the notion that victims might have any real expectation the attackers will actually destroy the stolen data, new research suggests a fair number of victims who do pay up may see some or all of the stolen data published anyway.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-53514" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware.png" alt="" width="595" height="446" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware.png 1016w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware-768x575.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<p>The findings come in <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/q3-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a report today</a> from <strong>Coveware</strong>, a company that specializes in helping firms recover from ransomware attacks. Coveware says nearly half of all ransomware cases now include the threat to release exfiltrated data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, when a victim of ransomware had adequate backups, they would just restore and go on with life; there was zero reason to even engage with the threat actor,&#8221; the report observes. &#8220;Now, when a threat actor steals data, a company with perfectly restorable backups is often compelled to at least engage with the threat actor to determine what data was taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coveware said it has seen ample evidence of victims seeing some or all of their stolen data published after paying to have it deleted; in other cases, the data gets published online before the victim is even given a chance to negotiate a data deletion agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike negotiating for a decryption key, negotiating for the suppression of stolen data has no finite end,&#8221; the report continues. &#8220;Once a victim receives a decryption key, it can’t be taken away and does not degrade with time. With stolen data, a threat actor can return for a second payment at any point in the future. The track records are too short and evidence that defaults are selectively occurring is already collecting.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_53511" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cw-dd.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53511" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-53511" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cw-dd.png" alt="" width="599" height="126" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cw-dd.png 970w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cw-dd-768x162.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-53511" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Coveware Q3 2020 report.</p></div>
<p>The company said it advises clients never to pay a data deletion ransom, but rather to engage competent privacy attorneys, perform an investigation into what data was stolen, and notify any affected customers according to the advice of counsel and application data breach notification laws.</p>
<p><strong>Fabian Wosar</strong>, chief technology officer at computer security firm <a href="https://www.emsisoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emsisoft</a>, said ransomware victims often acquiesce to data publication extortion demands when they are trying to prevent the public from learning about the breach.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote pqleft">&#8220;The bottom line is, ransomware is a business of hope,&#8221; Wosar said.</span> &#8220;The company doesn&#8217;t want the data to be dumped or sold. So they pay for it hoping the threat actor deletes the data. Technically speaking, whether they delete the data or not doesn&#8217;t matter from a legal point of view. The data was lost at the point when it was exfiltrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ransomware victims who pay for a digital key to unlock servers and desktop systems encrypted by the malware also are relying on hope, Wosar said, because it&#8217;s also not uncommon that a decryption key fails to unlock some or all of the infected machines.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at a lot of ransom notes, you can actually see groups address this very directly and have texts that say stuff along the lines of, Yeah, you are fucked now. But if you pay us, everything can go back to before we fucked you.'&#8221;</p>

												<p>Two young men from the eastern United States have been hit with identity theft and conspiracy charges for allegedly stealing bitcoin and social media accounts by tricking employees at wireless phone companies into giving away credentials needed to remotely access and modify customer account information.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45224" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/phonescam.png" alt="" width="593" height="374" /></p>
<p>Prosecutors say <strong>Jordan K. Milleson</strong>, 21 of Timonium, Md. and 19-year-old Kingston, Pa. resident <strong>Kyell A. Bryan</strong> hijacked social media and bitcoin accounts using a mix of voice phishing or &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=vishing&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vishing</a>&#8221; attacks and &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim+swapping&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIM swapping</a>,&#8221; a form of fraud that involves bribing or tricking employees at mobile phone companies.</p>
<p>Investigators allege the duo set up phishing websites that mimicked legitimate employee portals belonging to wireless providers, and then emailed and/or called employees at these providers in a bid to trick them into logging in at these fake portals.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/KyellBryan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the indictment</a> (PDF), Milleson and Bryan used their phished access to wireless company employee tools to reassign the subscriber identity module (SIM) tied to a target&#8217;s mobile device. A SIM card is a small, removable smart chip in mobile phones that links the device to the customer&#8217;s phone number, and their purloined access to employee tools meant they could reassign any customer&#8217;s phone number to a SIM card in a mobile device they controlled.</p>
<p>That allowed them to seize control over a target&#8217;s incoming phone calls and text messages, which were used to reset the password for email, social media and cryptocurrency accounts tied to those numbers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the conspiracy appears to have unraveled over a business dispute between the two men. Prosecutors say on June 26, 2019, &#8220;Bryan called the Baltimore County Police Department and falsely reported that he, purporting to be a resident of the Milleson family residence, had shot his father at the residence.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/two-charged-in-sim-swapping-vishing-scams/#more-53497" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>On Monday, Oct. 26, KrebsOnSecurity began following up on a tip from a reliable source that an aggressive Russian cybercriminal gang known for deploying ransomware was preparing to disrupt information technology systems at hundreds of hospitals, clinics and medical care facilities across the United States. Today, officials from the <strong>FBI</strong> and the <strong>U.S. Department of Homeland Security</strong> hastily assembled a conference call with healthcare industry executives warning about an &#8220;imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53477" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/medsec.png" alt="" width="590" height="646" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/medsec.png 800w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/medsec-768x841.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p>The agencies on the conference call, which included the <strong>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</strong> (HHS), warned participants about &#8220;credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to US hospitals and healthcare providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agencies said they were sharing the information &#8220;to provide warning to healthcare providers to ensure that they take timely and reasonable precautions to protect their networks from these threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warning came less than two days after this author received a tip from <strong>Alex Holden</strong>, founder of Milwaukee-based cyber intelligence firm <a href="https://www.holdsecurity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hold Security</a>. Holden said he saw online communications this week between cybercriminals affiliated with a Russian-speaking ransomware group known as <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ryuk&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryuk</a> in which group members discussed plans to deploy ransomware at more than 400 healthcare facilities in the U.S.</p>
<p>One participant on the government conference call today said the agencies offered few concrete details of how healthcare organizations might better protect themselves against this threat actor or purported malware campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t share any IoCs [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_of_compromise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicators of compromise</a>], so it&#8217;s just been &#8216;patch your systems and report anything suspicious&#8217;,&#8221; said a healthcare industry veteran who sat in on the discussion.</p>
<p>However, others on the call said IoCs may be of little help for hospitals that have already been infiltrated by Ryuk. That&#8217;s because the malware infrastructure used by the Ryuk gang is often unique to each victim, including everything from the Microsoft Windows executable files that get dropped on the infected hosts to the so-called &#8220;command and control&#8221; servers used to transmit data between and among compromised systems.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, cybersecurity incident response firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> today <a href="https://gist.github.com/aaronst/6aa7f61246f53a8dd4befea86e832456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released a list of domains and Internet addresses used by Ryuk</a> in previous attacks throughout 2020 and up to the present day. Mandiant refers to the group by the threat actor classification &#8220;UNC1878,&#8221; and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhjQ6zsCVSc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aired a webcast today</a> detailing some of Ryuk&#8217;s latest exploitation tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Carmakal</strong>, senior vice president for Mandiant, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-cyber/fbi-probes-string-of-recent-ransomware-attacks-on-us-hospitals-idUSKBN27D35U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Reuters</a> that UNC1878 is one of most brazen, heartless, and disruptive threat actors he&#8217;s observed over the course of his career.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multiple hospitals have already been significantly impacted by Ryuk ransomware and their networks have been taken offline,&#8221; Carmakal said. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/fbi-dhs-hhs-warn-of-imminent-credible-ransomware-threat-against-u-s-hospitals/#more-53465" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In March 2020, KrebsOnSecurity alerted Swedish security giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnebo_Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gunnebo Group</a> that hackers had broken into its network and sold the access to a criminal group which specializes in deploying ransomware. In August, Gunnebo said it had successfully thwarted a ransomware attack, but this week it emerged that the intruders stole and published online tens of thousands of sensitive documents &#8212; including schematics of client bank vaults and surveillance systems.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53451" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gunnebo.jpeg" alt="" width="588" height="329" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gunnebo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gunnebo Group</a> is a Swedish multinational company that provides physical security to a variety of customers globally, including banks, government agencies, airports, casinos, jewelry stores, tax agencies and even nuclear power plants. The company has operations in 25 countries, more than 4,000 employees, and billions in revenue annually.</p>
<p>Acting on a tip from Milwaukee, Wis.-based cyber intelligence firm <a href="https://www.holdsecurity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hold Security</a>, KrebsOnSecurity in March told Gunnebo about a financial transaction between a malicious hacker and a cybercriminal group which specializes in deploying ransomware. That transaction included credentials to a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/hacked-via-rdp-really-dumb-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Desktop Protocol</a> (RDP) account apparently set up by a Gunnebo Group employee who wished to access the company&#8217;s internal network remotely.</p>
<p>Five months later, Gunnebo <a href="https://news.cision.com/se/gunnebo/r/en-organiserad-it-attack-anmald-till-sapo,c3181154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disclosed</a> it had suffered a cyber attack targeting its IT systems that forced the shutdown of internal servers. Nevertheless, the company said its quick reaction prevented the intruders from spreading the ransomware throughout its systems, and that the overall lasting impact from the incident was minimal.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Swedish news agency <em>Dagens Nyheter</em> <a href="https://www.dn.se/ekonomi/enorm-sakerhetslacka-hemliga-uppgifter-om-riksdagen-och-banker-ute-pa-natet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that hackers recently published online at least 38,000 documents stolen from Gunnebo&#8217;s network. <strong>Linus Larsson</strong>, the journalist who broke the story, says the hacked material was uploaded to a public server during the second half of September, and it is not known how many people may have gained access to it.</p>
<p>Larsson quotes <strong>Gunnebo CEO Stefan Syrén</strong> saying the company never considered paying the ransom the attackers demanded in exchange for not publishing its internal documents. What&#8217;s more, Syrén seemed to downplay the severity of the exposure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that you can see drawings as sensitive, but we do not consider them as sensitive automatically,&#8221; the CEO reportedly said. &#8220;When it comes to cameras in a public environment, for example, half the point is that they should be visible, therefore a drawing with camera placements in itself is not very sensitive.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pullquote pqright">It remains unclear whether the stolen RDP credentials were a factor in this incident. But the password to the Gunnebo RDP account &#8212; &#8220;password01&#8221; &#8212; suggests the security of its IT systems may have been lacking in other areas as well.</span></p>
<p>After this author <a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1234621914502565890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a request for contact from Gunnebo on Twitter</a>, KrebsOnSecurity heard from <strong>Rasmus Jansson</strong>, an account manager at Gunnebo who specializes in protecting client systems from electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks or disruption, short bursts of energy that can damage electrical equipment.</p>
<p>Jansson said he relayed the stolen credentials to the company&#8217;s IT specialists, but that he does not know what actions the company took in response. Reached by phone today, Jansson said he quit the company in August, right around the time Gunnebo disclosed the thwarted ransomware attack. He declined to comment on the particulars of the extortion incident.</p>
<p>Ransomware attackers often spend weeks or months inside of a target&#8217;s network before attempting to deploy malware across the network that encrypts servers and desktop systems unless and until a ransom demand is met.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because gaining the initial foothold is rarely the difficult part of the attack. In fact, many ransomware groups now have such an embarrassment of riches in this regard that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/amid-an-embarrassment-of-riches-ransom-gangs-increasingly-outsource-their-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they&#8217;ve taken to hiring external penetration testers</a> to carry out the grunt work of escalating that initial foothold into complete control over the victim&#8217;s network and any data backup systems  &#8212; a process that can be hugely time consuming.</p>
<p>But prior to launching their ransomware, it has become common practice for these extortionists to offload as much sensitive and proprietary data as possible. In some cases, this allows the intruders to profit even if their malware somehow fails to do its job. In other instances, victims are asked to pay two extortion demands: One for a digital key to unlock encrypted systems, and another in exchange for a promise not to publish, auction or otherwise trade any stolen data. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/security-blueprints-of-many-companies-leaked-in-hack-of-swedish-firm-gunnebo/#more-53445" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>For the second time in as many years, <strong>Google</strong> is working to fix a weakness in its <strong>Widevine</strong> digital rights management (DRM) technology used by online streaming sites like <strong>Disney</strong>, <strong>Hulu </strong>and<strong> Netflix </strong>to prevent their content from being pirated.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53433" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/widevine.png" alt="" width="590" height="98" /></p>
<p>The latest cracks in <a href="https://www.widevine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Widevine</a> concern the encryption technology&#8217;s protection for L3 streams, which is used for low-quality video and audio streams only. Google says the weakness does not affect L1 and L2 streams, which encompass more high-definition video and audio content.</p>
<p>&#8220;As code protection is always evolving to address new threats, we are currently working to update our <span class="il">Widevine</span> software DRM with the latest advancements in code protection to address this issue,&#8221; Google said in a written statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity.</p>
<p>In January 2019, researcher <strong>David Buchanan</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/David3141593/status/1080606827384131590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted about the L3 weakness</a> he found, but didn&#8217;t release any proof-of-concept code that others could use to exploit it before Google fixed the problem.</p>
<p>This latest Widevine hack, however, has been made into an extension for <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> users of the <strong>Google Chrome</strong> web browser and posted for download on the software development platform Github. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/google-mending-another-crack-in-widevine/#more-53427" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Some of the world&#8217;s largest Internet firms have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/tiktok-qanon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taken steps</a> to crack down on disinformation spread by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/tiktok-qanon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>QAnon</strong> conspiracy theorists</a> and the hate-filled anonymous message board <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>8chan</strong></a>. But according to a California-based security researcher, those seeking to de-platform these communities may have overlooked a simple legal solution to that end: Both the Nevada-based web hosting company owned by 8chan&#8217;s current figurehead and the California firm that provides its sole connection to the Internet are defunct businesses in the eyes of their respective state regulators.</p>
<p>In practical terms, what this means is that the legal contracts which granted these companies temporary control over large swaths of Internet address space are now null and void, and American Internet regulators would be well within their rights to cancel those contracts and reclaim the space.</p>
<div id="attachment_53382" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53382" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-53382" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png" alt="" width="597" height="263" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png 1457w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map-768x338.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-53382" class="wp-caption-text">The IP address ranges in the upper-left portion of this map of QAnon and 8kun-related sites &#8212; some 21,000 IP addresses beginning in &#8220;206.&#8221; and &#8220;207.&#8221; &#8212; are assigned to N.T. Technology Inc. Image source: twitter.com/Redrum_of_Crows</p></div>
<p>That idea was floated by <strong>Ron Guilmette</strong>, a longtime anti-spam crusader who recently turned his attention to disrupting the online presence of QAnon and 8chan (recently renamed &#8220;8kun&#8221;).</p>
<p>On Sunday, 8chan and a host of other sites related to QAnon conspiracy theories were briefly knocked offline after Guilmette called 8chan&#8217;s anti-DDoS provider and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/qanon-8chan-sites-briefly-knocked-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convinced them to stop protecting the site from crippling online attacks</a> (8Chan is now protected by an anti-DDoS provider in St. Petersburg, Russia).</p>
<p>The public face of 8chan is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/12/helicopter-repairman-leader-internets-darkest-reaches-life-times-chan-owner-jim-watkins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Watkins</a>, a pig farmer in the Philippines <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/men-qanon/story?id=73046374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who many experts believe is also the person behind the shadowy persona of &#8220;Q&#8221;</a> at the center of the conspiracy theory movement.</p>
<p>Watkin owns and operates a Reno, Nev.-based <a href="https://www.nttec.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosting firm</a> called <strong>N.T. Technology Inc</strong>. That company has a legal contract with the <strong>American Registry for Internet Numbers</strong> (ARIN), the non-profit which administers IP addresses for entities based in North America.</p>
<p>ARIN&#8217;s contract with N.T. Technology gives the latter the right to use <a href="https://bgp.he.net/AS32335#_prefixes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 21,500 IP addresses</a>. But as Guilmette discovered recently, N.T. Technology is listed in Nevada Secretary of State records as under an &#8220;administrative hold,&#8221; which according to <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-088.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nevada statute</a> is a &#8220;terminated&#8221; status indicator meaning the company no longer has the right to transact business in the state.</p>

<p>The same is true for <a href="http://www.centaurico.com/company/history.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centauri Communications</a>, a Freemont, Calif.-based Internet Service Provider that serves as N.T. Technology&#8217;s colocation provider and <a href="https://bgp.he.net/AS32335#_peers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sole connection to the larger Internet</a>. Centauri was granted <a href="https://bgp.he.net/AS19214/#_prefixes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 4,000 IPv4 addresses</a> by ARIN more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>According to the California Secretary of State, Centauri&#8217;s status as a business in the state is &#8220;suspended.&#8221; It appears that Centauri hasn&#8217;t filed any business records with the state since 2009, and the state subsequently suspended the company&#8217;s license to do business in Aug. 2012. Separately, the California State Franchise Tax Board (FTB) suspended this company as of April 1, 2014.</p>

												<p>A phone call to an Internet provider in Oregon on Sunday evening was all it took to briefly sideline multiple websites related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8chan/8kun</a> &#8212; a controversial online image board linked to several mass shootings &#8212; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QAnon</a>, the far-right conspiracy theory which holds that a cabal of Satanic pedophiles is running a global child sex-trafficking ring and plotting against <strong>President Donald Trump</strong>. Following a brief disruption, the sites have come back online with the help of an Internet company based in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
<div id="attachment_53382" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53382" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-53382" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png" alt="" width="597" height="263" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png 1457w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map-768x338.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-53382" class="wp-caption-text">The IP address range in the upper-right portion of this map of QAnon and 8kun-related sites &#8212; 203.28.246.0/24 &#8212; is assigned to VanwaTech and briefly went offline this evening. Source: twitter.com/<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Redrum_of_Crows.</span></p></div>
<p>A large number of 8kun and QAnon-related sites (see map above) are connected to the Web via a single Internet provider in Vancouver, Wash. called<strong> VanwaTech</strong> (a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>OrcaTech</strong>&#8220;). Previous appeals to VanwaTech to disconnect these sites have fallen on deaf ears, as the company&#8217;s owner <strong>Nick Lim</strong> <a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2019/nov/07/8chan-back-online-under-the-name-8kun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> has been working with 8kun&#8217;s administrators to keep the sites online in the name of protecting free speech.</p>
<p>But VanwaTech also had a single point of failure on its end: The swath of Internet addresses serving the various 8kun/QAnon sites were being protected from otherwise crippling and incessant distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by Hillsboro, Ore. based <strong>CNServers LLC</strong>.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, security researcher <strong>Ron Guilmette</strong> placed a phone call to CNServers&#8217; owner, who professed to be shocked by revelations that his company was helping QAnon and 8kun keep the lights on.</p>
<p>Within minutes of that call, CNServers told its customer &#8212; <strong>Spartan Host Ltd</strong>., which is registered in Belfast, Northern Ireland &#8212; that it would no longer be providing DDoS protection for the set of 254 Internet addresses that Spartan Host was routing on behalf of VanwaTech.</p>
<p>Contacted by KrebsOnSecurity, the person who answered the phone at CNServers asked not to be named in this story for fear of possible reprisals from the 8kun/QAnon crowd. But they confirmed that CNServers had indeed terminated its service with Spartan Host. That person added they weren&#8217;t a fan of either 8kun or QAnon, and said they would not self-describe as a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>CNServers said that shortly after it withdrew its DDoS protection services, Spartan Host changed its settings so that VanwaTech&#8217;s Internet addresses were protected from attacks by <strong>ddos-guard[.]net</strong>, a company based in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
<p>Spartan Host&#8217;s founder, 25-year-old <strong>Ryan McCully</strong>, confirmed CNServers&#8217; report. McCully declined to say for how long VanwaTech had been a customer, or whether Spartan Host had experienced any attacks as a result of CNServers&#8217; action. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/qanon-8chan-sites-briefly-knocked-offline/#more-53377" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>One of the digital underground&#8217;s most popular stores for peddling stolen credit card information began selling a batch of more than three million new card records this week. KrebsOnSecurity has learned the data was stolen in a lengthy data breach at more than 100 <strong>Dickey&#8217;s Barbeque Restaurant</strong> locations around the country.</p>
<div id="attachment_53359" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/js-blazingsun.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53359" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-53359" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/js-blazingsun.png" alt="" width="596" height="508" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/js-blazingsun.png 971w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/js-blazingsun-768x654.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-53359" class="wp-caption-text">An ad on the popular carding site Joker&#8217;s Stash for &#8220;BlazingSun,&#8221; which fraud experts have traced back to a card breach at Dickey&#8217;s BBQ.</p></div>
<p>On Monday, the carding bazaar Joker&#8217;s Stash debuted &#8220;<strong>BlazingSun</strong>,&#8221; a new batch of more than three million stolen card records, advertising &#8220;valid rates&#8221; of between 90-100 percent. This is typically an indicator that the breached merchant is either unaware of the compromise or has only just begun responding to it.</p>
<p>Multiple companies that track the sale in stolen payment card data say they have confirmed with card-issuing financial institutions that the accounts for sale in the BlazingSun batch have one common theme: All were used at various <a href="https://www.dickeys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dickey&#8217;s BBQ</a> locations over the past 13-15 months.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity first contacted Dallas-based Dickey&#8217;s on Oct. 13. Today, the company shared a statement saying it was aware of a possible payment card security incident at some of its eateries:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We received a report indicating that a payment card security incident may have occurred. We are taking this incident very seriously and immediately initiated our response protocol and an investigation is underway. We are currently focused on determining the locations affected and time frames involved. We are utilizing the experience of third parties who have helped other restaurants address similar issues and also working with the FBI and payment card networks. We understand that payment card network rules generally provide that individuals who timely report unauthorized charges to the bank that issued their card are not responsible for those charges.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The confirmations came from Miami-based <a href="https://www.q6cyber.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q6 Cyber</a> and <a href="https://www.geminiadvisory.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini Advisory</a> in New York City.</p>
<p>Q6Cyber <strong>CEO Eli Dominitz</strong> said the breach appears to extend from May 2019 through September 2020. </p>
<p>&#8220;The financial institutions we&#8217;ve been working with have already seen a significant amount of fraud related to these cards,&#8221; Dominitz said. </p>
<p>Gemini says its data indicated some 156 Dickey&#8217;s locations across 30 states likely had payment systems compromised by card-stealing malware, with the highest exposure in California and Arizona. Gemini puts the exposure window between July 2019 and August 2020.</p>

<p>With the threat from ransomware attacks grabbing all the headlines, it may be tempting to assume plain old credit card thieves have moved on to more lucrative endeavors. Alas, cybercrime bazaars like Joker&#8217;s Stash have continued plying their trade, undeterred by a push from the credit card associations to encourage more merchants to install credit card readers that require more secure chip-based payment cards.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because there are countless restaurants &#8212; usually franchise locations of an established eatery chain &#8212; that are left to decide for themselves whether and how quickly they should make the upgrades necessary to dip the chip versus swipe the stripe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dickey&#8217;s operates on a franchise model, which often allows each location to dictate the type of point-of-sale (POS) device and processors that they utilize,&#8221; Gemini wrote in <a href="https://geminiadvisory.io/jokers-stash-breaches-dickeys/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about the incident. &#8220;However, given the widespread nature of the breach, the exposure may be linked to a breach of the single central processor, which was leveraged by over a quarter of all Dickey’s locations.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/breach-at-dickeys-bbq-smokes-3m-cards/#more-53358" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>It&#8217;s Cybersecurity Awareness Month! In keeping with that theme, if you (ab)use <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> computers you should be aware the company shipped a bevy of software updates today to fix at least 87 security problems in Windows and programs that run on top of the operating system. That means it&#8217;s once again time to backup and patch up.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-52647" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png" alt="" width="589" height="432" /></p>
<p>Eleven of the vulnerabilities earned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; rating, which means bad guys or malware could use them to gain complete control over an unpatched system with little or no help from users.</p>
<p>Worst in terms of outright scariness is probably <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-16898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2020-16898</a>, which is a nasty bug in <strong>Windows 10</strong> and <strong>Windows Server 2019</strong> that could be abused to install malware just by sending a malformed packet of data at a vulnerable system. CVE-2020-16898 earned a <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVSS Score</a> of 9.8 (10 is the most awful).</p>
<p>Security vendor <strong>McAfee</strong> has dubbed the flaw &#8220;<strong>Bad Neighbor</strong>,&#8221; and in <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/cve-2020-16898-bad-neighbor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a> about it said a proof-of-concept exploit shared by Microsoft with its partners appears to be &#8220;both extremely simple and perfectly reliable,&#8221; noting that this sucker is imminently &#8220;wormable&#8221; &#8212; i.e. capable of being weaponized into a threat that spreads very quickly within networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It results in an immediate BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), but more so, indicates the likelihood of exploitation for those who can manage to bypass Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019 mitigations,&#8221; McAfee&#8217;s <strong>Steve Povolny</strong> wrote. &#8220;The effects of an exploit that would grant remote code execution would be widespread and highly impactful, as this type of bug could be made wormable.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Trend Micro&#8217;s Zero Day Initiative</strong> (ZDI) calls special attention to another critical bug quashed in this month&#8217;s patch batch: <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-16947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2020-16947</a>, which is a problem with <strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong> that could result in malware being loaded onto a system<em> just by previewing a malicious email in Outlook</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Preview Pane is an attack vector here, so you don’t even need to open the mail to be impacted,&#8221; said ZDI&#8217;s<strong> Dustin Childs</strong>.</p>
<p>While there don&#8217;t appear to be any zero-day flaws in October&#8217;s release from Microsoft, <strong>Todd Schell</strong> from <strong>Ivanti</strong> points out that a half-dozen of these flaws were publicly disclosed prior to today, meaning bad guys have had a jump start on being able to research and engineer working exploits. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/microsoft-patch-tuesday-october-2020-edition/#more-53321" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
