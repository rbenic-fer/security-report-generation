												<p>Over the past four years, KrebsOnSecurity has been targeted by countless denial-of-service attacks intended to knock it offline. Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity was hit by easily the most massive and intense such attack yet &#8212; a nearly 200 Gbps assault leveraging a simple attack method that industry experts say is becoming alarmingly common.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/prolexicattack.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-24897" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/prolexicattack-285x189.png" alt="prolexicattack" width="285" height="189" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/prolexicattack-285x189.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/prolexicattack.png 597w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a></p>
<p>At issue is a seemingly harmless feature built into many Internet servers known as the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTP_server_misuse_and_abuse" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTP_server_misuse_and_abuse" target="_blank">Network Time Protocol</a> (NTP), which is used to sync the date and time between machines on a network. The problem isn&#8217;t with NTP itself, per se, but with certain outdated or hard-coded implementations of it that attackers can use to turn a relatively negligible attack into something much, much bigger. <strong>Symantec</strong>&#8216;s <a title="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hackers-spend-christmas-break-launching-large-scale-ntp-reflection-attacks" href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hackers-spend-christmas-break-launching-large-scale-ntp-reflection-attacks" target="_blank">writeup</a> on this threat from December 2013 explains the problem succinctly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Similar to DNS amplification attacks, the attacker sends a small forged packet that requests a large amount of data be sent to the target IP Address. In this case, the attackers are taking advantage of the <strong>monlist command</strong>.  Monlist is a remote command in older version of NTP that sends the requester a list of the last 600 hosts who have connected to that server.  For attackers the monlist query is a great reconnaissance tool.  For a localized NTP server it can help to build a network profile.  However, as a DDoS tool, it is even better because a small query can redirect megabytes worth of traffic.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Matthew Prince</strong>, the CEO of <strong>Cloudflare</strong> &#8212; a company that helps Web sites stay online in the face of huge DDoS attacks &#8212; <a title="http://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-behind-a-400gbps-ntp-amplification-ddos-attack" href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-details-behind-a-400gbps-ntp-amplification-ddos-attack" target="_blank">blogged</a> Thursday about a nearly 400 Gbps attack that recently hit one of the company&#8217;s customers and leveraged NTP amplification. Prince said that while Cloudflare &#8220;generally [was] able to mitigate the attack, it was large enough that it caused network congestion in parts of Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monday&#8217;s DDoS proved these attacks aren&#8217;t just theoretical. To generate approximately 400Gbps of traffic, the attacker used 4,529 NTP servers running on 1,298 different networks,&#8221; Prince wrote. &#8220;On average, each of these servers sent 87Mbps of traffic to the intended victim on CloudFlare&#8217;s network. Remarkably, it is possible that the attacker used only a single server running on a network that allowed source IP address spoofing to initiate the requests. An attacker with a 1 Gbps connection can theoretically generate more than 200Gbps of DDoS traffic.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/the-new-normal-200-400-gbps-ddos-attacks/#more-24271" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The breach at <strong>Target Corp.</strong> that exposed credit card and personal data on more than 110 million consumers appears to have begun with a malware-laced email phishing attack sent to employees at an HVAC firm that did business with the nationwide retailer, according to sources close to the investigation.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emaildevil.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-24825" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emaildevil-285x285.jpg" alt="Cyber attack." width="228" height="228" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emaildevil-285x285.jpg 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emaildevil-150x150.jpg 150w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emaildevil-600x600.jpg 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emaildevil.jpg 693w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /></a>Last week, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/" target="_blank">reported</a> that investigators believe the source of the Target intrusion traces back to network credentials that Target had issued to <strong>Fazio Mechanical</strong>, a heating, air conditioning and refrigeration firm in Sharpsburg, Pa.  Multiple sources close to the investigation now tell this reporter that those credentials were stolen in an email malware attack at Fazio that began at least two months before thieves started stealing card data from thousands of Target cash registers.</p>
<p>Two of those sources said the malware in question was <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=citadel&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=citadel&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">Citadel</a> &#8212; a password-stealing bot program that is a derivative of the <strong>ZeuS</strong> banking trojan &#8212; but that information could not be confirmed. Through a PR firm, Fazio declined to answer direct questions for this story, and Target has declined to comment, citing an active investigation.</p>
<p>In <a title="http://faziomechanical.com/Target-Breach-Statement.pdf" href="http://faziomechanical.com/Target-Breach-Statement.pdf" target="_blank">a statement</a> (PDF) issued last week, Fazio said it was &#8220;the victim of a sophisticated cyber attack operation,&#8221; and further that &#8220;our IT system and security measures are in full compliance with industry practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no question that, like Target, Fazio Mechanical was the victim of cybercrime. But investigators close to the case took issue with Fazio&#8217;s claim that it was in full compliance with industry practices, and offered another explanation of why it took the Fazio so long to detect the email malware infection: The company&#8217;s primary method of detecting malicious software on its internal systems was the free version of <a title="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" href="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" target="_blank">Malwarebytes Anti-Malware</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (MBAM) free is quite good at what it&#8217;s designed to do &#8211; scan for and eliminate threats from host machines. However, there are two problems with an organization relying solely on the free version of MBAM for anti-malware protection: Firstly, the free version is an on-demand scanner that does not offer real-time protection against threats (the <a title="https://www.malwarebytes.org/pro/" href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/pro/" target="_blank">Pro version</a> of MBAM <em>does</em> include a real-time protection component). Secondly, the free version <em>is made explicitly for individual users and its license prohibits corporate use</em>.</p>
<p>Fazio&#8217;s statement also clarified that its data connection to Target was exclusively for electronic billing, contract submission and project management. The company did not specify which component(s) of Target&#8217;s online operations that Fazio accessed externally, but a former employee at Target said nearly all Target contractors access an external billing system called <a title="https://service.ariba.com/Supplier.aw/621703/aw?awh=r&amp;awssk=OMStlAv9&amp;dard=1" href="https://service.ariba.com/Supplier.aw/621703/aw?awh=r&amp;awssk=OMStlAv9&amp;dard=1" target="_blank">Ariba</a>, as well as a Target project management and contract submissions portal called <a title="https://wamlogin.partnersonline.com/securitybrokerage/pub/login.htm?TYPE=33554433&amp;REALMOID=06-0fb16762-e63c-4dfe-a532-445551a2cc51&amp;GUID=&amp;SMAUTHREASON=0&amp;METHOD=GET&amp;SMAGENTNAME=$SM$cc00Zase4DnYh8i1ouaTStDOm1cY5nFYdGTFhrO4YJmPrPT7tLYI0Xo%2bdoEIoCNJ&amp;TARGET=$SM$https%3a%2f%2fwww%2epartnersonline%2ecom%2f" href="https://wamlogin.partnersonline.com/securitybrokerage/pub/login.htm?TYPE=33554433&amp;REALMOID=06-0fb16762-e63c-4dfe-a532-445551a2cc51&amp;GUID=&amp;SMAUTHREASON=0&amp;METHOD=GET&amp;SMAGENTNAME=$SM$cc00Zase4DnYh8i1ouaTStDOm1cY5nFYdGTFhrO4YJmPrPT7tLYI0Xo%2bdoEIoCNJ&amp;TARGET=$SM$https%3a%2f%2fwww%2epartnersonline%2ecom%2f" target="_blank">Partners Online</a>. The source said Fazio also would have had access to Target&#8217;s <a title="https://pdzone.target.com/portal-target/templates/html/login_new.jsp?TYPE=33554433&amp;REALMOID=06-f980003e-9313-4487-9ac0-98f792cd3f2f&amp;GUID=&amp;SMAUTHREASON=0&amp;METHOD=GET&amp;SMAGENTNAME=-SM-pE3oyZbm8QUgajXyF0U%2bN90sEDwYJr1Uba9SdRrCZOl5LpIlHIpFKsYwdcu8cz5%2f&amp;TARGET=-SM-HTTP%3a%2f%2fpdzone%2etarget%2ecom%2fportal--target%2ftemplates%2fhtml%2fexternal_content_display%2ejsp%3fcontentid%3dPRD02--035451" href="https://pdzone.target.com/portal-target/templates/html/login_new.jsp?TYPE=33554433&amp;REALMOID=06-f980003e-9313-4487-9ac0-98f792cd3f2f&amp;GUID=&amp;SMAUTHREASON=0&amp;METHOD=GET&amp;SMAGENTNAME=-SM-pE3oyZbm8QUgajXyF0U%2bN90sEDwYJr1Uba9SdRrCZOl5LpIlHIpFKsYwdcu8cz5%2f&amp;TARGET=-SM-HTTP%3a%2f%2fpdzone%2etarget%2ecom%2fportal--target%2ftemplates%2fhtml%2fexternal_content_display%2ejsp%3fcontentid%3dPRD02--035451" target="_blank">Property Development Zone portal</a>.</p>
<p>According to a former member of Target&#8217;s security team who asked not to be identified, when a work order for an external vendor is created, the payment is collected through the Ariba system: Vendors log into Ariba, complete the necessary steps to close out the work order and they are later paid. But how would the attackers have moved from Target&#8217;s external billing system into an internal portion of the network occupied by point-of-sale devices? The former Target network expert has a theory:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that the Ariba system has a back end that Target administrators use to maintain the system and provide vendors with login credentials, [and] I would have to speculate that once a vendor logs into the portal they have active access to the server that runs the application,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;Most, if not almost all, internal applications at Target used <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory" target="_blank">Active Directory (AD) credentials</a> and I&#8217;m sure the Ariba system was no exception. I wouldn&#8217;t say the vendor had AD credentials but that the internal administrators would use their AD login to access the system from inside. This would mean the sever had access to the rest of the corporate network in some form or another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s story about Fazio&#8217;s role in the attack on Target mentioned that Target could be facing steep fines if it was discovered that the company was not in compliance with payment card industry (PCI) security standards. Among those is a requirement that merchants incorporate two-factor authentication for remote network access originating from outside the network by personnel and all third parties.</p>
<p>Another source who managed Target vendors for a number of years until quite recently said that only &#8220;in rare cases&#8221; would Target have required a vendor to use a one-time token or other two-factor authentication approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the vendors in the highest security group &#8212; those required to directly access confidential information &#8212; would be given a token, and instructions on how to access that portion of the network,&#8221; the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  &#8220;Target would have paid very little attention to vendors like Fazio, and I would be surprised if there was ever even a basic security assessment done of those types of vendors by Target.&#8221;</p>
<p>But according to <strong>Avivah Litan</strong>, a fraud analyst at <strong>Gartner</strong>, Target wouldn&#8217;t have needed to require vendors to use two-factor logins if the company believed it had taken steps to isolate the vendor portals from its payment network.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fairness to Target, if they thought their network was properly segmented, they wouldn&#8217;t have needed to have two-factor access for everyone,&#8221; Litan said. &#8220;But if someone got in there and somehow escalated their Active Directory privileges like you described, that might have [bridged] that segmentation.&#8221;</p>
<p>OPEN-SOURCE INTEL</p>
<p>Many readers have questioned why the attackers would have picked on an HVAC firm as a conduit for hacking Target. The answer is that they probably didn&#8217;t, at least at first. Many of these email malware attacks start with shotgun attacks that blast out email far and wide; only after the attackers have had time to comb through the victim list for interesting targets do they begin to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>
<p>But Target may have inadvertently made it easier for the attackers in this case, in part by leaving massive amounts of internal documentation for vendors on its various public-facing Web properties that do not require a login. Indeed, many of these documents would be a potential gold mine of information for an attacker.</p>

												<p><strong>Adobe</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> today each issued patches to fix critical security flaws in their software. Microsoft&#8217;s February Patch Tuesday includes seven patch bundles addressing at least 31 vulnerabilities in <strong>Windows</strong> and related software. Adobe pushed out an update that fixes two critical bugs in its <strong>Shockwave Player</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/crackedwin.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-19861" alt="crackedwin" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/crackedwin.png" width="212" height="251" /></a>More than half of the updates issued by Microsoft today earned a &#8220;critical&#8221; rating &#8212; Microsoft&#8217;s most dire. That rating is assigned to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware or malcontents to take complete, remote control over vulnerable systems &#8212; with no help from users.</p>
<p>Microsoft is urging Windows users to apply all of the available fixes, but for those who need to prioritize patches (organizations that typically test patches before deploying them enterprise-wide), Redmond places a special focus on <a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms14-007" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms14-007" target="_blank">MS14-007</a>, a graphics vulnerability in Windows 7/8/8.1 and Windows Server 2007, 2012 and Windows RT.</p>
<p>The cumulative, critical security update for all versions of <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> (<a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms14-010" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms14-010" target="_blank">MS14-010</a>) fixes two dozen vulnerabilities, including one that Microsoft says has already been publicly disclosed. The other patch that Microsoft specifically called out &#8212; <a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms14-011" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms14-011" target="_blank">MS14-011</a> &#8212; addresses a vulnerability in VBScript that could cause problems for IE users.</p>
<p>Microsoft also once again is encouraging Windows users who haven&#8217;t already done so to consider installing and using its <strong>Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit</strong> (EMET), a free tool that can help to significantly beef up the security of third-party applications that run on top of Windows. I would second their recommendation, and have reviewed EMET 4.0 <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/windows-security-101-emet-4-0/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/windows-security-101-emet-4-0/" target="_blank">here</a>. The latest version &#8212; 4.1 &#8212; is available <a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/jj653751" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/jj653751" target="_blank">at this link</a> and requires <a title="http://www.microsoft.com/net/download/installation-help" href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/download/installation-help" target="_blank">Microsoft&#8217;s .NET Framework 4 platform</a>.</p>

												<p>State authorities in Florida on Thursday announced criminal charges targeting three men who allegedly ran illegal businesses moving large amounts of cash in and out of the <strong>Bitcoin</strong> virtual currency. Experts say this is likely the first case in which Bitcoin vendors have been prosecuted under state anti-money laundering laws, and that prosecutions like these could shut down one of the last remaining avenues for purchasing Bitcoins anonymously.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/michaelhackfeedback.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-24756" alt="michaelhackfeedback" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/michaelhackfeedback-285x176.png" width="285" height="176" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/michaelhackfeedback-285x176.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/michaelhackfeedback-600x372.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/michaelhackfeedback.png 1217w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a>Working in conjunction with the <strong>Miami Beach Police Department</strong> and the Miami-Dade State Attorney&#8217;s office, undercover officers and agents from the <strong>U.S. Secret Service&#8217;s Miami Electronic Crimes Task Force</strong> contacted several individuals who were facilitating high-dollar transactions via <a title="http://www.localbitcoins.com" href="http://www.localbitcoins.com" target="_blank">localbitcoins.com</a>, a site that helps match buyers and sellers of the virtual currency so that transactions can be completed face-to-face.</p>
<p>One of those contacted was a localbitcoins.com user nicknamed &#8220;Michelhack.&#8221; <a title="https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/michelhack/" href="https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/michelhack/" target="_blank">According to this user&#8217;s profile</a>, Michelhack has at least 100 confirmed trades in the past six months involving more than 150 Bitcoins (more than $110,000 in today&#8217;s value), and a 99 percent positive &#8220;feedback&#8221; score on the marketplace. The undercover agent and Michelhack allegedly arranged a face-to-face meeting and exchanged a single Bitcoin for $1,000, a price that investigators say included an almost 17 percent conversion fee.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the agent told Michelhack that he wanted to use the Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards online. After that trust-building transaction, Michelhack allegedly agreed to handle a much larger deal: Converting $30,000 in cash into Bitcoins.</p>
<p>Investigators had little trouble tying that Michelhack identity to <a title="https://web.archive.org/web/20120407142438/http://michelhack.com/myresume" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120407142438/http://michelhack.com/myresume" target="_blank">30-year-old Michell Abner Espinoza</a> of Miami Beach. Espinoza was arrested yesterday when he met with undercover investigators to finalize the transaction. Espinoza is charged with felony violations of Florida&#8217;s <a title="http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/560.125" href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/560.125" target="_blank">law against unlicensed money transmitters</a> &#8212; which prohibits &#8220;currency or payment instruments exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month period&#8221; &#8212; and <a title="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0800-0899/0896/0896.html" href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0800-0899/0896/0896.html" target="_blank">Florida&#8217;s anti-money laundering statutes</a>, which prohibit the trade or business in currency of more than $10,000.</p>
<p>Police also conducted a search warrant on his residence with an order to seize computer systems and digital media. Also arrested Thursday and charged with violating both Florida laws is <strong>Pascal Reid</strong>, 29, a Canadian citizen who was living in Miramar, Fla. Allegedly operating as <a title="https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/proy33/" href="https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/proy33/" target="_blank">proy33 on localbitcoins.com</a>, Reid was arrested while meeting with an undercover agent to finalize a deal to sell $30,000 worth of Bitcoins.</p>
<p>Documents obtained from the Florida state court system show that investigators believe Reid had 403 Bitcoins in his on-phone Bitcoin wallet alone &#8212; which at the time was the equivalent of approximately USD $316,000. Those same documents show that the undercover agent told Reid he wanted to use the Bitcoins to buy <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/cards-stolen-in-target-breach-flood-underground-markets/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/cards-stolen-in-target-breach-flood-underground-markets/" target="_blank">credit cards stolen in the Target breach</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong>, a researcher at the <a title="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank">International Computer Science Institute</a> (ICSI) and at the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong> and keen follower of Bitcoin-related news, said he is unaware of another case in which state law has been used against a Bitcoin vendor. According to Weaver, the Florida case is significant because localbitcoins.com is among the last remaining places that Americans can use to purchase Bitcoins anonymously.</p>
<p>“The biggest problem that Bitcoin faces is actually self-imposed, because it’s always hard to buy Bitcoins,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;The reason is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and therefore any purchase of Bitcoins must be made with something irreversible &#8212; namely cash. And that means you either have to wait several days for the wire transfer or bank transfer to go through, or if you want to buy them quickly you pay with cash through a site like localbitcoins.com.&#8221;  <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/florida-targets-high-dollar-bitcoin-exchangers/#more-24742" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Last week, <strong>Target</strong> told reporters at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>Reuters</em> that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were stolen from a third party vendor. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a refrigeration, heating and air conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a number of locations at Target and other top retailers.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hvachoover.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-24711" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hvachoover-285x189.jpg" alt="hvachoover" width="285" height="189" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hvachoover-285x189.jpg 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hvachoover-600x399.jpg 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hvachoover.jpg 849w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a>Sources close to the investigation said the attackers first broke into the retailer&#8217;s network on Nov. 15, 2013 using network credentials stolen from <a title="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_j7HztU4io4J:faziomechanical.com/projects.html+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_j7HztU4io4J:faziomechanical.com/projects.html+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" target="_blank">Fazio Mechanical Services</a>, a Sharpsburg, Penn.-based provider of refrigeration and <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC" target="_blank">HVAC systems</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fazio president Ross Fazio</strong> confirmed that the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> visited his company&#8217;s offices in connection with the Target investigation, but said he was not present when the visit occurred. Fazio Vice President <strong>Daniel Mitsch </strong>declined to answer questions about the visit. According to the company&#8217;s homepage, Fazio Mechanical also has done refrigeration and HVAC projects for specific Trader Joe&#8217;s, Whole Foods and BJ&#8217;s Wholesale Club locations in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Target spokeswoman <strong>Molly Snyder</strong> said the company had no additional information to share, citing a &#8220;very active and ongoing investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target&#8217;s payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be named because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that routinely monitors energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save on costs (particularly at night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the stores fluctuate outside of an acceptable range that could prevent customers from shopping at the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;To support this solution, vendors need to be able to remote into the system in order to do maintenance (updates, patches, etc.) or to troubleshoot glitches and connectivity issues with the software,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;This feeds into the topic of cost savings, with so many solutions in a given organization. And to save on head count, it is sometimes beneficial to allow a vendor to support versus train or hire extra people.&#8221;</p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>Ever since news broke that thieves stole more than 40 million debit and credit card accounts from <strong>Target</strong> using a strain of <strong>P</strong>oint-<strong>O</strong>f-<strong>S</strong>ale malware known as <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-first-look-at-the-target-intrusion-malware/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-first-look-at-the-target-intrusion-malware/" target="_blank">BlackPOS</a>, much speculation has swirled around unanswered questions, such as how this malware was introduced into the network, and what mechanisms were used to infect thousands of Target&#8217;s cash registers.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BLACKPOS-copy.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-24675" alt="BLACKPOS copy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BLACKPOS-copy.png" width="191" height="466" /></a>Recently, I spoke at length with  <b>Tom Arnold</b> and <b>Paul Guthrie</b>, co-founders of <a href="http://www.paysw.com/">PSC</a>, a security firm that consults for businesses on payment security and compliance. In early 2013, these two experts worked directly on a retail data breach that involved a version of BlackPOS. They agreed to talk about their knowledge of this malware, and how the attackers worked to defeat the security of the retail client (not named in this story).</p>
<p>While some of this discussion may be geektacular at times (what I affectionately like to call &#8220;Geek Factor 5&#8221;), there&#8217;s something in here for everyone. Their observations about the methods and approaches used in this attack point to an adversary that is skilled, organized, patient and thorough.</p>
<p><b>So you first saw BlackPOS at a retailer in early January 2013?</b></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Yes, it did seem like a game changer at that point because of the way it hooked into the POS system. By that I mean the fact that it hooks into the POS process, and it’s not just a general memory scraper like some people have stated.</p>
<p><b>Help me understand the distinction between a memory scraper and malware that runs completely in memory?</b></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Well, it’s very specific. It’s what&#8217;s called an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication">inter-process communications</a> hook. If you look at a memory scraper &#8212; so if you were to dump the memory on your laptop right now &#8212; you would get this big old blob of information and you would have to filter through it to find what you’re looking for. But this [malware] is very specific: It’s very much designed for the POS system it’s running on, because it knows exactly where to hook and where the memory location is going to be when the data it&#8217;s looking for is flowing through it. But if you look at what it captures, it captures only the track data [information stored on the magnetic strip on the backs of cards]. So, it’s actually very, very sophisticated and that’s why I think this isn’t just a teenage hacker who put this together in his basement. I think this is a more sophisticated development effort. [HP last week published <a title="http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Security-Research-Blog/An-evolution-of-BlackPOS-malware/ba-p/6359149" href="http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Security-Research-Blog/An-evolution-of-BlackPOS-malware/ba-p/6359149" target="_blank">some interesting, uber-geeky details</a> about the memory behavior of the version of BlackPOS found at Target].</p>
<p><b>Paul:  </b>It certainly hooks into a specific process, but we did not figure out if it was just good at scraping the memory of that process, or whether it actually altered the process to hook into the code somehow.  That part of the code was obfuscated and not reviewed during the engagement.</p>
<p><b>What did you think of the iSight paper?</b></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> The <a title="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579324902602426862" href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579324902602426862" target="_blank">iSight paper</a> was good, and what it described was very similar to what we saw in the first variants of BlackPOS. But it didn’t talk about how it appeared on the network or where it came from or how a retailer might defend themselves against it.</p>
<p><strong>In your prior experience with BlackPOS, has it been used against the same POS that Target uses? A source who seemed to have a clue told me that their setup was somewhat homegrown.</strong></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> That I don’t know.  I haven’t really looked at what Target uses. With a homegrown system, the problem is if you’re going to build a process hook, you have to have a test environment, you have to know what you’re looking at and what memory addresses to go after, and that’s not exactly something that gets published.</p>
<p><b>Paul: </b>Target has a homegrown POS.</p>
<p><b>So you think it&#8217;s likely they were using some off-the-shelf equipment and software? Wouldn’t it be enough for the attackers in this case to have obtained a physical point of sale device that was once used at Target?</b></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> If they have one, sure, that would be different. I don’t know if they’re using a commercial product. A lot of the big retailers use commercial products and will customize those with their back end system. But at the front end and what happens at front of the house&#8230;a lot of those are just retail off-the-shelf applications. A lot of those retailers, when you have a hard disk that breaks on one of the [checkout] lanes, they’ve got an outsourced service provider of that POS that comes out there with a new hard disk and fixes it.</p>
<p><strong>How do the bad guys break in, and how do they actually get the malware pushed out to the point-of-sale?</strong></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b>  A lot of the POS systems use whitelisting software of some kind, such as <a title="http://www.bit9.com" href="http://www.bit9.com" target="_blank">Bit9</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidcore_Systems">SolidCore</a>. Those two companies are the two you see most out there in the industry.</p>
<p><b>Paul:</b> It could also come in through the point-of-sale application update process.</p>
<p><b>By whitelisting, you mean sort of the opposite approach of antivirus, right? As in, if the file or program isn&#8217;t approved by the whitelisting software, it simply won&#8217;t run on the system?</b></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> The software update processes at a point-of-sale that is running one of those [whitelisting applications] has to come through one of the software update channels and has to be reviewed for the update and approved. And when it’s approved, the whitelisting software says okay this patch is approved to come online.</p>
<p><b>It&#8217;s probably a good idea at this point to make sure we&#8217;re defining the terminology in a uniform way. When you think of point-of-sale device, are you talking about the cash register, or the card swipe terminal, or&#8230;</b></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> I’m using point-of-sale to mean the payment application that is running on the cash register. The vast majority of those devices, when you check out at the grocery store or large retailer, those are just PCs, and yes they’re mostly running <b>Windows XP</b> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd180865(v=winembedded.10).aspx">WEPOS</a> as their operating system. But above that, you have what I call the point-of-sale, or the point-of-sale application, and that’s the stuff that the cashier is interfacing with at the time you’re checking out. It’s a software application, running as multiple pieces of software inside the register itself. And whitelisting is put on to protect the register from any sort of unsolicited modification. A lot of the attacks before this [whitelisting became more broadly used] involved where you corrupt a sales clerk to put a USB stick in the cash register and infect the PC with some malware. But by using a whitelisting software, the USB stick will not work and the operations personnel back in the head office will get notified that something isn’t right with that register.</p>
<p><strong>If they get past a whitelisting system, doesn’t that suggest that someone on the inside would have to be involved?</strong></p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> No, not really. You have to also consider the distribution server that distributes the point-of-sale software.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Right… three possible ways… it could come through a legitimate update channel, or the retailer was lax in their update procedures, or the attackers hacked the console of the whitelisting software and just whitelisted it themselves.  <b></b></p>

												<p>Jan. 31 marked the start of the 2014 tax filing season, and if you haven&#8217;t yet started working on your returns, here&#8217;s another reason to get motivated: Tax fraudsters and identity thieves may very well beat you to it.</p>
<p>According to <a title="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/irs-refunded-4-billion-to-identity-thieves-last-year-inspector-generals-report-says/" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/irs-refunded-4-billion-to-identity-thieves-last-year-inspector-generals-report-says/" target="_blank">a 2013 report</a> from the Treasury Inspector General&#8217;s office, the <strong>U.S. Internal Revenue Service</strong> (IRS) issued nearly $4 billion in bogus tax refunds in 2012. The money largely was sent to people who stole Social Security numbers and other information on U.S. citizens, and then filed fraudulent tax returns on those individuals claiming a large refund but at a different address.</p>
<p>There are countless shops in the cybercrime underground selling data that is especially useful for scammers engaged in tax return fraud. Typically, these shops will identify their wares as &#8220;fullz,&#8221; which include a consumer&#8217;s first name, last name, middle name, email address (and in some cases email password) physical address, phone number, date of birth, and Social Security number.</p>
<div id="attachment_24655" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trk.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24655" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-24655" alt="This fraud shop caters to thieves involved in tax return fraud." src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trk-600x356.png" width="600" height="356" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trk-600x356.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trk-285x169.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trk.png 1235w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-24655" class="wp-caption-text">This underground shop sells consumer identity data, catering to tax return fraud.</p></div>
<p>The shop pictured above, for example, caters to tax fraudsters, as evidenced by its advice to customers of the service, which can be used to find information that might help scammers establish lines of credit (PayPal accounts, credit cards) in someone else&#8217;s name:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can use on paypal credit, prepaid cards etc. After buying try to search by address and u can see children, wife and all people at this address,&#8221; the fraud shop explains, advising customers on ways to find the names and additional information on the taxpayer&#8217;s children (because more dependents mean greater tax deductions and higher refunds): &#8220;It&#8217;s great for tax return method, because u can get $$$ for &#8216;your&#8217; children.&#8221;</p>

												<p><strong>White Lodging</strong>, a company that maintains hotel franchises under nationwide brands including <strong>Hilton</strong>, <strong>Marriott</strong>, <strong></strong><strong>Sheraton</strong> and <strong>Westin</strong> appears to have suffered a data breach that exposed credit and debit card information on thousands of guests throughout much of 2013, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/whitelodging.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-24638" alt="whitelodging" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/whitelodging.png" width="239" height="82" /></a>Earlier this month, multiple sources in the banking industry began sharing data indicating that they were seeing a pattern of fraud on hundreds of cards that were all previously used at Marriott hotels from roughly March 23, 2013 on through the end of last year. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">But those sames sources said they were puzzled by the pattern of fraud, because it was seen only at specific Marriott hotels, including locations in Austin, Chicago Denver, Los Angeles, Louisville and Tampa. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Turns out, the common thread among all of those Marriott locations is that they are managed by Merrillville, Indiana-based <a title="http://www.whitelodging.com/" href="http://www.whitelodging.com/" target="_blank">White Lodging Services Corporation<strong>, </strong></a>which bills itself as &#8220;a fully-integrated owner, developer and manager of premium brand hotels.&#8221; According to the company&#8217;s Web site, White Lodging&#8217;s property portfolio includes 168 full service hotels in 21 states, with more than 30 restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">White Lodging declined to offer many details, saying in an emailed statement that &#8220;an investigation is in progress, and we will provide meaningful information as soon as it becomes available.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Update: Feb. 7, 9:32 a.m. ET: </strong>White Lodging has issued <a title="http://whitelodging.com/about/payment-card-issues" href="http://whitelodging.com/about/payment-card-issues" target="_blank">a statement</a> acknowledging a breach at 14 hotels, including Marriott, Starwood, Intercontinental and other brands. Also, NBC is <a title="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/hotels-manager-knew-breach-two-weeks-n24121" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/hotels-manager-knew-breach-two-weeks-n24121" target="_blank">reporting</a> that White Lodging knew about this breach two weeks before this breaking story was first published.</p>
<p><em>Original story:</em></p>
<p>Marriott also issued a statement, noting that &#8220;one of its franchisees has experienced unusual fraud patterns in connection with its systems that process credit card transactions at a number of hotels across a range of brands, including some Marriott-branded hotels.&#8221; The statement continues:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;They are in the midst of the investigation and are in close contact with the banks and credit cards companies.  We are working closely with the franchisee as they investigate the matter.  Because the suspected breach did not impact any systems that Marriott owns or controls, we do not have additional information to provide.  As this impacts customers of Marriott hotels we want to provide assurance that Marriott has a long-standing commitment to protect the privacy of the personal information that our guests entrust to us, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Other hotel chains franchised by White Lodging &#8212; including Hilton and Starwood Hotels (which owns the Sheraton and Westin brands) &#8212; could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Sources say the breach appears to have affected mainly restaurants, gift shops and other establishments within hotels managed by White Lodging &#8212; not the property management systems that run the hotel front desk computers which handle guests checking in and out. In the case of Marriott, for example, all Marriott establishments operated as a franchise must use Marriott&#8217;s property management system. As a result, the breach impacted only those Marriott guests who used their cards at White Lodging-managed gift shops and restaurants.</p>

												<p>An examination of the malware used in the Target breach suggests that the attackers may have had help from a poorly secured feature built into a widely-used IT management software product that was running on the retailer&#8217;s internal network.</p>
<p>As I noted in  Jan. 15&#8217;s story &#8212; <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-first-look-at-the-target-intrusion-malware/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-first-look-at-the-target-intrusion-malware/" target="_blank">A First Look at the Target Intrusion, Malware</a> &#8212; the attackers were able to infect Target&#8217;s point-of-sale registers with a malware strain that stole credit and debit card data. The intruders also set up a control server within Target&#8217;s internal network that served as a central repository for data hoovered up from all of the infected registers.</p>
<div id="attachment_24367" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackposconnect.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24367" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-24367" alt="According to sources, &quot;ttcopscli3acs&quot; is the name of the Windows share point used by the POS malware planted at Target stores; the username that the thieves used to log in remotely and download stolen card data was &quot;Best1_user&quot;; the password was &quot;BackupU$r&quot;" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackposconnect-600x74.png" width="600" height="74" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackposconnect-600x74.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackposconnect-285x35.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackposconnect.png 938w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-24367" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;ttcopscli3acs&#8221; is the name of the Windows share used by the POS malware planted at Target stores; the username that malware used to upload stolen card data was &#8220;Best1_user&#8221;; the password was &#8220;BackupU$r&#8221;</p></div>
<p>That analysis looked at a malware component used in Target breach that was uploaded to Symantec&#8217;s ThreatExpert scanning service on Dec. 18 but which was later deleted (a local PDF copy of it is <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/POSWDS-ThreatExpert-Report.pdf" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/POSWDS-ThreatExpert-Report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). The ThreatExpert writeup suggests that the malware was responsible for moving stolen data from the compromised cash registers to that shared central repository, which had the internal address of 10.116.240.31. The &#8220;ttcopscli3acs&#8221; bit is the Windows domain name used on Target&#8217;s network. The user account &#8220;Best1_user&#8221; and password &#8220;BackupU$r&#8221; were used to log in to the shared drive (indicated by the &#8220;S:&#8221; under the &#8220;Resource Type&#8221; heading in the image above.</p>
<p>That &#8220;Best1_user&#8221; account name seems an odd one for the attackers to have picked at random, but there is a better explanation: That username is the same one that gets installed with an IT management software suite called <a title="http://discovery.bmc.com/confluence/display/Configipedia/BMC+Performance+Assurance+Agent" href="http://discovery.bmc.com/confluence/display/Configipedia/BMC+Performance+Assurance+Agent" target="_blank">Performance Assurance for Microsoft Servers</a>. This product, according to its maker &#8212; Houston, Texas base <strong>BMC Software</strong> &#8212; includes administrator-level user account called &#8220;Best1_user.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="ftp://ftp.bmc.com/pub/perform/resolutions/15063490.pdf" href="ftp://ftp.bmc.com/pub/perform/resolutions/15063490.pdf" target="_blank">This knowledge base article</a> (PDF) published by BMC explains the Best1_user account is installed by the software to do routine tasks. That article states that while the Best1_user account is essentially a &#8220;system&#8221; or &#8220;administrator&#8221; level account on the host machine, customers shouldn&#8217;t concern themselves with this account because &#8220;it is not a member of any group (not even the &#8216;users&#8217; group) and therefore can&#8217;t be used to login to the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only privilege that the account is granted is the ability to run as a batch job,&#8221; the document states, indicating that it could be used to run programs if invoked from a command prompt. Here&#8217;s my favorite part:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Perform Technical Support does not have the password to this account and this password has not be released by Perform Development. Knowing the password to the account should not be important as you cannot log into the machine using this account. The password is known internally and used internally by the Perform agent to assume the identity of the &#8220;Best1_user&#8221; account.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I pinged BMC to find out if perhaps the password supplied in the Target malware (BackupU$r) is in fact the secret password for the Best1_user account. The company has so far remained silent on this question.</p>
<p>This was the hunch put forward by the Counter Threat Unit (CTU) of <strong>Dell</strong> <strong>SecureWorks</strong> in an analysis that was privately released to some of the company&#8217;s clients this week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Attackers exfiltrate data by creating a mount point for a remote file share and copying the data stored by the memory-scraping component to that share,&#8221; the SecureWorks paper notes. &#8220;In the previous listing showing the data’s move to an internal server, 10.116.240.31 is the intermediate server selected by attackers, and CTU researchers believe the “ttcopscli3acs” string is the Windows domain name used on Target’s network. The Best1_user account appears to be associated with the Performance Assurance component of BMC Software’s Patrol product. <em>According to BMC’s documentation, this account is normally restricted, but the attackers may have usurped control to facilitate lateral movement within the network.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">According to SecureWorks, one component of the malware installed itself as a service called &#8220;BladeLogic,&#8221; a service name no doubt designed to mimic another BMC product called <a title="http://www.bmc.com/products/product-listing/bladelogic-automation-suite.html" href="http://www.bmc.com/products/product-listing/bladelogic-automation-suite.html" target="_blank">BMC BladeLogic Automation Suite</a>. BMC spokeswoman <strong>Ann Duhon</strong> said that the attackers were simply invoking BMC&#8217;s trademark to make the malicious program appear legitimate to the casual observer, but it seems likely that at least some BMC software was running inside of Target&#8217;s network, and that the attackers were well aware of it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Update Jan. 30, 5:48 p.m.:</strong> BMC just issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>There have been several articles in the press speculating about the Target breach.  BMC Software has received no information from Target or the investigators regarding the breach. In some of those articles, BMC products were mentioned in two different ways.</p>
<p>The first was a mention of a &#8220;bladelogic.exe&#8221; reference in the attack.   The executable name “bladelogic.exe” does not exist in any piece of legitimate BMC software.  <a href="http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/analyzing-the-target-point-of-sale-malware" target="_blank">McAfee has issued a security advisory </a>stating that: &#8220;The reference to “bladelogic” is a method of obfuscation.  The malware does not compromise, or integrate with, any BMC products in any way.</p>
<p>The second reference was to a password that was possibly utilized as part of the attack, with the implication that it was a BMC password.  BMC has confirmed that the password mentioned in the press is not a BMC-generated password.</p>
<p>At this point, there is nothing to suggest that BMC BladeLogic or BMC Performance Assurance has a security flaw or was compromised as part of this attack.</p>
<p>Malware is a problem for all IT environments. BMC asks all of our customers to be diligent in ensuring that their environments are secure and protected.</p></blockquote>
<p>I parse their statement to mean that the &#8220;BackupU$r&#8221; password referenced in the Target malware is not their software&#8217;s secret password. But nothing in the statement seems to rule out the possibility that the attackers leveraged a domain user account installed by BMC software to help exfiltrate card data from Target&#8217;s network.</p>
<p><em>Original story:</em></p>
<p>According to a trusted source who uses mostly open-source data to keep tabs on the software and hardware used in various retail environments, BMC&#8217;s software is in use at many major retail and grocery chains across the country, including <strong>Kroger</strong>, <strong>Safeway</strong>, <strong>Home Depot</strong>, <strong>Sam&#8217;s Club</strong> and <strong>The Vons Companies</strong>, among many others.</p>
<p>A copy of the SecureWorks report is <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Inside-a-Targeted-Point-of-Sale-Data-Breach.pdf" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Inside-a-Targeted-Point-of-Sale-Data-Breach.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (PDF). It contains some fairly detailed analysis of this and other portions of the malware used in the Target intrusion. What it states up front that it does not have &#8212; and what we still have not heard from Target &#8212; is how the attackers broke in to begin with&#8230;.</p>
