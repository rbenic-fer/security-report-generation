							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>Security experts have long opined that one way to make software more secure is to hold software makers liable for vulnerabilities in their products.  This idea is often dismissed as unrealistic and one that would stifle innovation in an industry that has been a major driver of commercial growth and productivity over the years. But a new study released this week presents perhaps the clearest economic case yet for compelling companies to pay for information about security vulnerabilities in their products.</p>
<p>Before I delve into this modest proposal, let&#8217;s postulate a few assumptions that hopefully aren&#8217;t terribly divisive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern societies are becoming increasingly dependent on software and computer programs.</li>
<li>After decades of designing software, human beings still build imperfect, buggy, and insecure programs.</li>
<li>Estimates of the global damage from cybercrime ranges from the low billions to <a title="http://www.usatoday.com/story/cybertruth/2013/11/08/cybercrimes-bottom-line-500-billion/3478235/" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/cybertruth/2013/11/08/cybercrimes-bottom-line-500-billion/3478235/" target="_blank">hundreds of billions</a> of dollars annually.</li>
<li>The market for finding, stockpiling and hoarding (keeping secret) software flaws is expanding rapidly.</li>
<li>Vendor-driven &#8220;bug bounty&#8221; programs which reward researchers for reporting and coordinating the patching of flaws are expanding, but currently do not offer anywhere near the prices offered in the underground or by private buyers.</li>
<li>Software security is a &#8220;negative externality&#8221;: like environmental pollution, vulnerabilities in software impose costs on users and on society as a whole, while software vendors internalize profits and externalize costs. Thus, absent any demand from their shareholders or customers, profit-driven businesses tend not to invest in eliminating negative externalities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier this month, I published a piece called <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/how-many-zero-days-hit-you-today/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/how-many-zero-days-hit-you-today/" target="_blank">How Many Zero-Days Hit You Today</a>, which examined a study by vulnerability researcher <strong>Stefan Frei </strong>about the bustling market for &#8220;zero-day&#8221; flaws &#8212; security holes in software that not even the makers of those products know about. These vulnerabilities &#8212; particularly zero-days found in widely-used software like Flash and Java &#8212; are extremely valuable because attackers can use them to slip past security defenses unnoticed.</p>
<p>Frei&#8217;s analysis conservatively estimated that private companies which purchase software vulnerabilities for use by nation states and other practitioners of cyber espionage provide access to <em>at least 85 zero-day exploits on any given day of the year</em>. That estimate doesn&#8217;t even consider the number of zero-day bugs that may be sold or traded each day in the cybercrime underground.</p>
<p>At the end of that post, I asked readers whether it was possible and/or desirable to create a truly global, independent bug bounty program that would help level the playing field in favor of the defenders and independent security researchers. Frei&#8217;s latest paper outlines one possible answer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BUYING ALL BUGS AT ABOVE BLACK-MARKET PRICES</span></p>
<p>Frei proposes creating a multi-tiered, &#8220;international vulnerability purchase program&#8221; (IVPP), in which the major software vendors would be induced to purchase all of the available and known vulnerabilities at prices well above what even the black market is willing to pay for them. But more on that in a bit.</p>
<p>The director of research for Austin, Texas-based <a title="http://www.nsslabs.com" href="http://www.nsslabs.com" target="_blank">NSS Labs</a>, Frei examined all of the software vulnerabilities reported in 2012, and found that the top 10 software makers were responsible for more than 30 percent of all flaws fixed. Frei estimates that if these vendors were to have purchased information on all of those flaws at a steep price of $150,000 per vulnerability &#8212; an amount that is well above what cybercriminals or vulnerability brokers typically offer for such bugs &#8212; this would still come to less than one percent of the annual revenues for these software firms.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vendorbuyvulncost.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23979" alt="vendorbuyvulncost" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vendorbuyvulncost-600x318.png" width="600" height="318" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vendorbuyvulncost-600x318.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vendorbuyvulncost-285x151.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vendorbuyvulncost.png 754w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Frei points out that the cost of purchasing all vulnerabilities for all products would be considerably lower than the savings that would occur as a result of the expected reduction in losses occurring as a result of cyber crime &#8212; even under the conservative estimate that these losses would be reduced by only 10 percent.</p>
<p>In the above chart, for example, we can see Oracle &#8212; the software vendor responsible for <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=Java&amp;x=-1059&amp;y=-613" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=Java&amp;x=-1059&amp;y=-613" target="_blank">Java</a> and a whole heap of database software code that is found in thousands of organizations &#8212; fixed more than 427 vulnerabilities last year. It also brought in more than $37 billion in revenues that year. If Oracle were to pay researchers top dollar ($150,000) for each vulnerability, that would still come to less than two-tenths of one percent of the company&#8217;s annual revenues (USD $67 million).</p>
<p>Frei posits that if vendors were required to internalize the cost of such a program, they would likely be far more motivated to review and/or enhance the security of their software development processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gdp-globalVSsoft.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23992" alt="gdp-globalVSsoft" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gdp-globalVSsoft-600x169.png" width="600" height="169" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gdp-globalVSsoft-600x169.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gdp-globalVSsoft-285x80.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gdp-globalVSsoft.png 811w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Likewise, Frei said, such a lucrative bug bounty system would virtually ensure that every release of commercial software products would be scrutinized by legions of security experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the short term, it would hit the vendors very badly,&#8221; Frei said in a phone interview with KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;But in the long term, this would produce much more secure software.&#8221;</p>
<div>
<p>&#8220;When you look at new innovations like cars, airplanes and electricity, we see that security and reliability was enhanced tremendously with each as soon as there was independent testing,&#8221; said Frei, an experienced helicopter pilot. &#8220;I was recently reading a book about the history of aviation, and [it noted that in] the first iteration of the NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] it was explicitly stated that when they investigate an accident, if they could not find a mechanical failure, they blamed the pilot. This is what we do now with software: We blame the user. We say, you should have installed antivirus, or done this and that.&#8221;</p>

												<p>An unusual botnet that has ensnared more than 12,500 systems disguises itself as a legitimate add-on for <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> and forces infected PCs to scour Web sites for security vulnerabilities, an investigation by KrebsOnSecurity has discovered.</p>
<p>The botnet, dubbed &#8220;Advanced Power&#8221; by its operators, appears to have been quietly working since at least May 2013. It&#8217;s not clear yet how the initial infection is being spread, but the malware enslaves PCs in a botnet that conducts <a class="lightbox" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection" target="_blank">SQL injection attacks</a> on virtually any Web sites visited by the victim.</p>

<p>SQL injection attacks take advantage of weak server configurations to inject malicious code into the database behind the public-facing Web server. Attackers can use this access to booby-trap sites with drive-by malware attacks, or force sites to cough up information stored in their databases.</p>
<p>Although this malware does include a component designed to steal passwords and other sensitive information from infected machines, this feature does not appear to have been activated on the infected hosts. Rather, the purpose of this botnet seems to be using the compromised Windows desktops as a distributed scanning platform for finding exploitable Web sites. According to the botnet&#8217;s administrative panel, more than 12,500 PCs have been infected, and these bots in turn have helped to discover at least 1,800 Web pages that are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.</p>
<div id="attachment_23960" style="width: 295px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sql-addon.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23960" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-23960" alt="The fraudulent Firefox add-on." src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sql-addon-285x198.png" width="285" height="198" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sql-addon-285x198.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sql-addon.png 516w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-23960" class="wp-caption-text">The fraudulent Firefox add-on.</p></div>
<p>The malicious code comes from sources referenced in <a title="https://malwr.com/analysis/MTI2YzFkODZkNzA0NDVkYTkzNDBmZTg5YjdkMjM3MDA/" href="https://malwr.com/analysis/MTI2YzFkODZkNzA0NDVkYTkzNDBmZTg5YjdkMjM3MDA/" target="_blank">this Malwr writeup</a> and <a title="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/19b523e0db7d612dd439147956589b0c7fe264f1eb183ea3a74565ad20d3cb8a/analysis/1370035125/" href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/19b523e0db7d612dd439147956589b0c7fe264f1eb183ea3a74565ad20d3cb8a/analysis/1370035125/" target="_blank">this Virustotal entry</a> (please don&#8217;t go looking for this malware unless you really know what you&#8217;re doing). On infected systems with Mozilla Firefox installed, the bot code installs a browser plugin called &#8220;Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant&#8221; (this bogus add-on does not appear to be the same thing <a title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/microsoft-net-framework-assist/" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/microsoft-net-framework-assist/" target="_blank">as this add-on by the same name</a>). The malicious add-on then tests nearly every page the infected user visits for the presence of several different SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Holden</strong>, chief information security officer at <a title="http://www.holdsecurity.com" href="http://www.holdsecurity.com" target="_blank">Hold Security LLC</a>, said the botnet appears to have been built to automate the tedious and sometimes blind guesswork involved in probing sites for SQL vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you test an application for SQL injection or any other vulnerability, you have a small frame of reference as to the site&#8217;s functionality,&#8221; Holden said. &#8220;You often don&#8217;t know or can&#8217;t see many user functions. And in some cases you need proper credentials to do it right. In this case, the hackers are using valid requests within many sites that end-users themselves are feeding them. This is a much bigger sample than you would normally get. By no means it is a full regression test, but it is a deep and innovative approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holden said he believes the authors of this botnet may be natives of and/or reside in the Czech Republic, noting that a few transliterated text strings in the malware are auto-detected by Google Translate as Czech.</p>

												<p>Businesses spend billions of dollars annually on software and hardware to block external cyberattacks, but a shocking number of these same organizations shoot themselves in the foot by poking gaping holes in their digital defenses and then advertising those vulnerabilities to attackers. Today&#8217;s post examines an underground service that rents access to hacked PCs at organizations that make this all-too-common mistake.</p>
<p>Makost[dot]net is a service advertised on cybercrime forums which sells access to &#8220;RDPs&#8221;, mainly <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> systems that have been configured (poorly) to accept &#8220;<strong>R</strong>emote <strong>D</strong>esktop <strong>P</strong>rotocol&#8221; connections from the Internet. Windows ships with its own RDP interface built-in; to connect to another Windows desktop or server remotely, simply fire up the <a title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/remote-desktop-connection" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/remote-desktop-connection" target="_blank">Remote Desktop Connection</a> utility in Windows, type in the Internet address of the remote system, and enter the correct username and password for a valid user account on that remote system. Once the connection is made, you&#8217;ll see the remote computer&#8217;s desktop as if you were sitting right in front of it, and have access to all its programs and files.</p>
<div id="attachment_23909" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rdps-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23909" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-23909" alt="Makhost[dot]net sells access to thousands of hacked RDP installations.

Prices range from $3 to $10 based on a variety of qualities, such as the number of CPUs, the operating system version and the PC&#8217;s upload and download speeds.</p></div>
<p>Makost currently is selling access to more than 6,000 compromised RDP installations worldwide. As we can see from the screen shot above, hacked systems are priced according to a combination of qualities of the server:</p>
<ul>
<li>city, state, country of host;</li>
<li>administrative or regular user rights;</li>
<li>operating system version;</li>
<li>number and speed of computer processors;</li>
<li>amount of system memory;</li>
<li>network download and upload speeds;</li>
<li><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank">NAT</a> or direct</li>
</ul>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was given a glimpse inside the account of a very active user of this service, an individual who has paid more than $2,000 over the past six months to purchase some 425 hacked RDPs. I took the Internet addresses in this customer&#8217;s purchase history and ran WHOIS database lookups on them all in a bid to learn more about the victim organizations. As expected, roughly three-quarters of those addresses told me nothing about the victims; the addresses were assigned to residential or commercial Internet service providers.</p>
<p>But the WHOIS records turned up the names of businesses for approximately 25 percent of the addresses I looked up. The largest group of organizations on this list were in the manufacturing (21 victims) and retail services (20) industries. As I sought to categorize the long tail of other victim organizations, I was reminded of the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)" target="_blank">Twelve Days of Christmas carol</a>.</p>
<p>twelve healthcare providers;<br />
ten education providers;<br />
eight government agencies;<br />
seven technology firms;<br />
six insurance companies;<br />
five law firms;<br />
four financial institutions;<br />
three architects;<br />
two real estate firms;<br />
and a forestry company (in a pear tree?)</p>

												<p>Lost in the ongoing media firestorm over the National Security Agency&#8217;s domestic surveillance activities is the discussion about concrete steps to bring the nation&#8217;s communications privacy laws into the 21st Century. Under current laws that were drafted before the advent of the commercial Internet, federal and local authorities can gain access to mobile phone and many email records without a court-issued warrant. In this post, I&#8217;ll explain what federal lawmakers and readers can do to help change the status quo [tl;dr: if you&#8217;d rather skip the explanation and go right to the What Can You Do? section, click <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/help-bring-privacy-laws-into-21st-century/#foot_note_1">here</a>] <strong><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/cloudprivacy.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-23893" alt="cloudprivacy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/cloudprivacy-285x206.jpg" width="285" height="206" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/cloudprivacy-285x206.jpg 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/cloudprivacy.jpg 407w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</strong>, a policy think-tank based in Washington, D.C., has <a title="https://www.cdt.org/issue/wiretap-ecpa" href="https://www.cdt.org/issue/wiretap-ecpa" target="_blank">a concise and informative primer</a> on the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act" target="_blank">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (ECPA), the 1986 statute that was originally designed to protect Americans from Big Brother and from government overreach. Unfortunately, the law is now so outdated that it actually provides legal cover for the <a title="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/5-overlooked-lessons-justice-depts-leak-investigations" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/5-overlooked-lessons-justice-depts-leak-investigations" target="_blank">very sort of overreach it was designed to prevent</a>.</p>
<p>Online messaging was something of a novelty when lawmakers were crafting the ECPA, which gave email moving over the network essentially the same protection as a phone call or postal letter. In short, it required the government to obtain a court-approved warrant to gain access to that information. But the Justice Department wanted different treatment for stored electronic communications. (Bear in mind that this was way before anyone was talking about &#8220;cloud&#8221; storage; indeed CDT notes that electronic storage of digital communications in 1986 was quite expensive, and it wasn&#8217;t unusual for email providers to delete messages that were more than a few months old).</p>
<p>CDT explains the bargain that was struck to accommodate the government&#8217;s concerns:</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress said that after 180 days email would no longer be protected by the warrant standard and instead would be available to the government with a subpoena, issued by a prosecutor or FBI agent without the approval of a judge,&#8221; CDT wrote. &#8220;At the same time, Congress concluded that, while the contents of communications must be highly protected in transit, the &#8216;transactional data&#8217; associated with communications, such as dialing information showing what numbers you are calling, was less sensitive. ECPA allowed the government to use something less than a warrant to obtain this routing and signaling information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast-forward to almost 2014, and we find of course that most people store their entire digital lives &#8220;in the cloud.&#8221; This includes not only email, but calendar data, photos and other sensitive information. Big cloud providers like <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Yahoo!</strong> have given users so much free storage space that hardly anyone has cause to delete their stuff anymore. Not only that, but pretty much everyone is carrying a mobile phone that can be used to track them and paint a fairly detailed account of their daily activities.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s screwy about ECPA: If you&#8217;re the kind of person who stores all that information on your laptop, the government can&#8217;t get at it without a court-ordered warrant. Leave it in the hands of email, mobile and cloud data providers, however, and it&#8217;s relatively easy pickings for investigators.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been an interpretation of the law from the government that says any document stored in the cloud can be accessed with a subpoena, regardless of how old it is,&#8221; said <strong>Mark Stanley</strong>, a communications strategist with CDT. &#8220;The government can access emails over 180 days old with just a subpoena. &#8220;We also know that the [Justice Department] has interpreted the law to say that any emails that are opened — regardless of how old they are — can be accessed without a warrant.&#8221;</p>

												<p><strong>Adobe</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> today each separately released security updates to remedy zero-day bugs and other critical vulnerabilities in their software. Adobe issued fixes for its <strong>Flash</strong> and <strong>Shockwave</strong> players, while Microsoft pushed out 11 updates addressing at least two dozen flaws in <strong>Windows</strong> and other software.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/crackedwin.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-19861" alt="crackedwin" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/crackedwin.png" width="212" height="251" /></a>Five of today&#8217;s 11 update bundles earned Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;critical&#8221; rating, meaning that the vulnerabilities those patches fix can be exploited remotely by malware or miscreants without any help from users. At the top of the priority list for Windows users should be <a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-096" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-096" target="_blank">MS13-096</a>, a patch that plugs a critical zero-day security hole in certain versions of Windows and <strong>Office. </strong>Microsoft <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/11/microsoft-warns-of-zero-day-attack-on-office/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/11/microsoft-warns-of-zero-day-attack-on-office/" target="_blank">first warned about this flaw on Nov. 5</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft also is urging customers and system administrators to prioritize two other critical fixes:  <a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-097" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-097" target="_blank">MS13-097</a>, a cumulative patch for <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> (all versions), and <a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-099" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-099" target="_blank">MS13-099</a>, which fixes a dangerous scripting issue in Windows. All three of these patches fix bugs that Microsoft says are likely to be exploited by attackers in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Ross Barrett</strong>, senior manager of security engineering at <a title="http://www.rapid7.com" href="http://www.rapid7.com" target="_blank">Rapid7</a>, points out a noteworthy patch (<a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-104" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-104" target="_blank">MS13-104</a>) for users of Microsoft Office 2013&#8217;s &#8220;cloud&#8221; services, which apparently fixes another vulnerability that is actively being exploited. &#8220;This information disclosure issue affects the Office &#8216;client&#8217; and could allow an attacker to hijack an authentication token and gain access to documents stored in cloud resources,&#8221; Barrett said.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ADOBE FLASH AND SHOCKWAVE UPDATES</span></p>
<p>Adobe has issued <a title="http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb13-28.html" href="http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb13-28.html" target="_blank">a patch</a> for its Flash Player software that addresses at least two security holes, including a vulnerability that is already under active attack. Adobe said it is aware of reports of an exploit designed to trick the user into opening a Microsoft Word document with malicious Flash (.swf) content. The company credits researcher <strong>Attila Suszter</strong> for reporting the flaw; more information about this bug is available at <a title="http://reversingonwindows.blogspot.com/" href="http://reversingonwindows.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Suszter&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

												<p>Last week, the world got the first glimpses of a man Russian authorities have accused of being &#8220;<strong>Paunch</strong>,&#8221; a computer crime kingpin whose &#8220;Blackhole&#8221; crimeware package has fueled an explosion of cybercrime over the past several years. So far, few details about the 27-year-old defendant have been released, save for some pictures of a portly lad and a list of his alleged transgressions. Today&#8217;s post follows a few clues from recent media coverage that all point to one very likely identity for this young man.</p>
<div id="attachment_23825" style="width: 295px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolst-fido.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23825" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-23825" alt="Dmitry Fedotov from Togliatti, Russia." src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolst-fido-285x225.png" width="285" height="225" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolst-fido-285x225.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolst-fido.png 569w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-23825" class="wp-caption-text">Dmitry Fedotov from Togliatti, Russia.</p></div>
<p>The first story in the Western media about Paunch&#8217;s arrest came on <a title="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/08/cybercrime-arrest-idUSL1N0HY26I20131008" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/08/cybercrime-arrest-idUSL1N0HY26I20131008" target="_blank">Oct. 8, 2013 from Reuters</a>, which quoted an anonymous former Russian police detective.  But the initial news of Paunch&#8217;s arrest appears to have broken on Russian news blogs several days earlier. On Oct. 5, Russian news outlet <a title="http://nesluhi.livejournal.com/565289.html" href="http://nesluhi.livejournal.com/565289.html" target="_blank">neslushi.info</a> posted that a hacker by the name of <strong>Dmitry Fedotov</strong> had been arrested the night before in <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolyatti" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolyatti" target="_blank">Togliatti</a>, a city in Samara Oblast, Russia. The story noted that Fedotov was wanted for creating a program that was used by various organized crime groups to siphon roughly 26 billion rubles (USD $866 million) from unnamed banks. Another <a title="http://samara.ru/read/56437" href="http://samara.ru/read/56437" target="_blank">story from local news site Samara.ru</a> on Oct. 8 references a Dmitry F. from Togliatti.</p>
<p>This is an interesting lead; <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/meet-paunch-the-accused-author-of-the-blackhole-exploit-kit/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/meet-paunch-the-accused-author-of-the-blackhole-exploit-kit/" target="_blank">last week&#8217;s story on Paunch</a> cited information released by Russian forensics firm <strong>Group-IB</strong>, which did not include Paunch&#8217;s real name but said that he resided in Togliatti.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to this past week, and we see out of the Russian publication Vedomosti.ru <a title="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/19787961/policiya-zaderzhala-vseh-soobschnikov-izvestnogo-hakera" href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/19787961/policiya-zaderzhala-vseh-soobschnikov-izvestnogo-hakera" target="_blank">a story stating</a> that Paunch owned his own Web-development company. That story also cited Group-IB saying that Paunch had experience as an advertising manager. <a title="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ff-d3.moikrug.ru%2F%3Fnocookiesupport%3Dyes&amp;sandbox=1" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ff-d3.moikrug.ru%2F%3Fnocookiesupport%3Dyes&amp;sandbox=1" target="_blank">This Yandex profile</a> includes a resume for a Dmitry Fedotov from Togliatti who specializes in Web programming and advertising, and lists &#8220;hack money&#8221; under his &#8220;professional goals&#8221; section. It also states that Fedotov attended the <a title="http://www.tolgas.ru/" href="http://www.tolgas.ru/" target="_blank">Volga State University of Service</a> from 2003-2005.</p>
<p>That Yandex profile for Fedotov says his company is a site called &#8220;<strong>neting.ru</strong>,&#8221; a Web development firm. The current Web site registration records for that domain do not include an owner&#8217;s name, but a historic WHOIS record ordered from <a title="http://www.domaintools.com" href="http://www.domaintools.com" target="_blank">domaintools.com</a> shows that neting.ru was originally registered in 2004 by a <strong>Dmitry E. Fedotov</strong>, using the email addresses <strong>box@neting.ru</strong> and<strong> tolst86@mail.ru</strong>.</p>
<p>A <a title="https://web.archive.org/web/20060209120932oe_/http://neting.ru/about/contacts" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060209120932oe_/http://neting.ru/about/contacts" target="_blank">cached contact page for neting.ru at archive.org</a> shows the same box@neting.ru email address and includes an ICQ instant messenger address, <strong>360022</strong>. According to <a title="http://www.icq.com/people/360022" href="http://www.icq.com/people/360022" target="_blank">ICQ.com</a>, that address belongs to a user who picked the nickname &#8220;<strong>tolst</strong>,&#8221; which roughly translates to &#8220;fatty.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_23837" style="width: 295px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolstporsche.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23837" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-23837" alt="A user who picked the nickname &quot;tolst&quot; or &quot;fatty&quot; posted this image of his new Porsche Cayenne in March 2013" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolstporsche-285x206.png" width="285" height="206" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolstporsche-285x206.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolstporsche-600x435.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tolstporsche.png 1022w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-23837" class="wp-caption-text">A user who picked the nickname &#8220;tolst&#8221; or &#8220;fatty&#8221; posted this image of his new Porsche Cayenne in March 2013</p></div>
<p>This brings up something I want to address from last week&#8217;s story: Some readers said they thought it was insensitive of me to point out that Paunch himself called attention to his most obvious physical trait. But this seems to be a very important detail: Paunch had a habit of picking self-effacing nicknames.</p>
<p>The <a title="http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/790-group-ib-assists-to-suppress-the-activities-of-a-blackhole-exploit-kit-author-paunch-is-arrestedq%22" href="http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/790-group-ib-assists-to-suppress-the-activities-of-a-blackhole-exploit-kit-author-paunch-is-arrestedq%22" target="_blank">pictures of Paunch</a> released by Group-IB show a heavyset young man, and Paunch seems to have picked nicknames that called attention to his size. One email address known to have been used by the Blackhole author was &#8220;paunchik@googlemail.com&#8221; (&#8220;paunchik&#8221; means &#8220;doughnut&#8221; in Russian). Blackhole exploit kit users who <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/02/crimevertising-selling-into-the-malware-channel/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/02/crimevertising-selling-into-the-malware-channel/" target="_blank">wished to place their advertisements in the crimeware kit itsel</a>f so that other customers would see the ads were instructed to pay for the advertisements by sending funds to a Webmoney purse Z356971281174, which is tied to the <a title="https://passport.webmoney.ru/asp/CertView.asp?wmid=561656619879" href="https://passport.webmoney.ru/asp/CertView.asp?wmid=561656619879" target="_blank">Webmoney ID 561656619879</a>; that Webmoney ID uses the alias &#8220;puzan,&#8221; a variant of the Russian word пузо, or &#8220;potbelly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out, &#8220;tolst&#8221; was a common nickname picked by Paunch. We can see a user who picked that same &#8220;tolst&#8221; nickname <a title="http://www.knclub.ru/f/thread28982-3.html" href="http://www.knclub.ru/f/thread28982-3.html" target="_blank">posting in a Russian car forum</a> in March 2013 about his new ride: a white Porsche Cayenne. According to <a title="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PaunchPorche-285x350.png" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PaunchPorche-285x350.png" target="_blank">this photo</a> released by Group-IB, Paunch also owned a white Porsche Cayenne. Tolst posted pictures of the interior of his Porsche <a title="http://www.knclub.ru/f/thread27314.html" href="http://www.knclub.ru/f/thread27314.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

												<p>In early October, news leaked out of Russia that authorities there had arrested and charged the malware kingpin known as &#8220;<strong>Paunch</strong>,&#8221; the alleged creator and distributor of the <strong>Blackhole exploit kit</strong>. Today, Russian police and computer security experts released additional details about this individual, revealing a much more vivid picture of the cybercrime underworld today.</p>
<div id="attachment_23775" style="width: 295px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PaunchPorche.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23775" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-23775" alt="Paunch, the accused creator of the Blackhole Exploit Kit, stands in front of his Porche Cayenne." src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PaunchPorche-285x350.png" width="285" height="350" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PaunchPorche-285x350.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PaunchPorche-600x738.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PaunchPorche.png 682w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-23775" class="wp-caption-text">Paunch, the accused creator of the Blackhole Exploit Kit, stands in front of his Porsche Cayenne.</p></div>
<p>A <a title="http://mvd.ru/news/item/1387267/" href="http://mvd.ru/news/item/1387267/" target="_blank">statement</a> released by the<strong> Russian Interior Ministry </strong>(MVD) &#8212; the entity which runs the police departments in each Russian city &#8212; doesn&#8217;t include Paunch&#8217;s real name, but it says the Blackhole exploit kit creator was arrested in October along with a dozen other individuals who allegedly worked to sell, develop and profit from the crimeware package.</p>
<p>Russian security and forensics firm <a title="http://www.group-ib.com" href="http://www.group-ib.com" target="_blank">Group-IB</a>, which assisted in the investigation, released additional details, including several pictures of the 27-year-old accused malware author. According to Group-IB, Paunch had more than 1,000 customers and was earning $50,000 per month from his illegal activity. The image at right shows Paunch standing in front of his personal car, a Porsche Cayenne.</p>
<p>First spotted in 2010, BlackHole is commercial crimeware designed to be stitched into hacked or malicious sites and exploit a variety of Web-browser vulnerabilities for the purposes of installing malware of the customer&#8217;s choosing. The price of renting the kit ran from $500 to $700 each month. For an extra $50 a month, Paunch<a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/02/crimevertising-selling-into-the-malware-channel/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/02/crimevertising-selling-into-the-malware-channel/" target="_blank"> also rented customers &#8220;crypting&#8221; services</a>; cryptors are designed to obfuscate malicious software so that it remains undetectable by antivirus software.</p>
<div id="attachment_23777" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/paunchy.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23777" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-23777" alt="If the pictured man truly is Paunch, he certainly lived up to his nickname.

<p>Paunch worked with several other cybercriminals to purchase new exploits and security vulnerabilities that could be rolled into Blackhole and help increase the success of the software. Paunch bought the exploits to fund a pricier ($10,000/month) and more exclusive exploit pack called &#8220;Cool Exploit Kit.&#8221;</p>
<p>As documented on this blog in January 2013 (see <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/crimeware-author-funds-exploit-buying-spree/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/crimeware-author-funds-exploit-buying-spree/" target="_blank">Crimeware Author Funds Exploit Buying Spree</a>), Paunch contracted with a third-party exploit broker who announced that he had a $100,000 budget for buying new, previously undocumented <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/how-many-zero-days-hit-you-today/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/how-many-zero-days-hit-you-today/" target="_blank">&#8220;zero-day&#8221; vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
<p>Not long after that story, the individual with whom Paunch worked to purchase those exclusive exploits &#8212; a miscreant who uses the nickname &#8220;<strong>J.P. Morgan</strong>&#8221; &#8212; posted a message to <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=darkode&amp;x=-1067&amp;y=-641" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=darkode&amp;x=-1067&amp;y=-641" target="_blank">the Darkode[dot]com crime forum</a>, stating that he was doubling his exploit-buying budget to $200,000.</p>
<p>In October, shortly after news of Paunch&#8217;s arrest leaked to the media, J.P. Morgan posted to Darkode again, this time more than doubling his previous budget &#8212; to $450,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear ladies and gentlemen! In light of recent events, we look to build a new exploit kit framework. We have budgeted $450,000 to buy vulnerabilities of a browser and its plugins, which will be used only by us afterwards! &#8221;</p>

												<h4>Europol, Microsoft Kneecap Click-Fraud Botnet</h4>
<p>Authorities in Europe joined <strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong> this week in disrupting &#8220;<strong>ZeroAccess</strong>,&#8221; a vast botnet that has enslaved more than two million PCs with malicious software in an elaborate and lucrative scheme to defraud online advertisers.</p>
<p>The action comes partly from Europol&#8217;s <a title="https://www.europol.europa.eu/ec3" href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/ec3" target="_blank">European Cybercrime Center</a> (EC3), as well as law enforcement cybercrime units from Germany, Latvia, Switzerland and the Netherlands, countries that hosted many of the Internet servers used to control the ZeroAccess botnet.</p>
<p>In tandem with the law enforcement moves in Europe, Microsoft filed a civil lawsuit to unmask eight separate cybercriminals thought to be operating the giant botnet, and to block incoming and outgoing communications between infected PCs in the United States and those 18 control servers, according to <a title="https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/notorious-botnet-infecting-2-million-computers-disrupted" href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/notorious-botnet-infecting-2-million-computers-disrupted" target="_blank">a statement released by EC3</a>.</p>
<p>The malware the powers the botnet, also known as &#8220;ZAccess&#8221; and &#8220;Sirefef,&#8221; is a complex threat that has evolved significantly since its inception in 2009. It began as a malware delivery platform that was used to spread other threats, such as fake antivirus software (a.k.a. &#8220;scareware&#8221;).</p>
<p>In recent years, however, the miscreants behind ZeroAccess rearchitected the botnet so that infected systems were forced to perpetrate a moneymaking scheme known as &#8220;click fraud&#8221; &#8212; the practice of fraudulently generating clicks on ads without any intention of fruitfully interacting with the advertiser’s site.</p>
<div id="attachment_23752" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ZAbots.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23752" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-23752" alt="Maps of ZeroAccess infected PCs in Texas. Source: botnetlegalnotice.com" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ZAbots-600x272.png" width="600" height="272" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ZAbots-600x272.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ZAbots-285x129.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ZAbots.png 1017w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-23752" class="wp-caption-text">Maps of ZeroAccess infected PCs in Texas. Source: botnetlegalnotice.com</p></div>
<p>It remains unclear how much this coordinated action will impact the operations of ZeroAccess over the long term. Early versions of ZeroAccess relied on a series of control servers to receive updates, but recent versions of the botnet malware were designed to make the network as a whole more resilient and resistant to targeted takedowns such as the one executed this week.</p>
<p>Specifically, ZeroAccess employs a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture in which new instructions and payloads are distributed from one infected host to another. P2P-based botnets are designed to eliminate a single point of failure, so that if one node used to control the botnet is knocked offline, the remainder of the botnet can still function.</p>
<p>The actions this week appear to have targeted the servers that deliver a specific component of ZeroAccess that gives infected systems new instructions on how to defraud various online advertisers &#8212; including Microsoft. While this effort will not disable the ZeroAccess botnet (the infected systems will likely remain infected), it should allow Microsoft to determine which online affiliates and publishers are associated with the miscreants behind ZeroAccess, since those publishers will have stopped sending traffic directly after the takedown occurred.</p>

												<p>On any given day, nation-states and criminal hackers have access to an entire arsenal of zero-day vulnerabilities  &#8212; undocumented and unpatched software flaws that can be used to silently slip past most organizations&#8217; digital defenses, new research suggests.  That sobering conclusion comes amid mounting evidence that thieves and cyberspies are ramping up spending to acquire and stockpile these digital armaments.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bomb.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-23733" alt="b" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bomb-285x284.jpg" width="285" height="284" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bomb-285x284.jpg 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bomb-150x150.jpg 150w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bomb.jpg 347w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a></p>
<p>Security experts have long suspected that governments and cybercriminals alike are stockpiling zero-day bugs: After all, the thinking goes, if the goal is to exploit these weaknesses in future offensive online attacks, you&#8217;d better have more than a few tricks up your sleeve because it&#8217;s never clear whether or when those bugs will be independently discovered by researchers or fixed by the vendor. Those suspicions were confirmed very publicly in 2010 with the discovery of <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a>, a weapon apparently designed to delay Iran&#8217;s nuclear ambitions and one that relied upon <em>at least four zero-day vulnerabilities</em>.</p>
<p>Documents recently leaked by <strong>National Security Agency</strong> whistleblower Edward Snowden indicate that the NSA <a title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/31/the-nsa-hacks-other-countries-by-buying-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-computer-vulnerabilities/" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/31/the-nsa-hacks-other-countries-by-buying-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-computer-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank">spent more than $25 million </a>this year alone to acquire software vulnerabilities from vendors. But just how many software exploits does that buy, and what does that say about the number of zero-day flaws in private circulation on any given day?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions posed by <strong>Stefan Frei, </strong>research director for Austin, Texas-based <a title="http://www.nsslabs.com" href="http://www.nsslabs.com" target="_blank">NSS Labs</a>. Frei pored over reports from and about some of those private vendors &#8212; including boutique exploit providers like <a title="http://endgame.com/" href="http://endgame.com/" target="_blank">Endgame Systems</a>, <a title="https://www.exodusintel.com/" href="https://www.exodusintel.com/" target="_blank">Exodus Intelligence</a>, <a title="http://www.netragard.com/" href="http://www.netragard.com/" target="_blank">Netragard</a>, <a title="http://revuln.com/" href="http://revuln.com/" target="_blank">ReVuln</a> and <a title="http://www.vupen.com/english/" href="http://www.vupen.com/english/" target="_blank">VUPEN</a> &#8212; and concluded that jointly <em>these firms alone have the capacity to sell more than 100 zero-day exploits per year</em>.</p>
<p>According to Frei, if we accept that the average zero-day exploit persists for about 312 days before it is detected (<a title="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/zero-day-world" href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/zero-day-world" target="_blank">an estimate</a> made by researchers at <strong>Symantec Research Labs</strong>), this means that these firms probably <em>provide access to at least 85 zero-day exploits on any given day of the year</em>. These companies all say they reserve the right to restrict which organizations, individuals and nation states may purchase their products, but they all expressly <em>do not</em> share information about exploits and flaws with the affected software vendors.</p>

<p>That approach stands apart from the likes of <strong>HP TippingPoint</strong>‘s <a href="http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/" target="_blank">Zero-Day Initiative</a> (ZDI) and <strong>Verisign</strong>‘s <a href="http://labs.idefense.com/vcp/" target="_blank">iDefense Vulnerability Contributor Program</a> (VCP), which pay researchers in exchange for the rights to their vulnerability research. Both ZDI and iDefense also manage the communication with the affected vendors, ship stopgap protection for the vulnerabilities to their customers, and otherwise keep mum on the flaws until the vendor ships an update to fix the bugs.</p>
<p>Frei also took stock of the software vulnerabilities collected by these two companies, and found that between 2010 and 2012, the ZDI and VCP programs together published 1,026 flaws, of which 425 (44 percent) targeted flaws in<strong> Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Oracle</strong>, <strong>Sun</strong> and <strong>Adobe</strong> products. The average time from purchase to publication was 187 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;On any given day during these three years, the VCP and ZDI programs possessed 58 unpublished vulnerabilities affecting five vendors, or 152 vulnerabilities total,&#8221; Frei wrote in <a title="https://nsslabs.com/reports/known-unknowns-0" href="https://nsslabs.com/reports/known-unknowns-0" target="_blank">a research paper</a> released today.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vcp-zdi.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23735" alt="vcp-zdi" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vcp-zdi-600x113.png" width="600" height="113" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vcp-zdi-600x113.png 600w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vcp-zdi-285x54.png 285w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/vcp-zdi.png 853w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Frei notes that the VCP and ZDI programs use the information they purchase only for the purpose of building better protection for their customers, and since they share the information with the software vendors in order to develop and release patches, the overall risk is comparatively low. Also, the vulnerabilities collected and reported by VCP and ZDI are not technically zero-days, since one important quality of a zero-day is that it is used in-the-wild to attack targets before the responsible vendor can ship a patch to fix the problem.</p>
<p>In any case, Frei says his analysis clearly demonstrates that critical vulnerability information is available in significant quantities for private groups, for extended periods and at a relatively low cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;So everybody knows there are zero days, but when we talk to C-Level executives, very often we find that these guys don&#8217;t have a clue, because they tell us, &#8216;Yeah, but we’ve never been compromised&#8217;,&#8221; Frei said in an interview.  &#8220;And we always ask them, &#8216;How do you know?'&#8221;</p>

												<p>Point-of-sale (POS) skimmers &#8212; fraud devices made to siphon bank card and PIN data at the cash register &#8212; have grown in sophistication over the years: A few months back, this blog spotlighted <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/02/pro-grade-point-of-sale-skimmer/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/02/pro-grade-point-of-sale-skimmer/" target="_blank">a professionally made point-of-sale skimmer</a> that involved some serious hacking inside the device. Today&#8217;s post examines a comparatively simple but effective POS skimmer that is little more than a false panel which sits atop the PIN pad and above the area where customers swipe their cards.</p>
<p>In scams, as with most things in life, there is a certain elegance in simplicity. This is doubly true with ATM and credit card skimmer scams: The more components and electronics involved, the greater the chance that the fraud devices will malfunction, lose juice, or else be detected too quickly. In fact, some of the most elegant skimming attacks I&#8217;ve seen to date <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/01/atm-skimmers-that-never-touch-the-atm/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/01/atm-skimmers-that-never-touch-the-atm/" target="_blank">never even touched the cash machine</a>, and relied on very basic components.</p>
<p>Recently, I encountered a fraudster selling a remarkably simple but brilliant POS skimming device that can be installed and removed in the blink of an eye. This video, which was produced by a fraudster who sells these devices for thousands of dollars on semi-private underground forums, shows a late-model <strong>Verifone</strong> point-of-sale device retrofitted with a skimmer overlay. The underside of the device (not pictured) includes a tiny battery and flash storage card that allows the fake PIN pad to capture the key presses, and record the data stored on the magnetic stripe of each swiped card.</p>
<div align="center"><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/R_3LlYgPlZc" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>Such a device would be an enticing buy for a crooked employee at a retail store. It might even be installed surreptitiously by thieves posing as customers at a retail establishment. Last month, this blog featured a story about several fraudsters in Florida who did just that, <a title="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/10/nordstrom-finds-cash-register-skimmers/" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/10/nordstrom-finds-cash-register-skimmers/" target="_blank">installing hardware-based register skimmers</a> at Nordstrom department stores while co-conspirators distracted sales personnel.</p>
