												<p>As if the scourge of ransomware wasn&#8217;t bad enough already: Several prominent purveyors of ransomware have signaled they plan to start publishing data stolen from victims who refuse to pay up. To make matters worse, one ransomware gang has now created a public Web site identifying recent victim companies that have chosen to rebuild their operations instead of quietly acquiescing to their tormentors.</p>
<div id="attachment_49997" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49997" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-49997" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mazemaze.png" alt="" width="599" height="62" /><p id="caption-attachment-49997" class="wp-caption-text">The message displayed at the top of the Maze Ransomware public shaming site.</p></div>
<p>Less than 48 hours ago, the cybercriminals behind the Maze Ransomware strain erected a Web site on the public Internet, and it currently lists the company names and corresponding Web sites for eight victims of their malware that have declined to pay a ransom demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Represented here companies dont wish to cooperate with us, and trying to hide our successful attack on their resources,&#8221; the site explains in broken English. &#8220;Wait for their databases and private papers here. Follow the news!&#8221;</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was able to verify that at least one of the companies listed on the site indeed recently suffered from a Maze ransomware infestation that has not yet been reported in the news media.</p>
<p>The information disclosed for each Maze victim includes the initial date of infection, several stolen Microsoft Office, text and PDF files, the total volume of files allegedly exfiltrated from victims (measured in Gigabytes), as well as the IP addresses and machine names of the servers infected by Maze. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/ransomware-gangs-now-outing-victim-businesses-that-dont-pay-up/#more-49994" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The <strong>U.S. Justice Department</strong> this month offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a Russian man indicted for allegedly orchestrating a vast, international cybercrime network that called itself &#8220;<strong>Evil Corp</strong>&#8221; and stole roughly $100 million from businesses and consumers. As it happens, for several years KrebsOnSecurity closely monitored the day-to-day communications and activities of the accused and his accomplices. What follows is an insider&#8217;s look at the back-end operations of this gang.</p>
<div id="attachment_49935" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49935" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-49935" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/yukabets.png" alt="" width="589" height="480" /><p id="caption-attachment-49935" class="wp-caption-text">Image: FBI</p></div>
<p>The $5 million reward is being offered for 32 year-old <strong>Maksim V. Yakubets</strong>, who the government says went by the nicknames &#8220;<strong>aqua</strong>,&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>aquamo</strong>,&#8221; among others. The feds allege Aqua led an elite cybercrime ring with at least 16 others who used advanced, custom-made strains of malware known as &#8220;<strong>JabberZeus</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Bugat</strong>&#8221; (a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Dridex</strong>&#8220;) to steal banking credentials from employees at hundreds of small- to mid-sized companies in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>From 2009 to the present, Aqua&#8217;s primary role in the conspiracy was recruiting and managing a continuous supply of unwitting or <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/08/experienced-money-mule-will-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complicit</a> accomplices to help Evil Corp. launder money stolen from their victims and transfer funds to members of the conspiracy based in Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe. These accomplices, known as &#8220;money mules,&#8221; are typically recruited via work-at-home job solicitations sent out by email and to people who have submitted their resumes to job search Web sites.</p>
<p>Money mule recruiters tend to target people looking for part-time, remote employment, and the jobs usually involve little work other than receiving and forwarding bank transfers. People who bite on these offers sometimes receive small commissions for each successful transfer, but just as often end up getting stiffed out of a promised payday, and/or receiving a visit or threatening letter from law enforcement agencies that track such crime (more on that in a moment).</p>
<h4>HITCHED TO A MULE</h4>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity first encountered Aqua&#8217;s work in 2008 as a reporter for <em>The Washington Post</em>. A source said they&#8217;d stumbled upon a way to intercept and read the daily online chats between Aqua and several other mule recruiters and malware purveyors who were stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars weekly from hacked businesses.</p>
<p>The source also discovered a pattern in the naming convention and appearance of several money mule recruitment Web sites being operated by Aqua. People who responded to recruitment messages were invited to create an account at one of these sites, enter personal and bank account data (mules were told they would be processing payments for their employer&#8217;s &#8220;programmers&#8221; based in Eastern Europe) and then log in each day to check for new messages.</p>
<p>Each mule <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/busywork.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was given busy work or menial tasks</a> for a few days or weeks prior to being asked to handle money transfers. I believe this was an effort to weed out unreliable money mules. After all, those who showed up late for work tended to cost the crooks a lot of money, as the victim&#8217;s bank would usually try to reverse any transfers that hadn&#8217;t already been withdrawn by the mules.</p>
<div id="attachment_49940" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/westernco-r.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49940" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-49940" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/westernco-r.png" alt="" width="593" height="376" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-49940" class="wp-caption-text">One of several sites set up by Aqua and others to recruit and manage money mules.</p></div>
<p>When it came time to transfer stolen funds, the recruiters would send a message through the mule site saying something like: &#8220;Good morning [mule name here]. Our client &#8212; XYZ Corp. &#8212; is sending you some money today. Please visit your bank now and withdraw this payment in cash, and then wire the funds in equal payments &#8212; minus your commission &#8212; to these three individuals in Eastern Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only, in every case the company mentioned as the &#8220;client&#8221; was in fact a small business whose payroll accounts they&#8217;d already hacked into.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it got interesting. Each of these mule recruitment sites had the same security weakness: Anyone <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/avcompanybackoffice.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could register</a>, and after logging in any user could view messages sent to and from all other users simply by changing a number in the browser&#8217;s address bar. As a result, it was trivial to automate the retrieval of messages sent to every money mule registered across dozens of these fake company sites.</p>
<p>So, each day for several years my morning routine went as follows: Make a pot of coffee; shuffle over to the computer and view the messages Aqua and his co-conspirators had sent to their money mules over the previous 12-24 hours; look up the victim company names in Google; pick up the phone to warn each that they were in the process of being robbed by the Russian Cyber Mob.</p>
<p>My spiel on all of these calls was more or less the same: &#8220;You probably have no idea who I am, but here&#8217;s all my contact info and what I do. Your payroll accounts have been hacked, and you&#8217;re about to lose a great deal of money. You should contact your bank immediately and have them put a hold on any pending transfers before it&#8217;s too late. Feel free to call me back afterwards if you want more information about how I know all this, but for now please just call or visit your bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>In many instances, my call would come in just minutes or hours before an unauthorized payroll batch was processed by the victim company&#8217;s bank, and some of those notifications prevented what otherwise would have been enormous losses &#8212; often several times the amount of the organization&#8217;s normal weekly payroll. At some point I stopped counting how many tens of thousands of dollars those calls saved victims, but over several years it was probably in the millions.</p>
<p>Just as often, the victim company would suspect that I was somehow involved in the robbery, and soon after alerting them I would receive a call from an FBI agent or from a police officer in the victim&#8217;s hometown. Those were always interesting conversations. Needless to say, the victims that spun their wheels chasing after me usually suffered far more substantial financial losses (mainly because they delayed calling their financial institution until it was too late).</p>
<p>Collectively, these notifications to Evil Corp.&#8217;s victims led to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/smallbizvictims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of stories over several years</a> about small businesses battling their financial institutions to recover their losses. I don&#8217;t believe I ever wrote about a single victim that wasn&#8217;t okay with my calling attention to their plight and to the sophistication of the threat facing other companies. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/#more-49835" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A top executive at the nonprofit entity responsible for doling out chunks of Internet addresses to businesses and other organizations in Africa has resigned his post following accusations that he secretly operated several companies which sold tens of millions of dollars worth of the increasingly scarce resource to online marketers. The allegations stemmed from a three-year investigation by a U.S.-based researcher whose findings shed light on a murky area of Internet governance that is all too often exploited by spammers and scammers alike.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-49907" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/africa.png" alt="" width="594" height="328" /></p>
<p>There are fewer than four billion so-called &#8220;Internet Protocol version 4&#8221; or IPv4 addresses available for use, but the vast majority of them have already been allocated. The global dearth of available IP addresses has turned them into a commodity wherein each IP can fetch between $15-$25 on the open market. This has led to boom times for those engaged in the acquisition and sale of IP address blocks, but it has likewise emboldened those who specialize in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/05/a-tough-week-for-ip-address-scammers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absconding with</a> and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/feds-allege-adconion-employees-hijacked-ip-addresses-for-spamming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spamming from dormant IP address blocks</a> without permission from the rightful owners.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most dogged chronicler of this trend is California-based freelance researcher <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ron+guilmette" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Guilmette</a>, who since 2016 has been tracking several large swaths of IP address blocks set aside for use by African entities that somehow found their way into the hands of Internet marketing firms based in other continents.</p>
<p>Over the course of his investigation, Guilmette unearthed records showing many of these IP addresses were quietly commandeered from African businesses that are no longer in existence or that were years ago acquired by other firms. Guilmette estimates the current market value of the purloined IPs he&#8217;s documented in this case exceeds USD $50 million.</p>
<p>In collaboration with journalists based in South Africa, Guilmette discovered tens of thousands of these wayward IP addresses that appear to have been sold off by a <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/GPnMw0kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handful of</a> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/amazondigital.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">companies</a> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/amiekholdings.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded by</a> the policy coordinator for <strong>The African Network Information Centre</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFRINIC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AFRINIC</a>), one of the world&#8217;s five regional Internet registries which handles IP address allocations for Africa and the Indian Ocean region.</p>
<p>That individual &#8212; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/eb-pc.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ernest Byaruhanga</strong></a> &#8212; was only the second person hired at AFRINIC back in 2004. Byaruhanga did not respond to requests for comment. However, he abruptly resigned from his position in October 2019 shortly after news of the IP address scheme was <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/internet/318205-the-big-south-african-ip-address-heist-how-millions-are-made-on-the-grey-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first detailed</a> by <strong>Jan Vermeulen</strong>, a reporter for the South African tech news publication <strong>Mybroadband.co.za</strong> who assisted Guilmette in his research.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from AFRINIC&#8217;s new <strong>CEO</strong> <strong>Eddy Kayihura</strong>, who said the organization was aware of the allegations and is currently conducting an investigation into the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the investigation is ongoing, you will understand that we prefer to complete it before we make a public statement,&#8221; Kayihura said. &#8220;Mr. Byauhanga&#8217;s resignation letter did not mention specific reasons, though no one would be blamed to think the two events are related.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/the-great-50m-african-ip-address-heist/#more-49646" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released updates to plug three dozen security holes in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating system and other software. The patches include fixes for seven critical bugs — those that can be exploited by malware or miscreants to take control over a Windows system with no help from users &#8212; as well as another flaw in most versions of Windows that is already being exploited in active attacks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="" width="229" height="240" />By nearly all accounts, the chief bugaboo this month is <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1458</a>, a vulnerability in a core Windows component (Win32k) that is present in Windows 7 through 10 and Windows Server 2008-2019. This bug is already being exploited in the wild, and according to <strong>Recorded Future</strong> the exploit available for it is similar to <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0859" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0859</a>, a Windows flaw reported in April that was found <a href="https://securelist.com/new-win32k-zero-day-cve-2019-0859/90435/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being sold in underground markets</a>.</p>
<p>CVE-2019-1458 is what&#8217;s known as a &#8220;privilege escalation&#8221; flaw, meaning an attacker would need to previously have compromised the system using another vulnerability. Handy in that respect is <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1468" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1468</a>, a similarly widespread critical issue in the Windows font library that could be exploited just by getting the user to visit a hacked or malicious Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Goettl</strong>, director of security at <a href="https://www.ivanti.com/resources/patch-tuesday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivanti</a>, called attention to a curious patch advisory Microsoft released today for <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1489</a>, which is yet another weakness in the <strong>Windows Remote Desktop Protocol</strong> (RDP) client, a component of Windows that lets users view and manage their system from a remote computer. What&#8217;s curious about this advisory is that it applies only to <strong>Windows XP Service Pack 3</strong>, which is no longer receiving security updates.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Exploitability Assessment for Latest Software Release and Older Software Release is 0, which is usually the value reserved for a vulnerability that is known to be exploited, yet the Exploited value was currently set to &#8216;No&#8217; as the bulletin was released today,&#8221; Goettl said. &#8220;If you look at the Zero Day from this month (<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1458" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1458&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576110872132000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0f9W8x_nfgwEUyPH1qfJhF3zreA">CVE-2019-1458</a>) the EA for Older Software Release is &#8216;0 &#8211; Exploitation Detected.&#8217; An odd discrepancy on top of a CVE advisory for an outdated OS. It is very likely this is being exploited in the wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft didn&#8217;t release a patch for this bug on XP, and <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1489" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its advisory on it</a> is about as sparse as they come. But if you&#8217;re still depending on Windows XP for remote access, you likely have bigger security concerns. Microsoft has patched <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=rdp+2019+microsoft+patch&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many critical RDP flaws</a> in the past year. Even <a href="https://blog.netop.com/fbi-recommends-rdp-alternative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FBI last year encouraged users to disable it</a> unless needed, citing flawed encryption mechanisms in older versions and a lack of access controls which make RDP a frequent entry point for malware and ransomware. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/patch-tuesday-december-2019-edition/#more-49895" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>CISO MAG</strong>, a publication dedicated to covering issues near and dear to corporate chief information security officers everywhere, has graciously awarded this author the designation of &#8220;<strong>Cybersecurity Person of the Year</strong>&#8221; in its December 2019 issue.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ciso-cspy.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-49870" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ciso-cspy.png" alt="" width="250" height="334" /></a>KrebsOnSecurity is grateful for the unexpected honor. But I can definitely think of quite a few people who are far more deserving of this title. In fact, if I&#8217;m eligible for any kind of recognition, perhaps &#8220;Bad News Harbinger of the Year&#8221; would be more apt.</p>
<p>As in years past, 2019 featured quite a few big breaches and more than a little public speaking. Almost without fail at each engagement multiple C-level folks will approach after my talk, hand me their business cards and say something like, &#8220;I hope you never have to use this, but if you do please call me first.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken that advice to heart, and now endeavor wherever possible to give a heads up to CISOs/CSOs about a breach <em>before</em> reaching out to the public relations folks. I fully realize that in many cases the person in that role will refer me to the PR department eventually or perhaps immediately.</p>
<p>But on balance, my experience so far is that an initial outreach to the top security person in the organization often results in that inquiry being taken far more seriously. And including this person in my initial outreach makes it much more likely that this individual ends up being on the phone when the company returns my call. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/ciso-magazine-honors-krebsonsecurity/#more-49737" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A Colorado company that specializes in providing IT services to dental offices suffered a ransomware attack that is disrupting operations for more than 100 dentistry practices, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<p>Multiple sources affected say their IT provider, Englewood, Colo. based <a href="https://www.systemconfidence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complete Technology Solutions</a> (CTS), was hacked, allowing a potent strain of ransomware known as <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/07/is-revil-the-new-gandcrab-ransomware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Sodinokibi&#8221; or &#8220;rEvil&#8221;</a> to be installed on computers at more than 100 dentistry businesses that rely on the company for a range of services &#8212; including network security, data backup and voice-over-IP phone service.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-49851" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/dentalsec.png" alt="" width="594" height="355" /></p>
<p>Reached via phone Friday evening, CTS President <strong>Herb Miner</strong> declined to answer questions about the incident. When asked about reports of a ransomware attack on his company, Miner simply said it was not a good time and hung up.</p>
<p>The attack on CTS, which apparently began on Nov. 25 and is still affecting many of its clients, comes little more than two months after <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/ransomware-bites-dental-data-backup-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sodinokibi hit Wisconsin-based dental IT provider PerCSoft</a>, an intrusion that encrypted files for approximately 400 dental practices.</p>
<p>From talking to several companies hit and with third-party security firms called in to help restore systems, it seems that CTS declined to pay an initial $700,000 ransom demand for a key to unlock infected systems at all customer locations.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Terronez</strong>, CEO of Iowa-based <a href="https://www.medixdental.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medix Dental</a>, said he&#8217;s spoken with multiple practices that have been sidelined by the ransomware attack, and that some CTS clients had usable backups of their data available off-site, while others have been working with outside experts to independently negotiate and pay the ransom for their practice only.</p>

												<p>KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/the-iphone-11-pros-location-data-puzzler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran a story this week</a> that puzzled over <strong>Apple</strong>&#8216;s response to inquiries about a potential privacy leak in its new <strong>iPhone 11</strong> line, in which the devices appear to intermittently seek the user&#8217;s location even when all applications and system services are individually set never to request this data. Today, Apple disclosed that this behavior is tied to the inclusion of a short-range technology that lets iPhone 11 users share files locally with other nearby phones that support this feature, and that a future version of its mobile operating system will allow users to disable it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-49815" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iphone11pro.png" alt="" width="598" height="318" /></p>
<p>I published Tuesday&#8217;s story mainly because Apple&#8217;s initial and somewhat dismissive response &#8212; that this was expected behavior and not a bug &#8212; was at odds with its own privacy policy and with its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py0acqg1oKc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent commercials</a> stating that customers should be in full control over what they share via their phones and what their phones share about them.</p>
<p>But in a statement provided today, Apple said the location beaconing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37_3hd_SK24&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I documented in a video</a> was related to <strong>Ultra Wideband</strong> technology that &#8220;provides spatial awareness allowing iPhone to understand its position relative to other Ultra Wideband enabled devices (i.e. all new iPhone 11s, including the Pro and Pro Max).</p>
<p>Ultra-wideband (a.k.a UWB) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-wideband" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a radio technology</a> that uses a very low energy level for short-range, high-bandwidth communications of a large portion of the radio spectrum without interfering with more conventional transmissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;So users can do things like share a file with someone using AirDrop simply by pointing at another user’s iPhone,&#8221; Apple&#8217;s statement reads. The company further explained that the location information indicator (a small, upward-facing arrow to the left of the battery icon) appears because the device periodically checks to see whether it is being used in a handful of countries for which Apple hasn&#8217;t yet received approval to deploy Ultra Wideband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultra Wideband technology is an industry standard technology and is subject to international regulatory requirements that require it to be turned off in certain locations,&#8221; the statement continues. &#8220;iOS uses Location Services to help determine if iPhone is in these prohibited locations in order to disable Ultra Wideband and comply with regulations. The management of Ultrawide Band compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/apple-explains-mysterious-iphone-11-location-requests/#more-49813" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>One of the more curious behaviors of Apple&#8217;s new <strong>iPhone 11 Pro</strong> is that it intermittently seeks the user&#8217;s location information even when all applications and system services on the phone are individually set to never request this data. Apple says this is by design, but that response seems at odds with the company&#8217;s own privacy policy.</p>
<p>The privacy policy available from the iPhone&#8217;s Location Services screen says, &#8220;If Location Services is on, your iPhone will periodically send the geo-tagged locations of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers (where supported by a device) in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to be used for augmenting this crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The policy explains users can disable all location services entirely with one swipe (by navigating to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services, then switching &#8220;Location Services&#8221; to &#8220;off&#8221;). When one does this, the location services indicator &#8212; a small diagonal upward arrow to the left of the battery icon &#8212; no longer appears unless Location Services is re-enabled.</p>
<p>The policy continues: &#8220;You can also disable location-based system services by tapping on System Services and turning off each location-based system service.&#8221; But apparently there are some system services on this model (and possibly <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3437999/iphone-11-vs-iphone-11-prosspecs-features-colors-price.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other iPhone 11 models</a>) which request location data and cannot be disabled by users without completely turning off location services, as the arrow icon still appears periodically even after individually disabling all system services that use location.</p>
<p>On Nov. 13, KrebsOnSecurity contacted Apple to report this as a possible privacy bug in the new iPhone Pro and/or in iOS 13.x, sharing a video showing how the device still seeks the user&#8217;s location when each app and system service is set to &#8220;never&#8221; request location information (but with the main Location Data service still turned on).</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/37_3hd_SK24" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The video above was recorded on a brand new iPhone 11 Pro. The behavior appears to persist in the latest iPhone operating system (iOS 13.2.3) on iPhone 11 Pro devices. A review of Apple&#8217;s support forum indicates other users <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250665845" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are experiencing the same issue</a>. I was not able replicate this behavior on an older model iPhone 8 with the latest iOS.</p>
<p>This week Apple responded that the company does not see any concerns here and that the iPhone was performing as designed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not see any actual security implications,&#8221; an Apple engineer wrote in a response to KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled. <em>The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings&#8221; </em>[emphasis added].</p>
<p>Apple has not yet responded to follow-up questions, but it seems they are saying their phones have some system services that query your location regardless of whether one has disabled this setting individually for all apps and iOS system services.</p>
<p>Granted, the latest versions of iOS give users far more granular control over the sharing of this data <a href="https://appletoolbox.com/why-is-my-iphones-location-services-icon-is-always-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than in the past</a>, especially with respect to third-party apps. And perhaps this oddity is somehow related to <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-certified-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding support for super-fast new WiFi 6 routers</a>, which may have involved the introduction of new hardware.</p>
<p>But it would be nice to know what has changed in the iPhone 11 and why, particularly given Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py0acqg1oKc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent commercials</a> on how they respect user privacy choices &#8212; including location information. This post will be updated in the event Apple provides a more detailed response.</p>
<p><strong>Update, Dec. 5, 2:53 p.m. ET:</strong> Apple disclosed today that this behavior is tied to the inclusion of a new short-range technology that lets iPhone 11 users share files locally with other nearby phones that support this feature, and that a future version of its mobile operating system will allow users to disable it. More information can be found <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/apple-explains-mysterious-iphone-11-location-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this story</a>.</p>

												<p>Many readers probably believe they can trust links and emails coming from U.S. federal government domain names, or else assume there are at least more stringent verification requirements involved in obtaining a <strong>.gov</strong> domain versus a commercial one ending in .com or .org. But a recent experience suggests this trust may be severely misplaced, and that it is relatively straightforward for anyone to obtain their very own .gov domain.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49682" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dotgov.png" alt="" width="596" height="378" /></p>
<p>Earlier this month, KrebsOnSecurity received an email from a researcher who said he got a .gov domain simply by filling out and emailing an online form, grabbing some letterhead off the homepage of a small U.S. town that only has a &#8220;.us&#8221; domain name, and impersonating the town&#8217;s mayor in the application.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used a fake Google Voice number and fake Gmail address,&#8221; said the source, who asked to remain anonymous for this story but who said he did it mainly as a thought experiment. &#8220;The only thing that was real was the mayor&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>
<p>The email from this source was sent from <strong>exeterri[.]gov</strong>, a domain registered on Nov. 14 that at the time displayed the same content as the .us domain it was impersonating &#8212; <a href="https://www.town.exeter.ri.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">town.exeter.ri.us</a> &#8212; which belongs to the town of Exeter, Rhode Island (the impostor domain is no longer resolving).</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to [fill out] &#8216;<a href="https://home.dotgov.gov/registration/authorization-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official authorization form</a>,&#8217; which basically just lists your admin, tech guy, and billing guy,&#8221; the source continued. &#8220;Also, it needs to be printed on &#8216;official letterhead,&#8217; which of course can be easily forged just by Googling a document from said municipality. Then you either mail or fax it in. After that, they send account creation links to all the contacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Technically, what my source did was <a href="https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/wire-fraud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wire fraud</a> (obtaining something of value via the Internet/telephone/fax through false pretenses); had he done it through the U.S. mail, he could be facing <a href="https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/mail-fraud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mail fraud</a> charges if caught.</p>
<p>But a cybercriminal &#8212; particularly a state-sponsored actor operating outside the United States &#8212; likely would not hesitate to do so if he thought registering a .gov was worth it to make his malicious website, emails or fake news social media campaign more believable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never said it was legal, just that it was easy,&#8221; the source said. <span class="pullquote pqright">&#8220;I assumed there would be at least ID verification. The deepest research I needed to do was Yellow Pages records.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Earlier today, KrebsOnSecurity contacted officials in the real town of Exeter, RI to find out if anyone from the <strong>U.S.</strong> <strong>General Services Administration </strong>&#8212; the federal agency responsible for managing the .gov domain registration process &#8212; had sought to validate the request prior to granting a .gov in their name.</p>
<p>A person who called back from the town clerk&#8217;s office but who asked not to be named said someone from the GSA did phone their office on Nov. 24 &#8212; which was four days after I reached out to the federal agency about the domain in question and approximately 10 days after the GSA had already granted the phony request.</p>
<h4>WHO WANTS TO BE A GOVERNMENT?</h4>
<p>Responding today via email, a GSA spokesperson said the agency doesn&#8217;t comment on open investigations.</p>
<p>&#8220;GSA is working with the appropriate authorities and has already implemented additional fraud prevention controls,&#8221; the agency wrote, without elaborating on what those additional controls might be.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity did get a substantive response from the <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong>, a division of the <strong>U.S. Department of Homeland Security</strong> which is leading efforts to protect the federal .gov domain of civilian government networks [NB: The head of CISA, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/person/christopher-c-krebs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher C. Krebs</a>, is of no relation to this author].</p>
<p>The CISA said this matter is so critical to maintaining the security and integrity of the .gov space that DHS is now making a play to assume control over the issuance of all .gov domains.</p>
<p>&#8220;The .gov top-level domain (TLD) is critical infrastructure for thousands of federal, state and local government organizations across the country,&#8221; reads a statement CISA sent to KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;Its use by these institutions should instill trust. In order to increase the security of all US-based government organizations, CISA is seeking the authority to manage the .gov TLD and assume governance from the General Services Administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement continues:</p>
<p>&#8220;This transfer would allow CISA to modernize the .gov registrar, enhance the security of individual .gov domains, ensure that only authorized users obtain a .gov domain, proactively validate existing .gov holders, and better secure everyone that relies on .gov. We are appreciative of Congress’ efforts to put forth the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2749/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOTGOV bill</a> [link added] that would grant CISA this important authority moving forward. GSA has been an important partner in these efforts and our two agencies will continue to work hand-in-hand to identify and implement near-term security enhancements to the .gov.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/its-way-too-easy-to-get-a-gov-domain-name/#more-49517" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>On Nov. 23, one of the cybercrime underground&#8217;s largest bazaars for buying and selling stolen payment card data announced the immediate availability of some four million freshly-hacked debit and credit cards. KrebsOnSecurity has learned this latest batch of cards was siphoned from four different compromised restaurant chains that are most prevalent across the midwest and eastern United States.</p>
<div id="attachment_49658" style="width: 608px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jstashnewworld.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49658" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-49658" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jstashnewworld.png" alt="" width="598" height="554" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-49658" class="wp-caption-text">An advertisement on the cybercrime store Joker&#8217;s Stash for a new batch of ~4 million credit/debit cards stolen from four different restaurant chains across the midwest and eastern United States.</p></div>
<p>Two financial industry sources who track payment card fraud and asked to remain anonymous for this story said the four million cards were taken in breaches recently disclosed by restaurant chains <a href="http://krystal.com/security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Krystal</a>, <a href="https://www.moes.com/paymentcardnotification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moe&#8217;s</a>, <a href="https://www.mcalistersdeli.com/paymentcardnotification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McAlister&#8217;s Deli</a> and <a href="https://www.schlotzskys.com/paymentcardnotification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schlotzsky&#8217;s</a>. Krystal announced a card breach last month. The other three restaurants are all part of the same parent company and disclosed breaches in August 2019.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity heard the same conclusion from <a href="https://geminiadvisory.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini Advisory</a>, a New York-based fraud intelligence company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gemini found that the four breached restaurants, ranked from most to least affected, were Krystal, Moe&#8217;s, McAlister&#8217;s and Schlotzsky&#8217;s,&#8221;  Gemini wrote in an analysis of the New World Order batch shared with this author. &#8220;Of the 1,750+ locations belonging to these restaurants, nearly 50% were breached and had customer payment card data exposed. These breached locations were concentrated in the central and eastern United States, with the highest exposure in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Alabama.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_49662" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/newworldgeo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49662" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-49662" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/newworldgeo.png" alt="" width="594" height="324" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-49662" class="wp-caption-text">McAlister’s (green), Schlotzsky’s (blue), Moe’s (gray), and Krystal (orange) locations across the United States. There is an additional Moe’s location in Hawaii that is not depicted. Image: Gemini Advisory.</p></div>
<p><strong>Focus Brands</strong> (which owns Moe&#8217;s, McAlister&#8217;s, and Schlotzsky&#8217;s) was breached between April and July 2019, and publicly disclosed this on August 23. Krystal claims to have been breached between July and September 2019, and disclosed this in late October.</p>
<p>The stolen cards went up for sale at <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=joker%27s+stash&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the infamous Joker&#8217;s Stash carding bazaar</a>. The most recent big breach marketed on Joker&#8217;s Stash <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/breach-at-hy-vee-supermarket-chain-tied-to-sale-of-5m-stolen-credit-debit-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was dubbed &#8220;Solar Energy,&#8221; and included more than five million cards stolen from restaurants, fuel pumps and drive-through coffee shops operated by Hy-Vee</a>, a supermarket chain based in Iowa.</p>
<p>According to Gemini, Joker&#8217;s Stash likely delayed the debut of the New World Order cards to keep from flooding the market with too much stolen card data all at once, which can have the effect of lowering prices for stolen cards across the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joker&#8217;s Stash first announced their breach on November 11, 2019 and published the data on November 22,&#8221; Gemini found. &#8220;This delay between breaches occurring as early as July and data being offered in the dark web in November appears to be an effort to avoid oversaturating the dark web market with an excess of stolen payment records.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/11/sale-of-4-million-stolen-cards-tied-to-breaches-at-4-restaurant-chains/#more-49648" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
