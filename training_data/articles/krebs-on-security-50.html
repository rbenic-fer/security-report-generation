												<p>Your mobile phone is giving away your approximate location all day long. This isn&#8217;t exactly a secret: It <em>has</em> to share this data with your mobile provider constantly to provide better call quality and to route any emergency 911 calls straight to your location. But now, the major mobile providers in the United States &#8212; <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Sprint</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong> &#8212; are selling this location information to third party companies &#8212; in real time &#8212; without your consent or a court order, and with apparently zero accountability for how this data will be used, stored, shared or protected.</p>
<p>Think about what&#8217;s at stake in a world where <em>anyone</em> can track your location at any time and in real-time. Right now, to be free of constant tracking the only thing you can do is remove the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_identity_module" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIM card</a> from your mobile device never put it back in unless you <em>want</em> people to know where you are.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-43917" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/donthare.png" alt="" width="598" height="103" />It may be tough to put a price on one&#8217;s location privacy, but here&#8217;s something of which you can be sure: The mobile carriers are selling data about where you are at any time, without your consent, to third-parties for probably far less than you might be willing to pay to secure it.</p>
<p>The problem is that as long as anyone but the phone companies and law enforcement agencies with a valid court order can access this data, it is always going to be at extremely high risk of being hacked, stolen and misused.</p>
<p>Consider just two recent examples. Earlier this month <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/cellphone-tracking-law-enforcement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that a little-known data broker named Securus was selling local police forces around the country the ability to look up the precise location of any cell phone across all of the major U.S. mobile networks. Then it emerged that Securus had been hacked, its database of hundreds of law enforcement officer usernames and passwords plundered. We also found out that Securus&#8217; data was ultimately obtained from a California-based location tracking firm <a href="https://www.locationsmart.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LocationSmart</a>.</p>
<p>On May 17, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/tracking-firm-locationsmart-leaked-location-data-for-customers-of-all-major-u-s-mobile-carriers-in-real-time-via-its-web-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the news</a> of research by <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> PhD student <strong>Robert Xiao</strong>, who discovered that a LocationSmart try-before-you-buy opt-in demo of the company&#8217;s technology was <em>wide open</em> &#8212; allowing real-time lookups from anyone on anyone&#8217;s mobile device &#8212; without any sort of authentication, consent or authorization.</p>
<p>Xiao said it took him all of about 15 minutes to discover that LocationSmart&#8217;s lookup tool could be used to track the location of virtually any mobile phone user in the United States.</p>
<p>Securus seems equally clueless about protecting the priceless data to which it was entrusted by LocationSmart. Over the weekend KrebsOnSecurity discovered that someone &#8212; almost certainly a security professional employed by Securus &#8212; has been <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/#/domain/securustech.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploading dozens of emails, PDFs, password lists and other files</a> to <strong>Virustotal.com</strong> &#8212; a service owned by Google that can be used to scan any submitted file against dozens of commercial antivirus tools.</p>
<p>Antivirus companies willingly participate in Virustotal because it gives them early access to new, potentially malicious files being spewed by cybercriminals online. Virustotal users can submit suspicious files of all kind; in return they&#8217;ll see whether any of the 60+ antivirus tools think the file is bad or benign.</p>
<p>One basic rule that all Virustotal users need to understand is that <em>any</em> file submitted to Virustotal is also available to customers who purchase access to the service&#8217;s file repository. Nevertheless, for the past two years someone at Securus has been submitting a great deal of information about the company&#8217;s operations to Virustotal, including copies of internal emails and PDFs about visitation policies at a number of local and state prisons and jails that made up much of Securus&#8217; business.</p>
<div id="attachment_43906" style="width: 607px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/securusfiles-vt.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43906" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-43906" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/securusfiles-vt.png" alt="" width="597" height="611" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-43906" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the many, many files uploaded to Virustotal.com over the years by someone at Securus Technologies.</p></div>
<p>One of the files, submitted on April 27, 2018, is titled &#8220;38k user pass microsemi.com &#8211; joomla_production.mic_users_blockedData.txt&#8221;.  This file includes the names and what appear to be hashed/scrambled passwords of some 38,000 accounts &#8212; supposedly taken from <strong>Microsemi</strong>, a company that&#8217;s been called the largest U.S. commercial supplier of military and aerospace semiconductor equipment.</p>
<p>Many of the usernames in that file do map back to names of current and former employees at Microsemi. KrebsOnSecurity shared a copy of the database with Microsemi, but has not yet received a reply. Securus also has not responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>These files that someone at Securus <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/#/domain/securustech.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apparently submitted regularly to Virustotal</a> also provide <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/securus-observedsubdomains.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something of an internal roadmap of Securus&#8217; business dealings</a>, revealing the names and login pages for several police departments and jails across the country, such as the <a href="https://traviscountyxj.securustech.net/ArchonixXJailSites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travis County Jail site&#8217;s Web page to access Securus&#8217; data</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the screen shot below. Notice that forgot password link there? Clicking that prompts the visitor to enter their username and to select a &#8220;security question&#8221; to answer. There are but three questions: &#8220;What is your pet&#8217;s name? What is your favorite color? And what town were you born in?&#8221; There don&#8217;t appear to be any limits on the number of times one can attempt to answer a secret question.</p>
<div id="attachment_43904" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/travis-secretquestion.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43904" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-43904" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/travis-secretquestion.png" alt="" width="599" height="216" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-43904" class="wp-caption-text">Choose wisely and you, too, could gain the ability to look up anyone&#8217;s precise mobile location.</p></div>
<p>Given such robust, state-of-the-art security, how long do you think it would take for someone to figure out how to reset the password for any authorized user at Securus&#8217; Travis County Jail portal?</p>
<p>Yes, companies like Securus and Location Smart have been careless with securing our prized location data, but why should they care if their paying customers are happy and the real-time data feeds from the mobile industry keep flowing?</p>
<p>No, the real blame for this sorry state of affairs comes down to AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. T-Mobile was the only one of the four major providers that admitted providing Securus and LocationSmart with the ability to perform real-time location lookups on their customers. The other three carriers declined to confirm or deny that they did business with either company. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/mobile-giants-please-dont-share-the-where/#more-43895" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>T-Mobile</strong> is investigating a retail store employee who allegedly made unauthorized changes to a subscriber&#8217;s account in an elaborate scheme to steal the customer&#8217;s three-letter <strong>Instagram</strong> username. The modifications, which could have let the rogue employee empty bank accounts associated with the targeted T-Mobile subscriber, were made even though the victim customer already had taken steps recommended by the mobile carrier to help minimize the risks of account takeover. Here&#8217;s what happened, and some tips on how you can protect yourself from a similar fate.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, KrebsOnSecurity heard from <strong>Paul Rosenzweig</strong>, a 27-year-old T-Mobile customer from Boston who had his wireless account briefly hijacked. Rosenzweig had previously adopted <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/how-to-fight-mobile-number-port-out-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-Mobile&#8217;s advice</a> to customers about blocking mobile number port-out scams, an increasingly common scheme in which identity thieves armed with a fake ID in the name of a targeted customer show up at a retail store run by a different wireless provider and ask that the number to be transferred to the competing mobile company&#8217;s network.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-40415" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/phonefraudsmaller.png" alt="" width="596" height="301" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/phonefraudsmaller.png 609w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/phonefraudsmaller-580x292.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></p>
<p>So-called &#8220;port out&#8221; scams allow crooks to intercept your calls and messages while your phone goes dark. Porting a number to a new provider shuts off the phone of the original user, and forwards all calls to the new device. Once in control of the mobile number, thieves who have already stolen a target&#8217;s password(s) can request any second factor that is sent to the newly activated device, such as a one-time code sent via text message or or an automated call that reads the one-time code aloud.</p>
<p>In this case, however, the perpetrator didn&#8217;t try to port Rosenzweig&#8217;s phone number: Instead, the attacker called multiple T-Mobile retail stores within an hour&#8217;s drive of Rosenzweig&#8217;s home address until he succeeded in convincing a store employee to conduct what&#8217;s known as a &#8220;SIM swap.&#8221;</p>
<p>A SIM swap is a legitimate process by which a customer can request that a new SIM card (the tiny, removable chip in a mobile device that allows it to connect to the provider&#8217;s network) be added to the account. Customers can request a SIM swap when their existing SIM card has been damaged, or when they are switching to a different phone that requires a SIM card of another size.</p>
<p>However, thieves and other ne&#8217;er-do-wells can abuse this process by posing as a targeted mobile customer or technician and tricking employees at the mobile provider into swapping in a new SIM card for that customer on a device that they control. If successful, the SIM swap accomplishes more or less the same result as a number port out (at least in the short term) &#8212; effectively giving the attackers access to any text messages or phone calls that are sent to the target&#8217;s mobile account.</p>
<p>Rosenzweig said the first inkling he had that something wasn&#8217;t right with his phone was on the evening of May 2, 2018, when he spotted an automated email from <strong>Instagram</strong>. The message said the email address tied to the three-letter account he&#8217;d had on the social media platform for seven years &#8212; instagram.com/par &#8212; had been changed. He quickly logged in to his Instagram account, changed his password and then reverted the email on the account back to his original address.</p>
<p>By this time, the SIM swap conducted by the attacker had already been carried out, although Rosenzweig said he didn&#8217;t notice his phone displaying zero bars and no connection to T-Mobile at the time because he was at home and happily surfing the Web on his device using his own wireless network.</p>
<p>The following morning, Rosenzweig received another notice &#8212; this one from <strong>Snapchat</strong> &#8212; stating that the password for his account there (&#8220;p9r&#8221;) had been changed. He subsequently reset the Instagram password and then e<a href="https://support.snapchat.com/a/enable-login-verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nabled two factor authentication on his Snapchat account</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was when I realized my phone had no bars,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;My phone was dead. I couldn&#8217;t even call 611,&#8221; [the mobile short number that all major wireless providers make available to reach their customer service departments].&#8221;</p>
<p>It appears that the perpetrator of the SIM swap abused not only internal knowledge of T-Mobile&#8217;s systems, but also a lax password reset process at Instagram. The social network allows users to enable notifications on their mobile phone when password resets or other changes are requested on the account.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t exactly two-factor authentication because it also lets users reset their passwords via their mobile account by requesting a password reset link to be sent to their mobile device. Thus, if someone is in control of your mobile phone account, they can reset your Instagram password (and probably a bunch of other types of accounts).</p>
<p>Rosenzweig said even though he was able to reset his Instagram password and restore his old email address tied to the account, the damage was already done: All of his images and other content he&#8217;d shared on Instagram over the years was still tied to his account, but the attacker had succeeded in stealing his &#8220;par&#8221; username, leaving him with a slightly less sexy &#8220;par54384321,&#8221; (apparently chosen for him at random by either Instagram or the attacker). <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/t-mobile-employee-made-unauthorized-sim-swap-to-steal-instagram-account/#more-43654" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>LocationSmart</strong>, a U.S. based company that acts as an aggregator of real-time data about the precise location of mobile phone devices, has been leaking this information to anyone via a buggy component of its Web site &#8212; <em>without the need for any password or other form of authentication or authorization</em> &#8212; KrebsOnSecurity has learned. The company took the vulnerable service offline early this afternoon after being contacted by KrebsOnSecurity, which verified that it could be used to reveal the location of any <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Sprint</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> or <strong>Verizon</strong> phone in the United States to an accuracy of within a few hundred yards.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43845" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/locationtracking.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="324" /></p>
<p>On May 10, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/cellphone-tracking-law-enforcement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the news</a> that a different cell phone location tracking company called <strong>Securus Technologies</strong> had been selling or giving away location data on customers of virtually any major mobile network provider to a sheriff&#8217;s office in Mississippi County, Mo.</p>
<p>On May 15, <em>ZDnet.com</em> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-cell-carriers-selling-access-to-real-time-location-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran a piece</a> saying that Securus was getting its data through an intermediary &#8212; Carlsbad, CA-based LocationSmart.</p>
<p>Wednesday afternoon <em>Motherboard</em> <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gykgv9/securus-phone-tracking-company-hacked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published another bombshell</a>: A hacker had broken into the servers of Securus and stolen 2,800 usernames, email addresses, phone numbers and hashed passwords of authorized Securus users. Most of the stolen credentials reportedly belonged to law enforcement officers across the country &#8212; stretching from 2011 up to this year.</p>
<p>Several hours before the Motherboard story went live, KrebsOnSecurity heard from <strong>Robert Xiao</strong>, a security researcher at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> who&#8217;d read the coverage of Securus and LocationSmart and had been poking around a demo tool that LocationSmart makes available on its Web site for potential customers to try out its mobile location technology.</p>
<p>LocationSmart&#8217;s demo is a free service that allows anyone to see the approximate location of their own mobile phone, just by entering their name, email address and phone number into a form on the site. LocationSmart then texts the phone number supplied by the user and requests permission to ping that device&#8217;s nearest cellular network tower.</p>
<p>Once that consent is obtained, LocationSmart texts the subscriber their approximate longitude and latitude, plotting the coordinates on a Google Street View map. [It also potentially collects and stores a great deal of technical data about your mobile device. For example, according to their <a href="https://www.locationsmart.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a> that information &#8220;may include, but is not limited to, device latitude/longitude, accuracy, heading, speed, and altitude, cell tower, Wi-Fi access point, or IP address information&#8221;].</p>
<p>But according to <strong>Xiao</strong>, a PhD candidate at <b>CMU&#8217;s</b> <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/robert-xiao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>, this same service failed to perform basic checks to prevent anonymous and unauthorized queries. Translation: Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about how Web sites work could abuse the LocationSmart demo site to figure out how to conduct mobile number location lookups at will, <em>all without ever having to supply a password or other credentials</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stumbled upon this almost by accident, and it wasn&#8217;t terribly hard to do,&#8221; Xiao said. &#8220;This is something anyone could discover with minimal effort. And the gist of it is I can track most peoples&#8217; cell phone without their consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xiao said his tests showed he could reliably query LocationSmart&#8217;s service to ping the cell phone tower closest to a subscriber&#8217;s mobile device. Xiao said he checked the mobile number of a friend several times over a few minutes while that friend was moving and found he was then able to plug the coordinates into <a href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a> and track the friend&#8217;s directional movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is really creepy stuff,&#8221; Xiao said, adding that he&#8217;d also successfully tested the vulnerable service against one <strong>Telus</strong> <strong>Mobility</strong> mobile customer in Canada who volunteered to be found.</p>
<p>Before LocationSmart&#8217;s demo was taken offline today, KrebsOnSecurity pinged five different trusted sources, all of whom gave consent to have Xiao determine the whereabouts of their cell phones. Xiao was able to determine within a few seconds of querying the public LocationSmart service the near-exact location of the mobile phone belonging to all five of my sources.</p>
<div id="attachment_43840" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43840" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-43840" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lsmartdemo.png" alt="" width="596" height="468" /><p id="caption-attachment-43840" class="wp-caption-text">LocationSmart&#8217;s demo page.</p></div>
<p>One of those sources said the longitude and latitude returned by Xiao&#8217;s queries <em>came within 100 yards of their then-current location</em>. Another source said the location found by the researcher was 1.5 miles away from his current location. The remaining three sources said the location returned for their phones was between approximately 1/5 to 1/3 of a mile at the time.</p>
<p>Reached for comment via phone, LocationSmart Founder and CEO <strong>Mario Proietti</strong> said the company was investigating.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t give away data,&#8221; Proietti said. &#8220;We make it available for legitimate and authorized purposes. It&#8217;s based on legitimate and authorized use of location data that only takes place on consent. We take privacy seriously and we&#8217;ll review all facts and look into them.&#8221;</p>
<p>LocationSmart&#8217;s home page features the corporate logos of all four the major wireless providers, as well as companies like <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Neustar</strong>, <strong>ThreatMetrix</strong>, and <strong>U.S. Cellular</strong>. The company says its technologies help businesses keep track of remote employees and corporate assets, and that it helps mobile advertisers and marketers serve consumers with &#8220;geo-relevant promotions.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_43843" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43843" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-43843" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ls-customers.png" alt="" width="593" height="366" /><p id="caption-attachment-43843" class="wp-caption-text">LocationSmart&#8217;s home page lists many partners.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly how long LocationSmart has offered its demo service or for how long the service has been so permissive; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106095744/https://www.locationsmart.com/resources#demos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link from archive.org</a> suggests it dates back to at least January 2017. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110628000743/https://instantlocatedemo.loc-aid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This link from The Internet Archive</a> suggests the service may have existed under a different company name &#8212; loc-aid.com &#8212; since mid-2011, but it&#8217;s unclear if that service used the same code. Loc-aid.com is one of four other sites hosted on the same server as locationsmart.com, according to <a href="https://www.domaintools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domaintools.com</a>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/tracking-firm-locationsmart-leaked-location-data-for-customers-of-all-major-u-s-mobile-carriers-in-real-time-via-its-web-site/#more-43823" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Much of the fraud involving counterfeit credit, ATM debit and retail gift cards relies on the ability of thieves to use cheap, widely available hardware to encode stolen data onto any card&#8217;s magnetic stripe. But new research suggests retailers and ATM operators could reliably detect counterfeit cards using a simple technology that flags cards which appear to have been altered by such tools.</p>
<div id="attachment_43797" style="width: 307px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43797" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-43797" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/giftcard.png" alt="" width="297" height="212" /><p id="caption-attachment-43797" class="wp-caption-text">A gift card purchased at retail with an unmasked PIN hidden behind a paper sleeve. Such PINs can be easily copied by an adversary, who waits until the card is purchased to steal the card’s funds. Image: University of Florida.</p></div>
<p>Researchers at the <strong>University of Florida</strong> found that account data encoded on legitimate cards is invariably written using quality-controlled, automated facilities that tend to imprint the information in uniform, consistent patterns.</p>
<p>Cloned cards, however, usually are created by hand with inexpensive encoding machines, and as a result feature far more variance or &#8220;jitter&#8221; in the placement of digital bits on the card&#8217;s stripe.</p>
<p>Gift cards can be extremely profitable and brand-building for retailers, but gift card fraud creates a very negative shopping experience for consumers and a costly conundrum for retailers. The FBI estimates that while gift card fraud makes up a small percentage of overall gift card sales and use, approximately $130 billion worth of gift cards are sold each year.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms of gift card fraud involves thieves tampering with cards inside the retailer&#8217;s store &#8212; before the cards are purchased by legitimate customers. Using a handheld card reader, crooks will swipe the stripe to record the card&#8217;s serial number and other data needed to duplicate the card.</p>
<p>If there is a PIN on the gift card packaging, the thieves record that as well. In many cases, the PIN is obscured by a scratch-off decal, but gift card thieves can easily scratch those off and then replace the material with identical or similar decals that are sold very cheaply by the roll online.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can buy big rolls of that online for almost nothing,&#8221; said <strong><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~traynor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Traynor</a></strong>, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Florida. &#8220;Retailers we&#8217;ve worked with have told us they&#8217;ve gone to their gift card racks and found tons of this scratch-off stuff on the ground near the racks.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point the cards are still worthless because they haven&#8217;t yet been activated. But armed with the card&#8217;s serial number and PIN, thieves can simply monitor the gift card account at the retailer&#8217;s online portal and wait until the cards are paid for and activated at the checkout register by an unwitting shopper.</p>
<p>Once a card is activated, thieves can encode that card&#8217;s data onto any card with a magnetic stripe and use that counterfeit to purchase merchandise at the retailer. The stolen goods typically are then sold online or on the street. Meanwhile, the person who bought the card (or the person who received it as a gift) finds the card is drained of funds when they eventually get around to using it at a retail store.</p>
<div id="attachment_41972" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41972" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-41972" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/giftcardtamper.png" alt="" width="590" height="583" /><p id="caption-attachment-41972" class="wp-caption-text">The top two gift cards show signs that someone previously peeled back the protective sticker covering the redemption code. Image: Flint Gatrell.</p></div>
<p>Traynor and a team of five other University of Florida researchers partnered with retail giant <strong>WalMart</strong> to test their technology, which Traynor said can be easily and quite cheaply incorporated into point-of-sale systems at retail store cash registers. They said the WalMart trial demonstrated that researchers&#8217; technology distinguished legitimate gift cards from clones with up to 99.3 percent accuracy.</p>
<p>While impressive, that rate still means the technology could still generate a &#8220;false positive&#8221; &#8212; erroneously flagging a legitimate customer as using a fraudulently obtained gift card in a non-trivial number of cases. But Traynor said the retailers they spoke with in testing their equipment all indicated they would welcome any additional tools to curb the incidence of gift card fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve talked with quite a few retail loss prevention folks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most said even if they can simply flag the transaction and make a note of the person [presenting the cloned card] that this would be a win for them. Often, putting someone on notice that loss prevention is watching is enough to make them stop &#8212; at least at that store. From our discussions with a few big-box retailers, this kind of fraud is probably their newest big concern, although they don&#8217;t talk much about it publicly. If the attacker does any better than simply cloning the card to a blank white card, they&#8217;re pretty much powerless to stop the attack, and that&#8217;s a pretty consistent story behind closed doors.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/detecting-cloned-cards-at-the-atm-register/#more-43782" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>I spent a few days last week speaking at and attending a conference on responding to identity theft. The forum was held in Florida, one of the major epicenters for identity fraud complaints in United States. One gripe I heard from several presenters was that identity thieves increasingly are finding ways to open new mobile phone accounts in the names of people who have already frozen their credit files with the big-three credit bureaus. Here&#8217;s a look at what may be going on, and how you can protect yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Carrie Kerskie</strong> is director of the <a href="https://www.hodges.edu/identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identity Fraud Institute</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodges_University" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hodges University</a> in Naples. A big part of her job is helping local residents respond to identity theft and fraud complaints. Kerskie said she&#8217;s had multiple victims in her area recently complain of having cell phone accounts opened in their names even though they had already <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/06/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-the-security-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frozen their credit files at the big three credit bureaus</a> &#8212; <strong>Equifax</strong>, <strong>Experian</strong> and <strong>Trans Union</strong> (as well as distant fourth bureau <strong>Innovis</strong>).</p>
<p>The freeze process is designed so that a creditor should not be able to see your credit file unless you unfreeze the account. A credit freeze blocks potential creditors from being able to view or “pull” your credit file, making it far more difficult for identity thieves to apply for new lines of credit in your name.</p>
<p>But Kerskie&#8217;s investigation revealed that the mobile phone merchants weren&#8217;t asking any of the four credit bureaus mentioned above. Rather, the mobile providers were making credit queries with the <strong>National Consumer Telecommunications and Utilities Exchange</strong> (NCTUE), or <a href="http://www.nctue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nctue.com</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re finding that a lot of phone carriers &#8212; even some of the larger ones &#8212; are relying on NCTUE for credit checks,&#8221; Kerskie said. &#8220;It&#8217;s mainly phone carriers, but utilities, power, water, cable, any of those, they&#8217;re all starting to use this more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NCTUE is a consumer reporting agency founded by <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> in 1997 that maintains data such as payment and account history, reported by telecommunication, pay TV and utility service providers that are members of NCTUE.</p>
<p>Who are the NCTUE&#8217;s members? If you call the 800-number that NCTUE makes available to get a free copy of your NCTUE credit report, the option for &#8220;more information&#8221; about the organization says there are four &#8220;exchanges&#8221; that feed into the NCTUE&#8217;s system: the NCTUE itself; something called &#8220;<strong>Centralized Credit Check Systems</strong>&#8220;; the <strong>New York Data Exchange</strong>; and the <strong>California Utility Exchange</strong>.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www22.verizon.com/wholesale/local/billing/content/access-to-customer-credit-info-for-verizon-north-west.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner solutions page at <strong>Verizon</strong>,</a> the New York Data Exchange is a not-for-profit entity created in 1996 that provides participating exchange carriers with access to local telecommunications service arrears (accounts that are unpaid) and final account information on residential end user accounts.</p>
<p>The NYDE is operated by <strong>Equifax Credit Information Services Inc. </strong>(yes, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-what-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>that</em> Equifax</a>). Verizon is one of many telecom providers that use the NYDE (and recall that AT&amp;T was the founder of NCTUE).</p>
<p>The California Utility Exchange collects customer payment data from dozens of local utilities in the state, and also is operated by Equifax (<strong>Equifax Information Services LLC</strong>).</p>
<p>Google has virtually no useful information available about an entity called Centralized Credit Check Systems. It&#8217;s possible it no longer exists. If anyone finds differently, please leave a note in the comments section.</p>
<p>When I did some more digging on the NCTUE, I discovered&#8230;wait for it&#8230;Equifax <em>also is the sole contractor that manages the NCTUE database.</em> The entity&#8217;s site is also hosted out of Equifax&#8217;s servers. Equifax&#8217;s current contract to provide this service expires in 2020, according to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-and-nctue-expand-services-agreement-through-2020-300164903.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a press release</a> posted in 2015 by Equifax. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/another-credit-freeze-target-nctue-com/#more-43713" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released a bundle of security updates to fix at least 67 holes in its various <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and related software, including one dangerous flaw that Microsoft warns is actively being exploited. Meanwhile, as it usually does on Microsoft&#8217;s Patch Tuesday &#8212; the second Tuesday of each month &#8212; <strong>Adobe</strong> has a new <strong>Flash Player</strong> update that addresses a single but critical security weakness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-18875" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/brokenflash-a.png" alt="" width="211" height="180" />First, the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb18-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flash Tuesday update</a>, which brings Flash Player to v. <em>29.0.0.171</em>. Some (present company included) would argue that Flash Player is itself &#8220;a single but critical security weakness.&#8221; Nevertheless, <strong>Google Chrome</strong> and <strong>Internet Explorer/Edge</strong> ship with their own versions of Flash, which get updated automatically when new versions of these browsers are made available.</p>
<p>You can check if your browser has Flash installed/enabled and what version it&#8217;s at by pointing your browser at <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>. Adobe is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/flash-player-is-dead-long-live-flash-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phasing out Flash entirely by 2020</a>, but most of the major browsers already take steps to hobble Flash. And with good reason: It’s a major security liability. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/microsoft-patch-tuesday-may-2018-edition/#more-43750" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monster distributed denial-of-service attack</a> (DDoS) against KrebsOnSecurity.com in 2016 <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knocked this site offline for nearly four days</a>. The attack was executed through a network of hacked &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices such as Internet routers, security cameras and digital video recorders. A new study that tries to measure the direct cost of that one attack for IoT device users whose machines were swept up in the assault found that it may have cost device owners a total of $323,973.75 in excess power and added bandwidth consumption.</p>
<p>My bad.</p>
<p>But really, none of it was my fault at all. It was mostly the fault of IoT makers for shipping cheap, poorly designed products (insecure by default), and the fault of customers who bought these IoT things and plugged them onto the Internet without changing the things&#8217; factory settings (passwords at least.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43692" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ddo.png" alt="" width="379" height="123" /></p>
<p>The botnet that hit my site in Sept. 2016 was powered by the first version of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=mirai&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirai</a>, a malware strain that wriggles into dozens of IoT devices left exposed to the Internet and running with factory-default settings and passwords. Systems infected with Mirai are forced to scan the Internet for other vulnerable IoT devices, but they&#8217;re just as often used to help launch punishing DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>By the time of the first Mirai attack on this site, the young masterminds behind Mirai <em>had already enslaved more than 600,000 IoT devices for their DDoS armies</em>. But according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with one of the admitted</a> and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/mirai-iot-botnet-co-authors-plead-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convicted co-authors</a> of Mirai, the part of their botnet that pounded my site was a mere slice of firepower they&#8217;d sold for a few hundred bucks to a willing buyer. The attack army sold to this ne&#8217;er-do-well harnessed the power of just 24,000 Mirai-infected systems (mostly security cameras and DVRs, but some routers, too).</p>
<p>These 24,000 Mirai devices clobbered my site for several days with data blasts of up to 620 Gbps. The attack was so bad that my pro-bono DDoS protection provider at the time &#8212; <strong>Akamai</strong> &#8212; had to let me go because <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/11/akamai-on-the-record-krebsonsecurity-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data firehose pointed at my site</a> was starting to cause real pain for their paying customers. Akamai later estimated that the cost of maintaining protection against my site in the face of that onslaught would have run into the millions of dollars.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re getting better at figuring out the financial costs of DDoS attacks to the victims (5, 6 or 7 -digit dollar losses) and to the perpetrators (zero to hundreds of dollars). According to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123005628/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> released this year by DDoS mitigation giant <strong>NETSCOUT Arbor</strong>, fifty-six percent of organizations last year experienced a financial impact from DDoS attacks for between $10,000 and $100,000, almost double the proportion from 2016.</p>
<p>But what if there were also a way to work out the cost of these attacks to the users of the IoT devices which get snared by DDos botnets like Mirai? That&#8217;s what researchers at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of California, Berkeley</a> <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School of Information</a> sought to determine in their new paper, &#8220;<a href="https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rIoT: Quantifying Consumer Costs of Insecure Internet of Things Devices.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>If we accept the UC Berkeley team&#8217;s assumptions about costs borne by hacked IoT device users (more on that in a bit), the total cost of added bandwidth and energy consumption from the botnet that hit my site came to $323,973.95. This may sound like a lot of money, but remember that broken down among 24,000 attacking drones the per-device cost comes to just $13.50.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s review: The attacker who wanted to clobber my site paid a few hundred dollars to rent a tiny portion of a much bigger Mirai crime machine. That attack would likely have cost millions of dollars to mitigate. The consumers in possession of the IoT devices that did the attacking probably realized a few dollars in losses each, if that. Perhaps forever unmeasured are the many Web sites and Internet users whose connection speeds are often collateral damage in DDoS attacks.</p>

												<p><strong>Twitter</strong> just asked all 300+ million users to reset their passwords, citing the exposure of user passwords via a bug that stored passwords in plain text &#8212; without protecting them with any sort of encryption technology that would mask a Twitter user&#8217;s true password. The social media giant says it has fixed the bug and that so far its investigation hasn&#8217;t turned up any signs of a breach or that anyone misused the information. But if you have a Twitter account, please <a href="https://twitter.com/account/begin_password_reset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change your account password now</a>.</p>
<p>Or if you don&#8217;t trust links in blogs like this (I get it) go to Twitter.com and change it from there. And then come back and read the rest of this. We&#8217;ll wait.</p>
<p>In a post to its company blog this afternoon, <strong>Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal</strong> wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;When you set a password for your Twitter account, we use technology that masks it so no one at the company can see it. We recently identified a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log. We have fixed the bug, and our investigation shows no indication of breach or misuse by anyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you consider changing your password on all services where you’ve used this password. You can change your Twitter password anytime by going to the password settings page.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/twitter-to-all-users-change-your-password-now/#more-43628" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Storing passwords in plaintext online is never a good idea, but it&#8217;s remarkable how many companies have employees who are doing just that using online collaboration tools like <strong>Trello.com</strong>. Last week, KrebsOnSecurity notified a host of companies that employees were using Trello to share passwords for sensitive internal resources. Among those put at risk by such activity included an insurance firm, a state government agency and ride-hailing service <strong>Uber</strong>.</p>
<p>By default, Trello boards for both enterprise and personal use are set to either private (requires a password to view the content) or team-visible only (approved members of the collaboration team can view).</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t stop individual Trello users from manually sharing personal boards that include proprietary employer data, information that may be indexed by search engines and available to anyone with a Web browser. And unfortunately for organizations, far too many employees are posting sensitive internal passwords and other resources on their own personal Trello boards that are left open and exposed online.</p>
<div id="attachment_43594" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/uber-red.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43594" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-43594" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/uber-red.png" alt="" width="599" height="318" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-43594" class="wp-caption-text">A personal Trello board created by an Uber employee included passwords that might have exposed sensitive internal company operations.</p></div>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity spent the past week using Google to discover unprotected personal Trello boards that listed employer passwords and other sensitive data. Pictured above was a personal board set up by some Uber developers in the company&#8217;s Asia-Pacific region, which included passwords needed to view a host of internal Google Documents and images.</p>
<p>Uber spokesperson <strong>Melanie Ensign</strong> said the Trello board in question was made private shortly after being notified by this publication, among others. Ensign said Uber found the unauthorized Trello board exposed information related to two users in South America who have since been notified. </p>
<p>&#8220;We had a handful of members in random parts of the world who didn&#8217;t realize they were openly sharing this information,&#8221; Ensign said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve reached out to these teams to remind people that these things need to happen behind internal resources. Employee awareness is an ongoing challenge, We may have dodged a bullet here, and it definitely could have been worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ensign said the initial report about the exposed board came through <a href="https://hackerone.com/uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company&#8217;s bug bounty program</a>, and that the person who reported it would receive at least the minimum bounty amount &#8212; $500 &#8212; for reporting the incident (Uber hasn&#8217;t yet decided whether the award should be higher for this incident).</p>
<p>The Uber employees who created the board &#8220;used their work email to open a public board that they weren&#8217;t supposed to,&#8221; Ensign said. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t go through our enterprise account to create that. We first found out about it through our bug bounty program, and while it&#8217;s not technically a vulnerability in our products, it&#8217;s certainly something that we would pay for anyway. In this case, we got multiple reports about the same thing, but we always pay the first report we get.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, not every company has a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and private reporting of internal resources that may be inadvertently exposed online.</p>
<p>Screenshots that KrebsOnSecurity took of many far more shocking examples of employees posting dozens of passwords for sensitive internal resources are not pictured here because the affected parties still have not responded to alerts provided by this author.<br />

												<p>On <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/who-is-afraid-of-more-spams-and-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two</a> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/new-eu-privacy-law-may-weaken-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">occasions</a> this past year I&#8217;ve published stories here warning about the prospect that new European privacy regulations could result in more spams and scams ending up in your inbox. This post explains in a question and answer format some of the reasoning that went into that prediction, and responds to many of the criticisms leveled against it.</p>
<p>Before we get to the Q&amp;A, a bit of background is in order. On May 25, 2018 the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) takes effect. The law, enacted by the European Parliament, requires companies to get affirmative consent for any personal information they collect on people within the European Union. Organizations that violate the GDPR could face fines of <em>up to four percent of global annual revenues</em>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-42559" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/whois.png" alt="" width="598" height="118" /></p>
<p>In response, the <a href="https://www.icann.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (ICANN) — the nonprofit entity that manages the global domain name system — has proposed redacting key bits of personal data from WHOIS, the system for querying databases that store the registered users of domain names and blocks of Internet address ranges (IP addresses).</p>
<p>Under current ICANN rules, domain name registrars should collect and display a variety of data points when someone performs a WHOIS lookup on a given domain, such as the registrant’s name, address, email address and phone number. Most registrars offer a privacy protection service that shields this information from public WHOIS lookups; some registrars charge a nominal fee for this service, while others offer it for free.</p>
<p>But in a bid to help registrars comply with the GDPR, ICANN is moving forward on a plan to remove critical data elements from all public WHOIS records. Under the new system, registrars would collect all the same data points about their customers, yet limit how much of that information is made available via public WHOIS lookups.</p>
<p>The data to be redacted includes the name of the person who registered the domain, as well as their phone number, physical address and email address. The new rules would apply to all domain name registrars globally.</p>
<p>ICANN has proposed creating an “accreditation system” that would vet access to personal data in WHOIS records for several groups, including journalists, security researchers, and law enforcement officials, as well as intellectual property rights holders who routinely use WHOIS records to combat piracy and trademark abuse.</p>
<p>But at <a href="https://61.schedule.icann.org/meetings/647709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ICANN meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico</a> last month, ICANN representatives conceded that a proposal for how such a vetting system might work probably would not be ready until December 2018. Assuming ICANN meets that deadline, it could be many months after that before the hundreds of domain registrars around the world take steps to adopt the new measures.</p>
<p>In a series of posts on Twitter, I <a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/981735118648889345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that the WHOIS changes coming with GDPR will likely result in a noticeable increase in cybercrime &#8212; particularly in the form of phishing and other types of spam. In response to those tweets, several authors on Wednesday published an article for Georgia Tech&#8217;s <strong>Internet Governance Project</strong> titled, <a href="https://www.internetgovernance.org/2018/04/25/whois-afraid-dark-truth-illusion-lets-know-difference-comes-whois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;WHOIS afraid of the dark? Truth or illusion, let&#8217;s know the difference when it comes to WHOIS.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The following Q&amp;A is intended to address many of the more misleading claims and assertions made in that article.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber criminals don&#8217;t use their real information in WHOIS registrations, so what&#8217;s the big deal if the data currently available in WHOIS records is no longer in the public domain after May 25?</strong></p>
<p>I can point to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=domaintools&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of stories printed here</a> &#8212; and probably hundreds elsewhere &#8212; that clearly demonstrate otherwise. Whether or not cyber crooks do provide their real information is beside the point. ANY information they provide &#8212; and especially information that they re-use across multiple domains and cybercrime campaigns &#8212; is invaluable to both grouping cybercriminal operations and in ultimately identifying who&#8217;s responsible for these activities.</p>
<p>To understand why data reuse in WHOIS records is so common among crooks, put yourself in the shoes of your average scammer or spammer &#8212; someone who has to register dozens or even hundreds or thousands of domains a week to ply their trade. Are you going to create hundreds or thousands of email addresses and fabricate as many personal details to make your WHOIS listings that much harder for researchers to track? The answer is that those who take this extraordinary step are by far and away the exception rather than the rule. Most simply reuse the same email address and phony address/phone/contact information across many domains as long as it remains profitable for them to do so.</p>
<p>This pattern of WHOIS data reuse doesn&#8217;t just extend across a few weeks or months. Very often, if a spammer, phisher or scammer can get away with re-using the same WHOIS details over many years without any deleterious effects to their operations, they will happily do so. Why they may do this is their own business, but nevertheless it makes WHOIS an incredibly powerful tool for tracking threat actors across multiple networks, registrars and Internet epochs.</p>
<p><strong>All domain registrars offer free or a-la-carte privacy protection services that mask the personal information provided by the domain registrant. Most cybercriminals &#8212; unless they are dumb or lazy &#8212; are already taking advantage of these anyway, so it&#8217;s not clear why masking domain registration for everyone is going to change the status quo by much. </strong></p>
<p>It is true that some domain registrants do take advantage of WHOIS privacy services, but based on countless investigations I have conducted using WHOIS to uncover cybercrime businesses and operators, I&#8217;d wager that cybercrooks more often do <em>not</em> use these services. Not infrequently, when they <em>do</em> use WHOIS privacy options there are still gaps in coverage at some point in the domain&#8217;s history (such as when a registrant switches hosting providers) which are indexed by historic WHOIS records and that offer a brief window of visibility into the details behind the registration.</p>
<p>This is demonstrably true <a href="https://twitter.com/ClearskySec/status/984029180789698560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even for organized cybercrime groups and for nation state actors</a>, and these are arguably some of the most sophisticated and savvy cybercriminals out there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth adding that if so many cybercrooks seem nonchalant about adopting WHOIS privacy services it may well be because they reside in countries where the rule of law is not well-established, or their host country doesn&#8217;t particularly discourage their activities so long as they&#8217;re not violating the golden rule &#8212; namely, targeting people in their own backyard. And so they may not particularly care about covering their tracks. Or in other cases they do care, but nevertheless make mistakes or get sloppy at some point, as most cybercriminals do.</p>
<p><strong>The GDPR does not apply to businesses &#8212; only to individuals &#8212; so there is no reason researchers or anyone else should be unable to find domain registration details for organizations and companies in the WHOIS database after May 25, right?</strong></p>
<p>It is true that the European privacy regulations as they relate to WHOIS records do not apply to businesses registering domain names. However, the domain registrar industry &#8212; which operates on razor-thin profit margins and which has long sought to be free from any WHOIS requirements or accountability whatsoever &#8212; won&#8217;t exactly be tripping over themselves to add more complexity to their WHOIS efforts just to make a distinction between businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>As a result, registrars simply won&#8217;t make that distinction because there is no mandate that they must. They&#8217;ll just adopt the same WHOIS data collection and display polices across the board, regardless of whether the WHOIS details for a given domain suggest that the registrant is a business or an individual. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/04/security-trade-offs-in-the-new-eu-privacy-law/#more-43561" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
