												<p>The fraudsters behind the often laughable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nigerian prince email scams</a> have long since branched out into far more serious and lucrative forms of fraud, including account takeovers, phishing, dating scams, and malware deployment. Combating such a multifarious menace can seem daunting, and it calls for concerted efforts to tackle the problem from many different angles. This post examines the work of a large, private group of volunteers dedicated to doing just that.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-37128" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/athook.png" alt="" width="194" height="375" />According to the most recent statistics from the <strong>FBI</strong>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a>, the most costly form of cybercrime stems from a complex type of fraud known as the &#8220;<strong>B</strong>usiness <strong>E</strong>mail <strong>C</strong>ompromise&#8221; or BEC scam. A typical BEC scam involves phony e-mails in which the attacker <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/04/fbi-2-3-billion-lost-to-ceo-email-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoofs a message from an executive at a company</a> or a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/04/blind-trust-in-email-could-cost-you-your-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real estate escrow firm</a> and tricks someone into wiring funds to the fraudsters.</p>
<p>The FBI says BEC scams <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/media/2018/180712.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">netted thieves more than $12 billion between 2013 and 2018</a>. However, BEC scams succeed thanks to help from a variety of seemingly unrelated types of online fraud &#8212; most especially dating scams. I recently interviewed <strong>Ronnie Tokazowski</strong>, a reverse engineer at New York City-based security firm <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flashpoint</a> and something of an expert on BEC fraud.</p>
<p>Tokazowski is an expert on the subject thanks to his founding in 2015 of the <strong>BEC Mailing List</strong>, a private discussion group comprising more than 530 experts from a cross section of security firms, Internet and email providers and law enforcement agents that is dedicated to making life more difficult for scammers who perpetrate these schemes.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tokazowski <a href="https://www.m3aawg.org/Rel-FalkAward-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was given the JD Falk award</a> by the <strong>Messaging Malware Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group</strong> (M3AAWG) for his efforts in building and growing the BEC List (loyal readers here may recognize the M3AAWG name: KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://www.m3aawg.org/news/investigative-journalist-brian-krebs-receives-m3aawg-mary-litynski-award-for-protecting-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a different award from M3AAWG in 2014</a>). M3AAWG presents its JD Falk Award annually to recognize &#8220;a project that helps protect the internet and embodies a spirit of volunteerism and community building.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are some snippets from our conversation:</p>
<p><strong>Brian Krebs (BK)</strong>: You were given the award by M3AAWG in part for your role in starting the BEC mailing list, but more importantly for the list’s subsequent growth and impact on the BEC problem as a whole. Talk about why and how that got started and evolved.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Tokazowski (RT): </strong>The why is that there&#8217;s a lot of money being lost to this type of fraud. If you just look at the financial losses across cybercrime &#8212; including ransomware, banking trojans and everything else &#8212; BEC is number one. Something like 63 percent of fraud losses reported to the FBI are related to it.</p>
<p>When we started the list around Christmas of 2015, it was just myself and one FBI agent. When we had our first conference in May 2016, there were about 20 people attending to try to figure out how to tackle all of the individual pieces of this type of fraud.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the group now has about 530 people, we’ve now held three conferences, and collectively the group has directly or indirectly contributed to over 100 arrests for people involved in BEC scams.</p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> What did you discover as the group began to coalesce?</p>
<p><strong>RT:</strong> As we started getting more and more people involved, we realized BEC was much broader than just phishing emails. These guys actually maintain vast networks of money mules, technical and logistical infrastructure, as well as tons of romance scam accounts that they have to maintain over time.</p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> I want to ask you more about the romance scam aspect of BEC fraud in just a moment, because that’s one of the most fascinating cogs in this enormous crime machine. But I’m curious about what short-term goals the group set in identifying the individuals behind these extremely lucrative scams?</p>
<p><strong>RT:</strong> We wanted to start a collaboration group to fight BEC, and really a big part of that involved just trying to social engineer the actors and get them to click on links that we could use to find out more about them and where they’re coming from. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/how-do-you-fight-a-12b-fraud-problem-one-scammer-at-a-time/#more-45292" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A powerful, easy-to-use password stealing program known as <strong>Agent Tesla</strong> has been infecting computers since 2014, but recently this malware strain has seen a surge in popularity &#8212; attracting more than 6,300 customers who pay subscription fees to license the software. Although Agent Tesla includes a multitude of features designed to help it remain undetected on host computers, the malware&#8217;s apparent creator seems to have done little to hide his real-life identity.</p>
<p>The proprietors of Agent Tesla market their product at <strong>agenttesla-dot-com</strong>, selling access to the software in licenses paid for via bitcoin, for prices ranging from $15 to $69 depending on the desired features.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/agent-tesla-pricing.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45417" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/agent-tesla-pricing.png" alt="" width="588" height="336" /></a></p>
<p>The Agent Tesla Web site emphasizes that the software is strictly &#8220;for monitoring your personel [sic] computer.&#8221; The site&#8217;s &#8220;about&#8221; page states that Agent Tesla &#8220;is not a malware. Please, don&#8217;t use for computers which is not access permission.&#8221; To backstop this disclaimer, the site warns that any users caught doing otherwise will have their software licenses revoked and subscriptions canceled.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Agent Tesla Web site and its 24/7 technical support channel (offered via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a>) is replete with instances of support personnel instructing users on ways to evade antivirus software detection, use software vulnerabilities to deploy the product, and secretly bundle the program inside of other file types, such as images, text, audio and even <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> files.</p>
<div id="attachment_45418" style="width: 597px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/user-friendly.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45418" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-45418" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/user-friendly.png" alt="" width="587" height="397" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45418" class="wp-caption-text">A description of some of the options posted to the Agent Tesla sales Web site.</p></div>
<p>In August 2018, computer security firm LastLine <a href="https://www.lastline.com/labsblog/surge-of-agent-tesla-threat-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said it witnessed a 100 percent increase in Agent Tesla instances</a> detected in the wild over just a three month period.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acting as a fully-functional information stealer, it is capable of extracting credentials from different browsers, mail, and FTP clients,&#8221; LastLine wrote. &#8220;It logs keys and clipboards data, captures screen and video, and performs form-grabbing (Instagram, Twitter, Gmail, Facebook, etc.) attacks.&#8221;</p>

<h4>I CAN HAZ TESLA</h4>
<p>The earliest versions of Agent Tesla were made available for free via a Turkish-language <strong>WordPress</strong> site that oddly enough remains online (agenttesla.wordpress-dot-com), although its home page now instructs users to visit the current AgentTesla-dot-com domain. Not long after that WordPress site was erected, its author(s) began charging for the software, accepting payments via a variety of means, including <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=96EVAEPNZ6728" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a>, Bitcoin and even wire transfer to several bank accounts in Turkey.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/agenttestla-fb-red.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-45424" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/agenttestla-fb-red.png" alt="" width="254" height="264" /></a>Historic WHOIS Web site registration records maintained by <a href="https://www.domaintools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domaintools.com</a> show that the current domain for the software &#8212; agenttesla-dot-com &#8212; was registered in 2014 to a young man from Antalya, Turkey named <strong>Mustafa can Ozaydin</strong>, and to the email address <strong>mcanozaydin@gmail.com</strong>. Sometime in mid-2016 the site&#8217;s registration records were hidden behind WHOIS privacy services [full disclosure: Domaintools is a previous advertiser on KrebsOnSecurity].</p>
<p>That Gmail address is tied to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzER3hOQTA31t5blFfJ4xzQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Youtube.com account</a> for a Turkish individual by the same name who has uploaded exactly three videos over the past four years. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wjwj4S_2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of them</a>, uploaded in October 2017 and titled &#8220;web panel,&#8221; Mr. can Ozaydin demonstrates how to configure a Web site. At around 3:45 in the video, we can see the purpose of this demonstration is to show people one way to install an Agent Tesla control panel to keep track of systems infected with the malware.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the administrator of the 24/7 live support channel for Agent Tesla users at one point instructed customers to view this same video if they were having trouble figuring out how to deploy the control panel.</p>
<p>The profile picture shown in that Youtube account is remarkably similar to the one displayed on the <a href="https://twitter.com/MCanOZAYDIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account &#8220;MCanOZAYDIN</a>.&#8221; This Twitter profile makes no mention of Agent Tesla, but it does state that Mustafa can Ozaydin is an &#8220;information technology specialist&#8221; in Antalya, Turkey.</p>
<p>That Twitter profile also shows up on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mustafacanozaydin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Facebook account for a Mustafa can Ozaydin</a> from Turkey. A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mustafa-can-%C3%B6zaydin-b2365678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> for a person by the same name from Antalya, Turkey states that Mr. can Ozaydin is currently a &#8220;systems support expert&#8221; for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/memorial-health-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memorial Healthcare Group</a>, a hospital in Istanbul.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity first reached out for comment to all of these accounts back in August 2018, but received no reply. Repeated attempts to reach those accounts this past week also elicited no response. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/who-is-agent-tesla/#more-44783" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Earlier this month I spoke at a <a href="https://symposium.greycastlesecurity.com/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cybersecurity conference in Albany, N.Y.</a> alongside <strong>Tony Sager</strong>, senior vice president and chief evangelist at the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Internet Security</a> and a former bug hunter at the <strong>U.S. National Security Agency</strong>. We talked at length about many issues, including supply chain security, and I asked Sager whether he&#8217;d heard anything about rumors that <strong>Supermicro</strong> &#8212; a high tech firm in San Jose, Calif. &#8212; had allegedly inserted hardware backdoors in technology sold to a number of American companies.</p>
<div id="attachment_45392" style="width: 271px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45392" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45392" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tonysager.png" alt="" width="261" height="281" /><p id="caption-attachment-45392" class="wp-caption-text">Tony Sager, senior vice president and chief evangelist at the <strong>Center for Internet Security.</strong></p></div>
<p>The event Sager and I spoke at was prior to the publication of <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies?srnd=businessweek-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial story</a> alleging that Supermicro had duped almost 30 companies into buying backdoored hardware. Sager said he hadn&#8217;t heard anything about Supermicro specifically, but we chatted at length about the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/supply-chain-security-is-the-whole-enchilada-but-whos-willing-to-pay-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenges of policing the technology supply chain</a>.</p>
<p>Below are some excerpts from our conversation. I learned quite bit, and I hope you will, too.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Krebs (BK):</strong> Do you think Uncle Sam spends enough time focusing on the supply chain security problem? It seems like a pretty big threat, but also one that is really hard to counter.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Tony Sager (TS):</b> The federal government has been worrying about this kind of problem for decades. In the 70s and 80s, the government was more dominant in the technology industry and didn&#8217;t have this massive internationalization of the technology supply chain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But even then there were people who saw where this was all going, and there were some pretty big government programs to look into it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>BK:</b> Right, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Foundry_Program"><span class="s2">Trusted Foundry</span></a> program I guess is a good example.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>TS:</b> Exactly. That was an attempt to help support a U.S.-based technology industry so that we had an indigenous place to work with, and where we have only cleared people and total control over the processes and parts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>BK:</b> Why do you think more companies aren&#8217;t insisting on producing stuff through code and hardware foundries here in the U.S.?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>TS:</b> Like a lot of things in security, the economics always win. And eventually the cost differential for offshoring parts and labor overwhelmed attempts at managing that challenge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>BK:</b> But certainly there are some areas of computer hardware and network design where you absolutely must have far greater integrity assurance?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>TS:</b> Right, and this is how they approach things at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories"><span class="s2">Sandia National Laboratories</span></a> [one of three national nuclear security research and development laboratories]. One of the things they&#8217;ve looked at is this whole business of whether someone might sneak something into the design of a nuclear weapon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The basic design principle has been to assume that one person in the process may have been subverted somehow, and the whole design philosophy is built around making sure that no one person gets to sign off on what goes into a particular process, and that there is never unobserved control over any one aspect of the system. So, there are a lot of technical and procedural controls there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the bottom line is that doing this is really much harder [for non-nuclear electronic components] because of all the offshoring now of electronic parts, as well as the software that runs on top of that hardware.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>BK:</b> So is the government basically only interested in supply chain security so long as it affects stuff they want to buy and use?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>TS:</b> The government still has regular meetings on supply chain risk management, but there are no easy answers to this problem. The technical ability to detect something wrong has been outpaced by the ability to do something about it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>BK:</b> Wait&#8230;what?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>TS:</b> Suppose a nation state dominates a piece of technology and in theory could plant something inside of it. The attacker in this case has a risk model, too. Yes, he could put something in the circuitry or design, but his risk of exposure also goes up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Could I as an attacker control components that go into certain designs or products? Sure, but it&#8217;s often not very clear what the target is for that product, or how you will guarantee it gets used by your target. And there are still a limited set of bad guys who can pull that stuff off. In the past, it&#8217;s been much more lucrative for the attacker to attack the supply chain on the distribution side, to go after targeted machines in targeted markets to lessen the exposure of this activity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>BK:</b> So targeting your attack becomes problematic if you&#8217;re not really limiting the scope of targets that get hit with compromised hardware.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>TS:</b> Yes, you can put something into everything, but all of a sudden you have this massive big data collection problem on the back end where you as the attacker have created a different kind of analysis problem. Of course, some nations have more capability than others to sift through huge amounts of data they&#8217;re collecting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>BK:</b> Can you talk about some of the things the government has typically done to figure out whether a given technology supplier might be trying to slip in a few compromised devices among an order of many?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>TS:</b> There&#8217;s this concept of the &#8220;blind buy,&#8221; where if you think the threat vector is someone gets into my supply chain and subverts the security of individual machines or groups of machines, the government figures out a way to purchase specific systems so that no one can target them. In other words, the seller doesn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s the government who&#8217;s buying it. This is a pretty standard technique to get past this, but it&#8217;s an ongoing cat and mouse game to be sure.</span> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/supply-chain-security-101-an-experts-view/#more-45356" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> this week released software updates to fix roughly 50 security problems with various versions of its <strong>Windows</strong> operating system and related software, including one flaw that is already being exploited and another for which exploit code is publicly available.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-26837" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brokenwindows.png" alt="" width="229" height="240" />The zero-day bug &#8212; <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8453</a> &#8212; affects Windows versions 7, 8.1, 10 and Server 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019. According to security firm <strong>Ivanti</strong>, an attacker first needs to log into the operating system, but then can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrator privileges.</p>
<p>Another vulnerability patched on Tuesday &#8212; <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8423</a> &#8212; was publicly disclosed last month along with sample exploit code. This flaw involves a component shipped on all Windows machines and used by a number of programs, and could be exploited by getting a user to open a specially-crafted file &#8212; such as a booby-trapped <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> document.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has frequently suggested that Windows users wait a day or two after Microsoft releases monthly security updates before installing the fixes, with the rationale that occasionally buggy patches can cause serious headaches for users who install them before all the kinks are worked out.</p>
<p>This month, Microsoft briefly paused updates for Windows 10 users after many users reported losing all of the files in their &#8220;My Documents&#8221; folder. The worst part? Rolling back to previous saved versions of Windows prior to the update did not restore the files. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/patch-tuesday-october-2018-edition/#more-45380" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>What do we do with a company that regularly pumps metric tons of virtual toxic sludge onto the Internet and yet refuses to clean up their act? If ever there were a technology giant that deserved to be named and shamed for polluting the Web, it is <strong>Xiongmai</strong> &#8212; a Chinese maker of electronic parts that power a huge percentage of cheap digital video recorders (DVRs) and Internet-connected security cameras.</p>
<div id="attachment_45349" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45349" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45349" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/xmbldg.png" alt="" width="588" height="358" /><p id="caption-attachment-45349" class="wp-caption-text">A rendering of Xiongmai&#8217;s center in Hangzhou, China. Source: xiongmaitech.com</p></div>
<p>In late 2016, the world witnessed the sheer disruptive power of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=mirai&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirai</a>, a powerful botnet strain fueled by Internet of Things (IoT) devices like DVRs and IP cameras that were <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/who-makes-the-iot-things-under-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put online with factory-default passwords and other poor security settings</a>.</p>
<p>Security experts <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soon discovered</a> that a majority of Mirai-infected devices were chiefly composed of components made by Xiongmai (a.k.a. <strong>Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology Co., Ltd.</strong>) and a handful of other Chinese tech firms that seemed to have a history of placing product market share and price above security.</p>
<p>Since then, two of those firms &#8212; <strong>Huawei</strong> and <strong>Dahua</strong> &#8212; have taken steps to increase the security of their IoT products out-of-the-box. But Xiongmai &#8212; despite repeated warnings from researchers about deep-seated vulnerabilities in its hardware &#8212; has continued to ignore such warnings and to ship massively insecure hardware and software for use in products that are white-labeled and sold by more than 100 third-party vendors.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Austrian security firm <a href="https://www.sec-consult.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC Consult</a> released the results of extensive research into multiple, lingering and serious security holes in Xiongmai&#8217;s hardware.</p>
<p>SEC Consult said it began the process of working with Xiongmai on these problems back in March 2018, but that it finally published its research after it became clear that Xiongmai wasn&#8217;t going to address any of the problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although Xiongmai had seven months notice, they have not fixed any of the issues,&#8221; the researchers wrote in a blog post published today. &#8220;The conversation with them over the past months has shown that security is just not a priority to them at all.&#8221;</p>
<h4>PROBLEM TO PROBLEM</h4>
<p>A core part of the problem is the peer-to-peer (P2P) communications component called &#8220;<strong>XMEye</strong>&#8221; that ships with all Xiongmai devices and automatically connects them to a cloud network run by Xiongmai. The P2P feature is designed so that consumers can access their DVRs or security cameras remotely anywhere in the world and without having to configure anything.</p>
<div id="attachment_45350" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45350" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-45350" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/xmeyesolutions.png" alt="" width="595" height="262" /><p id="caption-attachment-45350" class="wp-caption-text">The various business lines of Xiongmai. Source: xiongmaitech.com</p></div>
<p>To access a Xiongmai device via the P2P network, one must know the Unique ID (UID) assigned to each device. The UID is essentially derived in an easily reproducible way using the device&#8217;s built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAC address</a> (a string of numbers and letters, such as 68ab8124db83c8db).</p>
<p>Electronics firms are <a href="http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assigned</a> ranges of MAC address that they may use, but SEC Consult discovered that Xiongmai for some reason actually uses MAC address ranges assigned to a number of other companies, including tech giant <a href="https://www.cisco.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco Systems</a>, German printing press maker <a href="https://www.koenig-bauer.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koenig &amp; Bauer AG</a>, and Swiss chemical analysis firm <a href="https://www.metrohm.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metrohm AG</a>.</p>
<p>SEC Consult learned that it was trivial to find Xiongmai devices simply by computing all possible ranges of UIDs for each range of MAC addresses, and then scanning Xiongmai&#8217;s public cloud for XMEye-enabled devices. Based on scanning just two percent of the available ranges, SEC Consult conservatively estimates there are around 9 million Xiongmai P2P devices online.</p>
<p>[For the record, KrebsOnSecurity has <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/02/this-is-why-people-fear-the-internet-of-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long</a> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/12/researchers-find-fresh-fodder-for-iot-attack-cannons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advised</a> buyers of IoT devices to avoid those advertise P2P capabilities for just this reason. The Xiongmai debacle is yet another example of why this remains solid advice].</p>
<h4>BLANK TO BANK</h4>
<p>While one still needs to provide a username and password to remotely access XMEye devices via this method, SEC Consult notes that the default password of the all-powerful administrative user (username &#8220;admin&#8221;) is blank (i.e, no password).</p>
<p>The admin account can be used to do anything to the device, such as changing its settings or uploading software &#8212; including malware like Mirai. And because users are not required to set a secure password in the initial setup phase, it is likely that a large number of devices are accessible via these default credentials.</p>

<p>Even if a customer has changed the default admin password, SEC Consult discovered there is an undocumented user with the name &#8220;default,&#8221; whose password is &#8220;tluafed&#8221; (default in reverse). While this user account can&#8217;t change system settings, it is still able to view any video streams.</p>
<p>Normally, hardware devices are secured against unauthorized software updates by requiring that any new software pushed to the devices be digitally signed with a secret cryptographic key that is held only by the hardware or software maker. However, XMEye-enabled devices have no such protections.</p>
<p>In fact, the researchers found it was trivial to set up a system that mimics the XMEye cloud and push malicious firmware updates to any device. Worse still, unlike with the Mirai malware &#8212; which gets permanently wiped from memory when an infected device powers off or is rebooted &#8212; the update method devised by SEC Consult makes it so that any software uploaded survives a reboot. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/naming-shaming-web-polluters-xiongmai/#more-45290" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>From time to time, there emerge cybersecurity stories of such potential impact that they have the effect of making all other security concerns seem minuscule and trifling by comparison. Yesterday was one of those times. <em>Bloomberg</em> <em>Businessweek</em> on Thursday <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies?srnd=businessweek-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a bombshell</a> investigation alleging that Chinese cyber spies had used a U.S.-based tech firm to secretly embed tiny computer chips into electronic devices purchased and used by almost 30 different companies. There aren&#8217;t any corroborating accounts of this scoop so far, but it is both fascinating and terrifying to look at why threats to the global technology supply chain can be so difficult to detect, verify and counter.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-45324" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bbb-chip.png" alt="" width="288" height="395" />In the context of computer and Internet security, supply chain security refers to the challenge of validating that a given piece of electronics &#8212; and by extension the software that powers those computing parts &#8212; does not include any extraneous or fraudulent components beyond what was specified by the company that paid for the production of said item.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the Bloomberg story claims that San Jose, Calif. based tech giant <strong>Supermicro</strong> was somehow caught up in a plan to quietly insert a rice-sized computer chip on the circuit boards that get put into a variety of servers and electronic components purchased by major vendors, allegedly including <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong>. The chips were alleged to have spied on users of the devices and sent unspecified data back to the Chinese military.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s critical to note up top that Amazon, Apple and Supermicro <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-amazon-apple-supermicro-and-beijing-respond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have categorically denied most of the claims in the Bloomberg piece</a>. That is, their positions refuting core components of the story would appear to leave little wiggle room for future backtracking on those statements. Amazon also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penned a blog post</a> that more emphatically stated their objections to the Bloomberg piece.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bloomberg reporters write that &#8220;the companies’ denials are countered by six current and former senior national security officials, who—in conversations that began during the Obama administration and continued under the Trump administration—detailed the discovery of the chips and the government’s investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, Supermicro sells more server motherboards than almost anyone else. It also dominates the $1 billion market for boards used in special-purpose computers, from MRI machines to weapons systems. Its motherboards can be found in made-to-order server setups at banks, hedge funds, cloud computing providers, and web-hosting services, among other places. Supermicro has assembly facilities in California, the Netherlands, and Taiwan, but its motherboards—its core product—are nearly all manufactured by contractors in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many readers have asked for my take on this piece. I heard similar allegations earlier this year about Supermicro and tried mightily to verify them but could not. That in itself should be zero gauge of the story&#8217;s potential merit. After all, I am just one guy, whereas this is the type of scoop that usually takes entire portions of a newsroom to research, report and vet. By Bloomberg&#8217;s own account, the story took more than a year to report and write, and cites 17 anonymous sources as confirming the activity.</p>
<p>Most of what I have to share here is based on conversations with some clueful people over the years who would probably find themselves confined to a tiny, windowless room for an extended period if their names or quotes ever showed up in a story like this, so I will tread carefully around this subject.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government isn&#8217;t eager to admit it, but there has long been an unofficial inventory of tech components and vendors that are forbidden to buy from if you&#8217;re in charge of procuring products or services on behalf of the U.S. Government. Call it the &#8220;brown list, &#8220;black list,&#8221; &#8220;entity list&#8221; or what have you, but it&#8217;s basically an indelible index of companies that are on the permanent Shit List of Uncle Sam for having been caught pulling some kind of supply chain shenanigans.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago when I was a reporter with <em>The Washington Post</em>, I heard from an extremely well-placed source that one Chinese tech company had made it onto Uncle Sam&#8217;s entity list because they sold a custom hardware component for many Internet-enabled printers that secretly made a copy of every document or image sent to the printer and forwarded that to a server allegedly controlled by hackers aligned with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>That example gives a whole new meaning to the term &#8220;supply chain,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t it? If Bloomberg&#8217;s reporting is accurate, that&#8217;s more or less what we&#8217;re dealing with here in Supermicro as well.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: Even if you identify which technology vendors are guilty of supply-chain hacks, it can be difficult to enforce their banishment from the procurement chain. One reason is that it is often tough to tell from the brand name of a given gizmo who actually makes all the multifarious components that go into any one electronic device sold today.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the problem right now with insecure <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (IoT) devices &#8212; cheapo security cameras, Internet routers and digital video recorders &#8212; sold at places like Amazon and Walmart. Many of these IoT devices have become a major security problem because they are massively insecure by default and difficult if not also impractical to secure after they are sold and put into use.</p>
<p>For every company in China that produces these IoT devices, there are dozens of &#8220;white label&#8221; firms that market and/or sell the core electronic components as their own. So while security researchers might identify a set of security holes in IoT products made by one company whose products are white labeled by others, actually informing consumers about which third-party products include those vulnerabilities can be extremely challenging. In some cases, a technology vendor responsible for some part of this mess may simply go out of business or close its doors and re-emerge under different names and managers.</p>
<p>Mind you, there is no indication anyone is purposefully engineering so many of these IoT products to be insecure; a more likely explanation is that building in more security tends to make devices considerably more expensive and slower to market. In many cases, their insecurity stems from a combination of factors: They ship with every imaginable feature turned on by default; they bundle outdated software and firmware components; and their default settings are difficult or impossible for users to change.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t often hear about <em>intentional</em> efforts to subvert the security of the technology supply chain simply because these incidents tend to get quickly classified by the military when they are discovered. But the U.S. Congress has held multiple hearings about supply chain security challenges, and the U.S. government has taken steps on several occasions to block Chinese tech companies from doing business with the federal government and/or U.S.-based firms.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Pentagon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/02/pentagon-tells-u-s-military-bases-to-stop-selling-zte-huawei-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned the sale of Chinese-made ZTE and Huawei phones on military bases</a>, according to a Defense Department directive that cites security risks posed by the devices. The <strong>U.S. Department of Commerce</strong> also has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/u-s-companies-banned-from-selling-components-to-zte/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instituted a seven-year export restriction for ZTE</a>, resulting in a ban on U.S. component makers selling to ZTE.</p>
<p>Still, the issue here isn&#8217;t that we can&#8217;t trust technology products made in China. Indeed there are numerous examples of other countries &#8212; including the United States and its allies &#8212; slipping their own &#8220;backdoors&#8221; into hardware and software products.</p>
<p><em>Like it or not, the vast majority of electronics are made in China, and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. The central issue is that we don&#8217;t have any other choice right now</em>. <em>The reason is that by nearly all accounts it would be punishingly expensive to replicate that manufacturing process here in the United States.</em></p>
<p>Even if the U.S. government and Silicon Valley somehow mustered the funding and political will to do that, insisting that products sold to U.S. consumers or the U.S. government be made only with components made here in the U.S.A. would massively drive up the cost of all forms of technology. Consumers would almost certainly balk at buying these way more expensive devices. Years of experience has shown that consumers aren&#8217;t interested in paying a huge premium for security when a comparable product with the features they want is available much more cheaply. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/supply-chain-security-is-the-whole-enchilada-but-whos-willing-to-pay-for-it/#more-45297" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A ridiculous number of companies are exposing some or all of their proprietary and customer data by putting it in the cloud without any kind of authentication needed to read, alter or destroy it. When cybercriminals are the first to discover these missteps, usually the outcome is a demand for money in return for the stolen data. But when these screw-ups are unearthed by security professionals seeking to make a name for themselves, the resulting publicity often can leave the breached organization wishing they&#8217;d instead been quietly extorted by anonymous crooks.</p>
<p>Last week, I was on a train from New York to Washington, D.C. when I received a phone call from <strong>Vinny Troia</strong>, a security researcher who runs a startup in Missouri called <strong>NightLion Security</strong>. Troia had discovered that <strong>All American Entertainment</strong>, a speaker bureau which represents a number of celebrities who also can be hired to do public speaking, had exposed thousands of speaking contracts via an unsecured <strong>Amazon</strong> cloud instance.</p>
<p>The contracts laid out how much each speaker makes per event, details about their travel arrangements, and any requirements or obligations stated in advance by both parties to the contract. No secret access or password was needed to view the documents.</p>
<p>It was a juicy find to be sure: I can now tell you how much <strong>Oprah</strong> makes per event (it&#8217;s <em>a</em> <em>lot</em>). Ditto for <strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong>, <strong>Olivia Newton John</strong>, <strong>Michael J. Fox </strong>and a host of others. But I&#8217;m not going to do that.</p>
<p>Firstly, it&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business what they make. More to the point, All American also is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/cpm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>my</em> speaker bureau</a>, and included in the cache of documents the company exposed in the cloud were some of my speaking contracts. In fact, when Troia called about his find, I was on my way home from <a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1045097555112136704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one such engagement</a>.</p>
<p>I quickly informed my contact at All American and asked them to let me know the moment they confirmed the data was removed from the Internet. While awaiting that confirmation, my pent-up frustration <a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1045091640480804864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeped into a tweet</a> that seemed to touch a raw nerve among others in the security industry.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45250" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/leakhackloselift.png" alt="" width="597" height="370" /></p>
<p>The same day I alerted them, All American took down its bucket of unsecured speaker contract data, and apologized profusely for the oversight (although I have yet to hear a good explanation as to why this data needed to be stored in the cloud to begin with).</p>
<p>This was hardly the first time Troia had alerted me about a huge cache of important or sensitive data that companies have left exposed online. On Monday, <em>TechCrunch</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/01/apollo-contacts-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the story</a> about a &#8220;breach&#8221; at <strong>Apollo</strong>, a sales engagement startup boasting a database of more than 200 million contact records. Calling it a breach seems a bit of a stretch; it probably would be more accurate to describe the incident as a data leak.</p>
<p>Just like my speaker bureau, Apollo had simply put all this data up on an Amazon server that anyone on the Internet could access without providing a password. And Troia was again the one who figured out that the data had been leaked by Apollo &#8212; the result of an intensive, months-long process that took some extremely interesting twists and turns.</p>
<p>That journey &#8212; which I will endeavor to describe here &#8212; offered some uncomfortable insights into how organizations frequently learn about data leaks these days, and indeed whether they derive any lasting security lessons from the experience at all. It also gave me a new appreciation for how difficult it can be for organizations that screw up this way to tell the difference between a security researcher and a bad guy.</p>
<h4>THE DARK OVERLORD</h4>
<p>I began hearing from Troia almost daily beginning in mid-2017. At the time, he was on something of a personal mission to discover the real-life identity behind <strong>The Dark Overlord</strong> (TDO), the pseudonym used by an individual or group of criminals who have been extorting dozens of companies &#8212; particularly healthcare providers &#8212; after hacking into their systems and stealing sensitive data.</p>
<p>The Dark Overlord&#8217;s method was roughly the same in each attack. Gain access to sensitive data (often <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/hacked-via-rdp-really-dumb-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by purchasing access through crimeware-as-a-service offerings</a>), and send a long, rambling ransom note to the victim organization demanding tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin for the safe return of said data.</p>
<p>Victims were typically told that if they refused to pay, the stolen data would be sold to cybercriminals lurking on Dark Web forums. Worse yet, TDO also promised to make sure the news media knew that victim organizations were more interested in keeping the breach private than in securing the privacy of their customers or patients.</p>
<p>In fact, the apparent ringleader of TDO reached out to KrebsOnSecurity in May 2016 with a remarkable offer. Using the nickname &#8220;<strong>Arnie</strong>,&#8221; the public voice of TDO said he was offering exclusive access to news about their latest extortion targets.</p>
<div id="attachment_45265" style="width: 588px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tdoconvo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45265" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-45265 size-full" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tdoconvo.png" alt="" width="578" height="758" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45265" class="wp-caption-text">Snippets from a long email conversation in May 2016 with a hacker who introduced himself as Adam but would later share his nickname as &#8220;Arnie&#8221; and disclose that he was a member of The Dark Overlord. In this conversation, he is offering to sell access to scoops about data breaches that he caused.</p></div>
<p>Arnie claimed he was an administrator or key member on several top Dark Web forums, and provided a handful of convincing clues to back up his claim. He told me he had real-time access to dozens of healthcare organizations they&#8217;d hacked into, and that each one which refused to give in to TDO&#8217;s extortion demands could turn into a juicy scoop for KrebsOnSecurity.</p>
<p>Arnie said he was coming to me first with the offer, but that he was planning to approach other journalists and news outlets if I declined. I balked after discovering that Arnie wasn&#8217;t offering this access for free: He wanted 10 bitcoin in exchange for exclusivity (at the time, his asking price was roughly equivalent to USD $5,000).</p>
<p>Perhaps other news outlets are accustomed to paying for scoops, but that is not something I would ever consider. And in any case the whole thing was starting to smell like a shakedown or scam. I declined the offer. It&#8217;s possible other news outlets or journalists did not; I will not speculate on this matter further, other than to say readers can draw their own conclusions based on the timeline and the public record. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/when-security-researchers-pose-as-cybercrooks-who-can-tell-the-difference/#more-45246" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Most of us have been trained to be wary of clicking on links and attachments that arrive in emails unexpected, but it&#8217;s easy to forget scam artists are constantly dreaming up innovations that put a new shine on old-fashioned telephone-based phishing scams. Think you&#8217;re too smart to fall for one? Think again: Even technology experts are getting taken in by some of the more recent schemes (or very nearly).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45224" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/phonescam.png" alt="" width="590" height="372" /></p>
<p><strong>Matt Haughey</strong> is the creator of the community Weblog <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaFilter</a> and a writer at <a href="https://www.slack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack</a>. Haughey banks at a small Portland credit union, and last week he got a call on his mobile phone from an 800-number that matched the number his credit union uses.</p>
<p>Actually, he got three calls from the same number in rapid succession. He ignored the first two, letting them both go to voicemail. But he picked up on the third call, thinking it must be something urgent and important. After all, his credit union had rarely ever called him.</p>
<p>Haughey said he was greeted by a female voice who explained that the credit union had blocked two phony-looking charges in Ohio made to his debit/ATM card. She proceeded to then read him the last four digits of the card that was currently in his wallet. It checked out.</p>
<p>Haughey told the lady that he would need a replacement card immediately because he was about to travel out of state to California. Without missing a beat, the caller said he could keep his card and that the credit union would simply block any future charges that weren&#8217;t made in either Oregon or California.</p>
<p>This struck Haughey as a bit off. Why would the bank say they were freezing his card but then say they could keep it open for his upcoming trip? It was the first time the voice inside his head spoke up and said, &#8220;Something isn&#8217;t right, Matt.&#8221; But, he figured, the customer service person at the credit union was trying to be helpful: She was doing him a favor, he reasoned.</p>
<p>The caller then read his entire home address to double check it was the correct destination to send a new card at the conclusion of his trip. Then the caller said she needed to verify his mother&#8217;s maiden name. The voice in his head spoke out in protest again, but then banks had asked for this in the past. He provided it.</p>
<p>Next she asked him to verify the three digit security code printed on the back of his card. Once more, the voice of caution in his brain was silenced: He&#8217;d given this code out previously in the few times he&#8217;d used his card to pay for something over the phone.</p>
<p>Then she asked him for his current card PIN, just so she could apply that same PIN to the new card being mailed out, she assured him. Ding, ding, ding went the alarm bells in his head. Haughey hesitated, then asked the lady to repeat the question. When she did, he gave her the PIN, and she assured him she&#8217;d make sure his existing PIN also served as the PIN for his new card.</p>
<p>Haughey said after hanging up he felt fairly certain the entire transaction was legitimate, although the part about her requesting the PIN kept nagging at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I balked at challenging her because everything lined up,&#8221; he said in an interview with KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;But when I hung up the phone and told a friend about it, he was like, &#8216;Oh man, you just got scammed, there&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s real.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Now more concerned, Haughey visited his credit union to make sure his travel arrangements were set. When he began telling the bank employee what had transpired, he could tell by the look on her face that his friend was right.</p>
<p>A review of his account showed that there were indeed two fraudulent charges on his account from earlier that day totaling $3,400, but neither charge was from Ohio. Rather, someone used a counterfeit copy of his debit card to spend more than $2,900 at a Kroger near Atlanta, and to withdraw almost $500 from an ATM in the same area. After the unauthorized charges, he had just $300 remaining in his account.</p>
<p>&#8220;People I&#8217;ve talked to about this say there’s no way they&#8217;d fall for that, but when someone from a trustworthy number calls, says they&#8217;re from your small town bank, and sounds incredibly professional, you’d fall for it, too,&#8221; Haughey said.</p>
<p>Fraudsters can use a variety of open-source and free tools to fake or &#8220;spoof&#8221; the number displayed as the caller ID, lending legitimacy to phone phishing schemes. Often, just sprinkling in a little foreknowledge of the target&#8217;s personal details &#8212; SSNs, dates of birth, addresses and other information that can be purchased for a nominal fee from any one of several underground sites that sell such data &#8212; adds enough detail to the call to make it seem legitimate. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/voice-phishing-scams-are-getting-more-clever/#more-45154" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Facebook</strong> said today some 90 million of its users may get forcibly logged out of their accounts after the company fixed a rather glaring security vulnerability in its Web site that may have let attackers hijack user profiles. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/security-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a short blog post</a> published this afternoon, Facebook said hackers have been exploiting a vulnerability in Facebook&#8217;s site code that impacted a feature called &#8220;View As,&#8221; which lets users see how their profile appears to other people. </p>
<p>&#8220;This allowed them to steal Facebook access tokens which they could then use to take over people’s accounts,&#8221; Facebook wrote. &#8220;Access tokens are the equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to Facebook so they don’t need to re-enter their password every time they use the app.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook said it was removing the insecure &#8220;View As&#8221; feature, and resetting the access tokens of 50 million accounts that the company said it knows were affected, as well as the tokens for another 40 million users that may have been impacted over the past year. </p>
<p>The company said it was just beginning its investigation, and that it doesn&#8217;t yet know some basic facts about the incident, such as whether these accounts were misused, if any private information was accessed, or who might be responsible for these attacks. </p>
<p>Although Facebook didn&#8217;t mention this in their post, <em>one other major unanswered question about this incident is whether the access tokens could have let attackers interactively log in to third-party sites as the user</em>. Tens of thousands of Web sites let users log in using nothing more than their Facebook profile credentials. If users have previously logged in at third-party sites using their Facebook profile, there&#8217;s a good chance the attackers could have had access to those third-party sites as well. </p>
<p>I have asked for clarification from Facebook on this point and will update this post when and if I receive a response. However, I would have expected Facebook to mention this as a mitigating factor if authorized logins at third-party sites were <em>not</em> impacted. </p>
<p><strong>Update: 4:46 p.m. ET:</strong> A Facebook spokesperson confirmed that while it was technically possible that an attacker could have abused this bug to target third-party apps and sites that use Facebook logins, the company doesn&#8217;t have any evidence so far that this has happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have invalidated data access for third-party apps for the affected individuals,&#8221; the spokesperson said, referring to the 90 million accounts that were forcibly logged out today and presented with a notification about the incident at the top of their feed. </p>
<p><em>Original story:</em><br />
Facebook says there is no need for users to reset their passwords as a result of this breach, although that is certainly an option. </p>
<p>More importantly, it&#8217;s a good idea for all Facebook users to review their login activity. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security&#038;section=sessions&#038;view" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This page</a> should let you view which devices are logged in to your account and approximately where in the world those devices are at the moment. That page also has an option to force a simultaneous logout of all devices connected to your account.</p>

												<p>The <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> is warning financial institutions about a recent uptick in a form of ATM skimming that involves cutting cupcake-sized holes in a cash machine and then using a combination of magnets and medical devices to siphon customer account data directly from the card reader inside the ATM.</p>
<p>According to a non-public alert distributed to banks this week and shared with KrebsOnSecurity by a financial industry source, the Secret Service has received multiple reports about a complex form of skimming that often takes thieves days to implement.</p>
<p>This type of attack, sometimes called <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/11/skimmer-innovation-wiretapping-atms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATM &#8220;wiretapping&#8221;</a> or &#8220;eavesdropping,&#8221; starts when thieves use a drill to make a relatively large hole in the front of a cash machine. The hole is then concealed by a metal faceplate, or perhaps a decal featuring the bank&#8217;s logo or boilerplate instructions on how to use the ATM.</p>
<div id="attachment_45173" style="width: 597px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/skimhole.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45173" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-45173" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/skimhole.png" alt="" width="587" height="311" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45173" class="wp-caption-text">A thin metal faceplate is often used to conceal the hole drilled into the front of the ATM. The PIN pad shield pictured here is equipped with a hidden spy camera.</p></div>
<p>Skimmer thieves will fish the card skimming device through the hole and attach it to the internal card reader via a magnet.</p>
<div id="attachment_45175" style="width: 595px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/skimmag.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45175" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-45175" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/skimmag.png" alt="" width="585" height="765" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45175" class="wp-caption-text">Thieves often use a magnet to secure their card skimmer in place above the ATM&#8217;s internal card reader. Image: U.S. Secret Service.</p></div>
<p>Very often the fraudsters will be assisted in the skimmer installation by an endoscope, a slender, flexible instrument traditionally used in medicine to give physicians a look inside the human body. By connecting a USB-based endoscope to his smart phone, the intruder can then peek inside the ATM and ensure that his skimmer is correctly attached to the card reader. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/secret-service-warns-of-surge-in-atm-wiretapping-attacks/#more-45166" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
