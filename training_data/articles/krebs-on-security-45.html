												<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of donating money to help victims of <strong>Hurricane Florence</strong>, please do your research on the charitable entity before giving: A slew of new domains apparently related to Hurricane Florence relief efforts are now accepting donations on behalf of victims without much accountability for how the money will be spent.</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, KrebsOnSecurity has been monitoring dozens of new domain name registrations that include the terms &#8220;hurricane&#8221; and/or &#8220;florence&#8221; and some word related to support (e.g., &#8220;relief,&#8221; &#8220;assistance,&#8221; etc.). Most of these domains have remained parked or dormant since their creation earlier this month; however, several of them became active only in the past few days, directing visitors to donate money through private <strong>PayPal</strong> accounts without providing any information about who is running the site or what will be done with donated funds.</p>
<div id="attachment_45143" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/flofund.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45143" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-45143" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/flofund.png" alt="" width="593" height="324" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45143" class="wp-caption-text">The landing page for hurricaneflorencerelieffund-dot-com also is the landing page for at least 4 other Hurricane Florence donation sites that use the same anonymous PayPal address.</p></div>
<p>Among the earliest of these is <strong>hurricaneflorencerelieffund-dot-com</strong>, registered anonymously via <strong>GoDaddy</strong> on Sept. 13, 2018. Donations sent through the site&#8217;s <strong>PayPal</strong> page go to an email address tied to the PayPal account on the site (<strong>info@hurricaneflorencerelieffund-dot-com</strong>); emails to that address did not elicit a response.</p>
<p>Sometime in the past few days, several other Florence-related domains that were previous parked at GoDaddy now redirect to this domain, including <strong>hurricanflorence-dot-org</strong> (note the missing &#8220;e&#8221;); <strong>florencedisaster-dot-org</strong>; <strong>florencefunds-dot-com</strong>; and <strong>hurricaneflorencedonation-dot-com</strong>. All of these domains include the phone number <strong>833-FLO-FUND</strong>, which rings to an automated system that ultimately asks the caller to leave a message. There is no information provided about the organization or individual running the sites.</p>
<p>The domain <strong>hurricaneflorencedisasterfund-dot-com</strong> has a slightly different look and feel, invokes the name of the <strong>Red Cross</strong> and also includes the 833-FLO-FUND number. Likewise, it accepts PayPal donations tied to the same email address mentioned above. It claims &#8220;80% of all donations go directly to FIRST RESPONDERS in North &amp; South Carolina!&#8221; although it provides no clear way to verify that claim.</p>
<div id="attachment_45145" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/flofund2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45145" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-45145" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/flofund2.png" alt="" width="590" height="316" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45145" class="wp-caption-text">Hurricaneflorencedisasterfund-dot-com is one of several domains anonymously accepting PayPal donations, purportedly on behalf of Hurricane Florence victims.</p></div>
<p>The domain <strong>hurricaneflorencerelief-dot-fund</strong>, registered on Sept. 11, also accepts PayPal donations with minimal information about who might benefit from monies given. The site links to Facebook, Twitter and other social network accounts set up with the same name, although none of them appear to have any meaningful content. The email address tied to that PayPal account &#8212; <strong>hurricaneflorencerelief@gmail.com</strong> &#8212; did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hfrf.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45146" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hfrf.png" alt="" width="590" height="423" /></a></p>
<p>The domain <strong>theflorencefund-dot-com</strong> until recently also accepted PayPal donations and had <a href="https://twitter.com/florencefund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an associated Twitter account</a> (now deleted), but that domain recently changed its homepage to include the message, &#8220;Due to the change in Florence&#8217;s path, we&#8217;re suspending our efforts.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/beware-of-hurricane-florence-relief-scams/#more-45138" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>It is now free in every U.S. state to freeze and unfreeze your credit file and that of your dependents, a process that blocks identity thieves and others from looking at private details in your consumer credit history. If you&#8217;ve been holding out because you&#8217;re not particularly worried about ID theft, here&#8217;s another reason to reconsider: The credit bureaus profit from selling copies of your file to others, so freezing your file also lets you deny these dinosaurs a valuable revenue stream.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45129" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/freezeme-ed.png" alt="" width="591" height="121" /></p>
<p>Enacted in May 2018, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act</a> rolls back some of the restrictions placed on banks in the wake of the Great Recession of the last decade. But it also includes a silver lining. Previously, states allowed the bureaus to charge a confusing range of fees for placing, temporarily thawing or lifting a credit freeze. Today, those fees no longer exist.</p>
<p>A security freeze essentially blocks any potential creditors from being able to view or “pull” your credit file, unless you affirmatively unfreeze or thaw your file beforehand. With a freeze in place on your credit file, ID thieves can apply for credit in your name all they want, but they will not succeed in getting new lines of credit in your name because few if any creditors will extend that credit without first being able to gauge how risky it is to loan to you (i.e., view your credit file).</p>
<p>And because each credit inquiry caused by a creditor has the potential to lower your credit score, the freeze also helps protect your score, which is what most lenders use to decide whether to grant you credit when you truly do want it and apply for it.</p>
<p>To file a freeze, consumers must contact each of the three major credit bureaus online, by phone or by mail. Here&#8217;s the updated contact information for the big three:</p>
<p>Online: <a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equifax Freeze Page</a><br />
By phone: 800-685-1111<br />
By Mail: Equifax Security Freeze<br />
P.O. Box 105788<br />
Atlanta, Georgia 30348-5788</p>
<p>Online: <a href="https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html#content-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experian</a><br />
By phone: 888-397-3742<br />
By Mail: Experian Security Freeze<br />
P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013</p>
<p>Online: <a href="https://service.transunion.com/dss/orderStep1_form.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TransUnion</a><br />
By Phone: 888-909-8872<br />
By Mail: TransUnion LLC<br />
P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016</p>
<p>Spouses may request freezes for each other by phone as long as they pass authentication.</p>
<p>The new law also makes it free to place, thaw and lift freezes for dependents under the age of 16, or for incapacitated adult family members. However, this process is not currently available online or by phone, as it requires parents/guardians to submit written documentation (&#8220;sufficient proof of authority&#8221;), such as a copy of a birth certificate and copy of a Social Security card issued by the Social Security Administration, or &#8212; in the case of an incapacitated family member &#8212; proof of power of attorney.</p>
<p>In addition, the law requires the big three bureaus to offer free electronic credit monitoring services to all active duty military personnel. It also changes the rules for “<strong>fraud alerts</strong>,” which currently are free but only last for 90 days. With a fraud alert on your credit file, lenders or service providers should not grant credit in your name without first contacting you to obtain your approval — by phone or whatever other method you specify when you apply for the fraud alert.</p>
<p>Another important change: Fraud alerts now last for one year (previously they lasted just 90 days) but consumers can renew them each year. Bear in mind, however, that while lenders and service providers are supposed to seek and obtain your approval before granting credit in your name if you have a fraud alert on your file, they’re not legally required to do this. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/#more-45121" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Citing &#8220;extraordinary cooperation&#8221; with the government, a court in Alaska on Tuesday sentenced three men to probation, community service and fines for their admitted roles in authoring and using &#8220;<strong>Mirai</strong>,&#8221; a potent malware strain used in countless attacks designed to knock Web sites offline &#8212; including an enormously powerful attack in 2016 that sidelined this Web site for nearly four days.</p>
<p>The men &#8212; 22-year-old<strong> Paras Jha</strong> Fanwood, New Jersey,  <strong>Josiah White, </strong>21 of Washington, Pa., and<strong> Dalton Norman </strong>from Metairie, La<strong>. </strong>&#8212; were each sentenced to five years probation, 2,500 hours of community service, and ordered to pay $127,000 in restitution for the damage caused by their malware.</p>
<p>Mirai enslaves poorly secured &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) devices like security cameras, digital video recorders (DVRs) and routers for use in large-scale online attacks.</p>
<p>Not long after Mirai first surfaced online in August 2016, White and Jha were questioned by the FBI about their suspected role in developing the malware. At the time, the men were renting out slices of their botnet to other cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Weeks later, the defendants sought to distance themselves from their creation by releasing the Mirai source code online. That action quickly spawned dozens of copycat Mirai botnets, some of which were used in extremely powerful denial-of-service attacks that often caused widespread collateral damage beyond their intended targets.</p>
<div id="attachment_36755" style="width: 601px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36755" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-36755" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png" alt="" width="591" height="336" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /><p id="caption-attachment-36755" class="wp-caption-text">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai attacks on Dyn, an Internet infrastructure company. Source: Downdetector.com.</p></div>
<p>The source code release also marked a period in which the three men began using their botnet for far more subtle and less noisy criminal moneymaking schemes, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click fraud</a> — a form of online advertising fraud that costs advertisers billions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>In September 2016, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was hit with a record-breaking denial-of-service attack</a> from tens of thousands of Mirai-infected devices, forcing this site offline for several days. Using the pseudonym &#8220;Anna_Senpai,&#8221; Jha admitted to a friend at the time that the attack on this site was paid for by a customer who rented tens of thousands of Mirai-infected systems from the trio.</p>
<p>In January 2017, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published the results of a four-month investigation into Mirai</a> which named both Jha and White as the likely co-authors of the malware.  Eleven months later, the U.S. Justice Department <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/mirai-iot-botnet-co-authors-plead-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced guilty pleas</a> by Jha, White and Norman. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/mirai-botnet-authors-avoid-jail-time/#more-45108" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Government Payment Service Inc. </strong>— a company used by thousands of U.S. state and local governments to accept online payments for everything from traffic citations and licensing fees to bail payments and court-ordered fines — has leaked more than 14 million customer records dating back at least six years, including names, addresses, phone numbers and the last four digits of the payer&#8217;s credit card.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/govpaynet.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45095" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/govpaynet.png" alt="" width="584" height="377" /></a></p>
<p>Indianapolis-based <strong>GovPayNet</strong>, doing business online as <a href="https://www.govpaynow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GovPayNow.com</a>, serves approximately <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=ABqgW-DGJdCf_Qat-42ACQ&amp;q=link%3Agovpaynow.com&amp;oq=link%3Agovpaynow.com&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...9236.9535..9701...0.0..0.136.386.0j3......0....1..gws-wiz.eKm86bYw5yE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,300 government agencies in 35 states</a>. GovPayNow.com displays an online receipt when citizens use it to settle state and local government fees and fines via the site. Until this past weekend it was possible to view millions of customer records simply by altering digits in the Web address displayed by each receipt.</p>
<p>On Friday, Sept. 14, KrebsOnSecurity alerted GovPayNet that its site was exposing at least 14 million customer receipts dating back to 2012. Two days later, the company said it had addressed &#8220;a potential issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>“GovPayNet has addressed a potential issue with our online system that allows users to access copies of their receipts, but did not adequately restrict access only to authorized recipients,&#8221; the company said in a statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity.</p>
<p>The statement continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The company has no indication that any improperly accessed information was used to harm any customer, and receipts do not contain information that can be used to initiate a financial transaction. Additionally, most information in the receipts is a matter of public record that may be accessed through other means. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution and to maximize security for users, GovPayNet has updated this system to ensure that only authorized users will be able to view their individual receipts. We will continue to evaluate security and access to all systems and customer records.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In January 2018, GovPayNet was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180104006153/en/Securus-Technologies-Announces-Acquisition-GovPayNet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by <strong>Securus Technologies</strong>, a Carrollton, Texas- based company that provides telecommunications services to prisons and helps law enforcement personnel keep tabs on mobile devices used by former inmates.</p>
<p>Although its name may suggest otherwise, Securus does not have a great track record in securing data. In May 2018, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/cellphone-tracking-law-enforcement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the news</a> that Securus’ service for tracking the cell phones of convicted felons was being abused by law enforcement agencies to track the real-time location of mobile devices used by people who had only been suspected of committing a crime. The story observed that authorities could use the service to track the real-time location of nearly any mobile phone in North America.</p>
<p>Just weeks later, Motherboard <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gykgv9/securus-phone-tracking-company-hacked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that hackers had broken into Securus’ systems and stolen the online credentials for multiple law enforcement officials who used the company’s systems to track the location of suspects via their mobile phone number.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/mobile-giants-please-dont-share-the-where/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story here on May 22</a> illustrated how Securus&#8217; site appeared to allow anyone to reset the password of an authorized Securus user simply by guessing the answer to one of three pre-selected &#8220;security questions,&#8221; including &#8220;what is your pet name,&#8221; &#8220;what is your favorite color,&#8221; and &#8220;what town were you born in&#8221;. Much like GovPayNet, the Securus Web site seemed to have been erected sometime in the aughts and left to age ungracefully for years.</p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>The four major U.S. wireless carriers today detailed a new initiative that may soon let Web sites eschew passwords and instead authenticate visitors by leveraging data elements unique to each customer&#8217;s phone and mobile subscriber account, such as location, customer reputation, and physical attributes of the device. Here&#8217;s a look at what&#8217;s coming, and the potential security and privacy trade-offs of trusting the carriers to handle online authentication on your behalf.</p>
<p>Tentatively dubbed &#8220;<strong>Project Verify</strong>&#8221; and still in the private beta testing phase, the new authentication initiative is being pitched as a way to give consumers both a more streamlined method of proving one&#8217;s identity when creating a new account at a given Web site, as well as replacing passwords and one-time codes for logging in to existing accounts at participating sites.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a promotional and explanatory video about Project Verify produced by the <a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_sprint_tmobile_and_verizon_unveil_next_generation_mobile_authentication_platform_details.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile Authentication Task Force</a>, whose members include <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Sprint</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHShXwsER0I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>The mobile companies say Project Verify can improve online authentication because they alone have access to several unique signals and capabilities that can be used to validate each customer and their mobile device(s). This includes knowing the approximate real-time location of the customer; how long they have been a customer and used the device in question; and information about components inside the customer&#8217;s phone that are only accessible to the carriers themselves, such as cryptographic signatures tied to the device&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_identity_module" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIM card</a>.</p>
<p>The Task Force currently is working on building its Project Verify app into the software that gets pre-loaded onto mobile devices sold by the four major carriers. The basic idea is that third-party Web sites could let the app (and, by extension, the user&#8217;s mobile provider) handle the process of authenticating the user&#8217;s identity, at which point the app would interactively log the user in without the need of a username and password.</p>
<p>In another example, participating sites could use Project Verify to supplement or replace existing authentication processes, such as two-factor methods that currently rely on sending the user a one-time passcode via SMS/text messages, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim+swap&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which can be intercepted by cybercrooks</a>.</p>
<p>The carriers also are pitching their offering as a way for consumers to pre-populate data fields on a Web site &#8212; such as name, address, credit card number and other information typically entered when someone wants to sign up for a new user account at a Web site or make purchases online.</p>
<p><strong>Johannes Jaskolski</strong>, general manager for Mobile Authentication Task Force and assistant vice president of identity security at AT&amp;T, said the group is betting that Project Verify will be attractive to online retailers partly because it can help them capture more sign-ups and sales from users who might otherwise balk at having to manually provide lots of data via a mobile device.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can be a primary authenticator where, just by authenticating to our app, you can then use that service,&#8221; Jaskolski said. &#8220;That can be on your mobile, but it could also be on another device. With subscriber consent, we can populate that information and make it much more effortless to sign up for or sign into services online. In other markets, we have found this type of approach reduced [customer] fall-out rates, so it can make third-party businesses more successful in capturing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jaskolski said customers who take advantage of Project Verify will be able to choose what types of data get shared between their wireless provider and a Web site on a per-site basis, or opt to share certain data elements across the board with sites that leverage the app for authentication and e-commerce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many companies already rely on the mobile device today in their customer authentication flows, but what we&#8217;re saying is there&#8217;s going to be a better way to do this in a method that is intended from the start to serve authentication use cases,&#8221; Jaskolski said. &#8220;This is what everyone has been seeking from us already in co-opting other mobile features that were simply never designed for authentication.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/u-s-mobile-giants-want-to-be-your-online-identity/#more-45035" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Adobe</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> today each released patches to fix serious security holes in their software. Adobe pushed out a new version of its beleaguered <strong>Flash Player</strong> browser plugin. Redmond issued updates to address at least 61 distinct vulnerabilities in <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> and related programs, including several flaws that were publicly detailed prior to today and one &#8220;zero-day&#8221; bug in Windows that is already being actively exploited by attackers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-19861" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/crackedwin.png" alt="" width="212" height="251" />As per usual, the bulk of the fixes from Microsoft tackle security weaknesses in the company&#8217;s Web browsers, <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> and <strong>Edge</strong>. Patches also are available for Windows, <strong>Office</strong>, <strong>Sharepoint</strong>, and the <strong>.NET Framework</strong>, among other components.</p>
<p>Of the 61 bugs fixed in this patch batch, 17 earned Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;critical&#8221; rating, meaning malware or miscreants could use them to break into Windows computers with little or no help from users.</p>
<p>The zero-day flaw, <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8440</a>, affects Microsoft operating systems from <strong>Windows 7</strong> through <strong>Windows 10</strong> and allows a program launched by a restricted Windows user to gain more powerful administrative access on the system. It was first publicized August 27 in a (now deleted) Twitter post that linked users to proof-of-concept code hosted on <strong>Github</strong>. Since then, security experts have spotted versions of the code <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/05/powerpool-malware-exploits-zero-day-vulnerability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being used in active attacks</a>.</p>
<p>According to security firm <a href="https://www.ivanti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivanti</a>, prior to today bad guys got advance notice about three vulnerabilities in Windows targeted by these patches. The first, <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8457</a>, is a critical memory corruption issue that could be exploited through a malicious Web site or Office file. <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8475</a> is a critical bug in most supported versions of Windows that can be used for nasty purposes by getting a user to view a specially crafted image file. The third previously disclosed flaw, <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8409</a>, is a somewhat less severe &#8220;denial-of-service&#8221; vulnerability. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/patch-tuesday-september-2018-edition/#more-44969" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Later this month, all of the three major consumer credit bureaus will be required to offer free credit freezes to all Americans and their dependents. Maybe you&#8217;ve been holding off freezing your credit file because your home state currently charges a fee for placing or thawing a credit freeze, or because you believe it&#8217;s just not worth the hassle. If that accurately describes your views on the matter, this post may well change your mind.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-40941" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/creditfreeze.png" alt="" width="582" height="239" /></p>
<p>A credit freeze &#8212; also known as a &#8220;security freeze&#8221; &#8212; restricts access to your credit file, making it far more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name.</p>
<p>Currently, many states allow the big three bureaus &#8212; <strong>Equifax</strong>, <strong>Experian</strong> and <strong>TransUnion</strong> &#8212; to charge a fee for placing or lifting a security freeze. But thanks to a federal law enacted earlier this year, after Sept. 21, 2018 it will be free to freeze and unfreeze your credit file and those of your children or dependents throughout the United States.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has for many years urged readers to freeze their files with the big three bureaus, as well as with a distant fourth &#8212; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-what-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innovis</a> &#8212; and the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/another-credit-freeze-target-nctue-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCTUE</a>, an Equifax-operated credit checking clearinghouse relied upon by most of the major mobile phone providers.</p>
<p>There are dozens of private companies that specialize in providing consumer credit reports and scores to specific industries, including real estate brokers, landlords, insurers, debt buyers, employers, banks, casinos and retail stores. <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201604_cfpb_list-of-consumer-reporting-companies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A handy PDF</a> produced earlier this year by the <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau </strong>(CFPB) lists all of the known entities that maintain, sell or share credit data on U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>The CFPB&#8217;s document includes <em>links to Web sites for 46 different consumer credit reporting entities</em>, along with information about your legal rights to obtain data in your reports and dispute suspected inaccuracies with the companies as needed. My guess is the vast majority of Americans have never heard of most of these companies.</p>
<p>Via numerous front-end Web sites, each of these mini credit bureaus serve thousands or tens of thousands of people who work in the above mentioned industries and who have the ability to pull credit and other personal data on Americans. In many cases, online access to look up data through these companies is secured by nothing more than a username and password that can be stolen or phished by cybercrooks and abused to pull privileged information on consumers.</p>
<p>In other cases, it&#8217;s trivial for anyone to sign up for these services. For example, how do companies that provide background screening and credit report data to landlords decide who can sign up as a landlord? Answer: Anyone can be a landlord (or pretend to be one).</p>
<h4>SCORE ONE FOR FREEZES</h4>
<p>The truly scary part? Access to some of these credit lookup services is supposed to be secured behind a login page, but often isn&#8217;t. Consider the service pictured below, which for $44 will let anyone look up the credit score of any American who hasn&#8217;t already frozen their credit files with the big three. Worse yet, you don&#8217;t even need to have accurate information on a target &#8212; such as their Social Security number or current address.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45053" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/crof.png" alt="" width="586" height="743" /></p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was made aware of this particular portal by <strong>Alex Holden</strong>, CEO of Milwaukee, Wisc.-based cybersecurity firm <a href="http://www.holdsecurity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hold Security LLC</a> [full disclosure: This author is listed as an adviser to Hold Security, however this is and always has been a volunteer role for which I have not been compensated].</p>
<p>Holden&#8217;s wife Lisa is a mortgage broker, and as such she has access to a more full-featured version of the above-pictured consumer data lookup service (among others) for the purposes of helping clients determine a range of mortgage rates available. Mrs. Holden said the version of this service that she has access to will return accurate, current and complete credit file information on consumers even if one enters a made-up SSN and old address on an individual who hasn&#8217;t yet frozen their credit files with the big three.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed in the past when I do a hard pull on someone&#8217;s credit report and the buyer gave me the wrong SSN or transposed some digits, not only will these services give me their credit report and full account history, it also tells you what their correct SSN is,&#8221; Mrs. Holden said.</p>
<p>With Mr. Holden&#8217;s permission, I gave the site pictured above an old street address for him plus a made-up SSN, and provided my credit card number to pay for the report. The document generated by that request said TransUnion and Experian were unable to look up his credit score with the information provided. However, Equifax not only provided his current credit score, it helpfully corrected the false data I entered for Holden, providing the last four digits of his real SSN and current address.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume our credit report is keyed off of our SSN or something unique about ourselves,&#8221; Mrs. Holden said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s really keyed off your White Pages information, meaning anyone can get your credit report if they are in the know.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was pleased to find that I was unable to pull my own credit score through this exposed online service, although the site still charged me $44. The report produced simply said the consumer in question had requested that access to this information be restricted. But the real reason was simply that I&#8217;ve had my credit file frozen for years now.</p>
<p>Many media outlets are publishing stories this week about the one-year anniversary of the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=equifax+breach&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breach at Equifax</a> that exposed the personal and financial data on more than 147 million people. But it’s important for everyone to remember that as bad as the Equifax breach was (and it was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a total dumpster fire all around</a>), most of the consumer data exposed in the breach has been for sale in the cybercrime underground for many years on a majority of Americans &#8212; including access to consumer credit reports. If anything, the Equifax breach may have simply helped ID thieves refresh some of those criminal data stores.</p>

												<p>A 19-year-old man from the United Kingdom who headed a cybercriminal group whose motto was &#8220;Feds Can&#8217;t Touch Us&#8221; pleaded guilty this week to making bomb threats against thousands of schools.</p>
<p>On Aug. 31, officers with the U.K.&#8217;s <strong>National Crime Agency</strong> (NCA) arrested Hertfordshire resident <strong>George Duke-Cohan, </strong>who admitted making bomb threats to thousands of schools and a <strong>United Airlines</strong> flight traveling from the U.K. to San Francisco last month.</p>
<div id="attachment_45027" style="width: 558px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45027" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-45027" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/apophis-tweet.png" alt="" width="548" height="442" /><p id="caption-attachment-45027" class="wp-caption-text">One of many tweets from the attention-starved Apophis Squad, which launched multiple DDoS attacks against KrebsOnsecurity and Protonmail over the past few months.</p></div>
<p>Duke-Cohan &#8212; a.k.a. &#8220;7R1D3N7,&#8221; &#8220;DoubleParallax&#8221; and &#8220;Optcz1&#8221; &#8212; was among the most vocal members of a group of Internet hooligans that goes by the name &#8220;<strong>Apophis Squad</strong>,&#8221; which for the better part of 2018 has been launching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks against multiple Web sites, including KrebsOnSecurity and <strong>Protonmail.com</strong>.</p>
<p>Incredibly, all self-described members of Duke-Cohan&#8217;s clique were active users of Protonmail, even as they repeatedly attacked its servers and taunted the company on social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found, combined with intelligence provided by renowned <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ss1536244197="1">cyber security journalist Brian Krebs</a>, allowed us to conclusively identify Duke-Cohan as a member of Apophis Squad in the first week of August, and we promptly informed law enforcement,&#8221; Protonmail wrote in a blog post published today. &#8220;British police did not move to immediately arrest Duke-Cohan however, and we believe there were good reasons for that. Unfortunately, this meant that through much of August, ProtonMail remained under attack, but due to the efforts of Radware, ProtonMail users saw no impact.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/leader-of-ddos-for-hire-gang-pleads-guilty-to-bomb-threats/#more-45025" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Popular file-sharing site <strong>Mega.nz</strong> is warning users that cybercriminals hacked its browser extension for <strong>Google Chrome</strong> so that usernames and passwords submitted through the browser were copied and forwarded to a rogue server in Ukraine. This attack serves as a fresh reminder that legitimate browser extensions can and periodically do fall into the wrong hands, and that it makes good security sense to limit your exposure to such attacks by getting rid of extensions that are no longer useful or actively maintained by developers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45005" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/browsers.png" alt="" width="583" height="107" /></p>
<p>In <a href="https://mega.nz/blog_47" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement posted to its Web site</a>, Mega.nz said the extension for Chrome was compromised after its Chrome Web store account was hacked. From their post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On 4 September 2018 at 14:30 UTC, an unknown attacker uploaded a trojaned version of MEGA&#8217;s Chrome extension, version 3.39.4, to the Google Chrome webstore. Upon installation or autoupdate, it would ask for elevated permissions (Read and change all your data on the websites you visit) that MEGA&#8217;s real extension does not require and would (if permissions were granted) exfiltrate credentials for sites including <strong>amazon.com</strong>, <strong>live.com</strong>, <strong>github.com</strong>, <strong>google.com</strong> (for webstore login), <strong>myetherwallet.com</strong>, <strong>mymonero.com</strong>, <strong>idex.market</strong> and HTTP POST requests to other sites, to a server located in Ukraine. Note that mega.nz credentials were not being exfiltrated.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browser extensions</a> can be incredibly handy and useful, but compromised extensions &#8212; depending on the level of &#8220;permissions&#8221; or access originally granted to them &#8212; <em>also can give attackers access to all data on your computer and the Web sites you visit</em>.</p>
<p>For its part, Google tries to communicate the potential risk of extensions using three &#8220;alert&#8221; levels: Low, medium and high, as detailed in the screenshot below. In practice, however, most extensions carry the medium or high alert level, which means that if the extension is somehow compromised (or malicious from the get-go), the attacker in control of it is going to have access to ton of sensitive information on a great many Internet users. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/browser-extensions-are-they-worth-the-risk/#more-44999" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>mSpy</strong>, the makers of a software-as-a-service product that claims to help more than a million paying customers spy on the mobile devices of their kids and partners, has leaked millions of sensitive records online, including passwords, call logs, text messages, contacts, notes and location data secretly collected from phones running the stealthy spyware.</p>
<p>Less than a week ago, security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/IamNitishShah" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nitish Shah</strong></a> directed KrebsOnSecurity to an open database on the Web that allowed anyone to query up-to-the-minute mSpy records for both customer transactions at mSpy&#8217;s site and for mobile phone data collected by mSpy&#8217;s software. The database required no authentication.</p>
<div id="attachment_44971" style="width: 595px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mspy-nojb.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44971" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-44971" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mspy-nojb.png" alt="" width="585" height="352" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-44971" class="wp-caption-text">A list of data points that can be slurped from a mobile device that is secretly running mSpy&#8217;s software.</p></div>
<p>Before it was taken offline sometime in the past 12 hours, the database contained millions of records, including the username, password and private encryption key of each mSpy customer who logged in to the mSpy site or purchased an mSpy license over the past six months. The private key would allow anyone to track and view details of a mobile device running the software, Shah said.</p>
<p>In addition, the database included the <strong>Apple iCloud</strong> username and authentication token of mobile devices running mSpy, and what appear to be references to iCloud backup files. Anyone who stumbled upon this database also would have been able to browse the <strong>Whatsapp</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> messages uploaded from mobile devices equipped with mSpy.</p>
<div id="attachment_44979" style="width: 597px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a class="lightbox" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mspypass.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44979" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-44979" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mspypass.png" alt="" width="587" height="278" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-44979" class="wp-caption-text">Usernames, passwords, text messages and loads of other more personal details were leaked from mobile devices running mSpy.</p></div>
<p>Other records exposed included the transaction details of all mSpy licenses purchased over the last six months, including customer name, email address, mailing address and amount paid. Also in the data set were mSpy user logs &#8212; including the browser and Internet address information of people visiting the mSpy Web site.</p>
<p>Shah said when he tried to alert mSpy of his findings, the company&#8217;s support personnel ignored him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was chatting with their live support, until they blocked me when I asked them to get me in contact with their CTO or head of security,&#8221; Shah said.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity alerted mSpy about the exposed database on Aug. 30. This morning I received an email from mSpy&#8217;s chief security officer, who gave only his first name, &#8220;Andrew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been working hard to secure our system from any possible leaks, attacks, and private information disclosure,&#8221; Andrew wrote. &#8220;All our customers’ accounts are securely encrypted and the data is being wiped out once in a short period of time. Thanks to you we have prevented this possible breach and from what we could discover the data you are talking about could be some amount of customers’ emails and possibly some other data. However, we could only find that there were only a few points of access and activity with the data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of those &#8220;points of access&#8221; were mine. In fact, because mSpy&#8217;s Web site access logs were leaked I could view evidence of my own activity on their site in real-time via the exposed database, as could Shah of his own poking around.</p>
