												<p><strong>Ubiquiti</strong>, a major vendor of cloud-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as routers, network video recorders, security cameras and access control systems, is urging customers to change their passwords and enable multi-factor authentication. The company says an incident at a third-party cloud provider may have exposed customer account information and credentials used to remotely manage Ubiquiti gear.</p>
<p>In an email sent to customers today, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquiti_Networks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ubiquiti Inc.</a> [<a href="https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:UI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NYSE: UI</a>] said it recently became aware of &#8220;unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems hosted by a third party cloud provider,&#8221; although it declined to name that provider.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-54003" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ubi-notice.png" alt="" width="600" height="633" /></p>
<p>The statement continues:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not currently aware of evidence of access to any databases that host user data, but we cannot be certain that user data has not been exposed. This data may include your name, email address, and the one-way encrypted password to your account (in technical terms, the passwords are hashed and salted). The data may also include your address and phone number if you have provided that to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ubiquiti has not yet responded to requests for more information, but the notice was confirmed as official in <a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Account-Notification/96467115-49b5-4dd6-9517-f8cdbf6906f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the company&#8217;s user support forum</a>.</p>
<p>The warning from Ubiquiti carries particular significance because the company has made it fairly difficult for customers using the latest Ubiquiti firmware to interact with their devices without first authenticating through the company&#8217;s cloud-based systems. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/ubiquiti-change-your-password-enable-2fa/#more-53996" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>The ongoing breach affecting thousands of organizations that relied on backdoored products by network software firm <strong>SolarWinds</strong> may have jeopardized the privacy of countless sealed court documents on file with the U.S. federal court system, according to a memo released Wednesday by the <strong>Administrative Office (AO) of the U.S. Courts</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53985" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/uscourts.png" alt="" width="593" height="320" /></p>
<p>The judicial branch agency said it will be deploying more stringent controls for receiving and storing sensitive documents filed with the federal courts, following a discovery that its own systems were compromised as part of the SolarWinds supply chain attack. That intrusion involved malicious code being surreptitiously inserted into updates shipped by SolarWinds for some 18,000 users of its <strong>Orion</strong> network management software as far back as March 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AO is working with the Department of Homeland Security on a security audit relating to vulnerabilities in the Judiciary’s <strong>Case Management/Electronic Case Files</strong> system (CM/ECF) that greatly risk compromising highly sensitive non-public documents stored on CM/ECF, particularly sealed filings,&#8221; the agency said in <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2021/01/06/judiciary-addresses-cybersecurity-breach-extra-safeguards-protect-sensitive-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement</a> published Jan. 6.</p>
<p>&#8220;An apparent compromise of the confidentiality of the CM/ECF system due to these discovered vulnerabilities currently is under investigation,&#8221; the statement continues. &#8220;Due to the nature of the attacks, the review of this matter and its impact is ongoing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The AO declined to comment on specific questions about their breach disclosure. But a source close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that the federal court document system was &#8220;hit hard,&#8221; by the SolarWinds attackers, which multiple U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/01/05/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have attributed as &#8220;likely Russian in origin.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The source said the intruders behind the SolarWinds compromise seeded the AO&#8217;s network with <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a second stage &#8220;Teardrop&#8221; malware</a> that went beyond the &#8220;Sunburst&#8221; malicious software update that was opportunistically pushed out to all 18,000 customers using the compromised Orion software. This suggests the attackers were targeting the agency for deeper access to its networks and communications.</p>
<p>The AO&#8217;s court document system powers a publicly searchable database called <a href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PACER</a>, and the vast majority of the files in PACER are not restricted and are available to anyone willing to pay for the records.</p>
<p>But experts say many other documents stored in the AO&#8217;s system are sealed &#8212; either temporarily or indefinitely by the courts or parties to a legal matter &#8212; and may contain highly sensitive information, including intellectual property and trade secrets, or even the identities of confidential informants.</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong>, a lecturer at the computer science department at University of California, Berkeley, said the court document system doesn&#8217;t hold documents that are classified for national security reasons. But he said the system is full of sensitive sealed filings &#8212; such as subpoenas for email records and so-called &#8220;trap and trace&#8221; requests that law enforcement officials use to determine with whom a suspect is communicating via phone, when and for how long.</p>
<p><span class="pullquote pqleft">&#8220;This would be a treasure trove for the Russians knowing about a lot of ongoing criminal investigations,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;If the FBI has indicted someone but hasn&#8217;t arrested them yet, that&#8217;s all under seal.</span> A lot of the investigative tools that get protected under seal are filed very early on in the process, often with gag orders that prevent [the subpoenaed party] from disclosing the request.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acknowledgement from the AO comes hours after the <strong>U.S. Justice Department</strong> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/doj-says-solarwinds-hackers-breached-its-office-365-system-and-read-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said it also was a victim of the SolarWinds intruders</a>, who took control over the department&#8217;s <strong>Office 365</strong> system and accessed email sent or received from about three percent of DOJ accounts (the department has more than 100,000 employees). <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/sealed-u-s-court-records-exposed-in-solarwinds-breach/#more-53980" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Like countless others, I frittered away the better part of Jan. 6 doomscrolling and watching television coverage of the horrifying events unfolding in our nation&#8217;s capital, where a mob of <strong>President Trump</strong> supporters and <strong>QAnon</strong> conspiracy theorists was incited to lay siege to the U.S. Capitol. For those trying to draw meaning from the experience, might I suggest consulting the literary classic <em>Moby Dick</em>, which simultaneously holds clues about QAnon&#8217;s origins and offers an apt allegory about a modern-day <strong>Captain Ahab</strong> and his ill-fated obsessions.</p>
<p>Many have speculated that <strong>Jim Watkins</strong>, the administrator of the online message board <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8chan</a> (a.k.a. 8kun), and/or his son <strong>Ron</strong> are in fact &#8220;Q,&#8221; the anonymous persona behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QAnon conspiracy theory</a>, which holds that <strong>President Trump</strong> is secretly working to save the world from a satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.</p>
<p>Last year, as I was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/qanon-8chan-sites-briefly-knocked-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scrutinizing the computer networks that kept QAnon online</a>, researcher <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ron+guilmette&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Guilmette</a> pointed out a tantalizing utterance from Watkins the younger which adds tenuous credence to the notion that one or both of them is Q.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53946" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mobydick.png" alt="" width="525" height="767" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll get to how the Great White Whale (the Capitol?) fits into this tale in a moment. But first, a bit of background. A person identified only as &#8220;Q&#8221; has for years built an impressive following for the far-right conspiracy movement by leaving periodic &#8220;Q drops,&#8221; cryptic messages that QAnon adherents spend much time and effort trying to decipher and relate to current events.</p>
<p>Researchers who have studied more than 5,000 Q drops <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqj7x/qanons-mysterious-leader-q-is-actually-multiple-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are convinced that there are two distinct authors of these coded utterances</a>. The <a href="https://www.insider.com/who-is-q-why-people-think-jim-watkins-qanon-8chan-2020-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading theory</a> is that those identities corresponded to the aforementioned father-and-son team responsible for operating 8chan.</p>
<p>Jim Watkins, 56, is the current owner of 8chan, a community perhaps now best known as a forum for violent extremists and mass shooters. Watkins is an American pig farmer based in the Philippines; Ron reportedly resides in Japan.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of back-to-back mass shootings on Aug. 3 and Aug. 4, 2019 in which a manifesto justifying one of the attacks was uploaded to 8chan, Cloudflare stopped providing their content delivery network to 8chan. Several other providers quickly followed suit, leaving 8chan offline for months before it found a haven at <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/07/meet-the-worlds-biggest-bulletproof-hoster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a notorious bulletproof hosting facility in Russia</a>.</p>
<p>One reason Q watchers believe Ron and Jim Watkins may share authorship over the Q drops is that while 8chan was offline, the messages from Q ceased. The drops reappeared only months later when 8chan rebranded as 8kun.</p>
<h4>CALL ME ISHMAEL</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the admittedly &#8220;Qonspiratorial&#8221; clue about the Watkins&#8217; connection to Q comes in. On Aug. 5, 2019, Ron Watkins posted <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeMonkeyZ/status/1158428991755128832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1158428991755128832%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2F8chan-down%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Twitter message</a> about 8chan&#8217;s ostracization which compared the community&#8217;s fate to that of the <strong>Pequod</strong>, the name of the doomed whaling ship in the Herman Melville classic &#8220;<em>Moby Dick</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are still down in a few hours then maybe 8chan will just go clearnet and we can brave DDOS attacks like Ishmael on the Pequod,&#8221; Watkins the younger wrote.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53945" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ron-pequod.png" alt="" width="598" height="133" /></p>
<p>Ishmael, the first-person narrator in the novel, is a somewhat disaffected American sailor who decides to try his hand at a whaling ship. Ishmael is a bit of a minor character in the book; very soon into the novel we are introduced to a much more interesting and enigmatic figure &#8212; a Polynesian harpooner by the name of <strong></strong><strong>Q</strong>uee<strong></strong><strong>q</strong>ueg.</p>
<p>Apart from being a cannibal from the Pacific islands who has devoured many people, Queequeg is a pretty nice guy and shows Ismael the ropes of whaling life. Queequeg is covered head to toe in tattoos, which are described by the narrator as the work of a departed prophet and seer from the cannibal&#8217;s home island.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-53949" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/qq.png" alt="" width="193" height="344" />Like so many Q drops, Queequeg&#8217;s tattoos tell a mysterious tale, but we never quite learn what that full story is. Indeed, the artist who etched them into Queequeg&#8217;s body is long dead, and the cannibal himself can&#8217;t seem to explain what it all means.</p>
<p>Ishmael describes Queequeg&#8217;s mysterious markings in this passage:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;a complete theory of the heavens and earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/01/all-aboard-the-pequod/#more-53942" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In October 2020, KrebsOnSecurity looked at how a web of sites connected to conspiracy theory movements <strong>QAnon</strong> and <strong>8chan</strong> were being kept online by <strong>DDoS-Guard</strong>, a dodgy Russian firm that also hosts the official site for the terrorist group <strong>Hamas</strong>. New research shows DDoS-Guard relies on data centers provided by a U.S.-based publicly traded company, which experts say could be exposed to civil and criminal liabilities as a result of DDoS-Guard&#8217;s business with Hamas.</p>
<div id="attachment_53382" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53382" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-53382" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png" alt="" width="600" height="264" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map.png 1457w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qanon-8kun-map-768x338.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-53382" class="wp-caption-text">Many of the IP address ranges in in this map of QAnon and 8Chan-related sites &#8212; are assigned to VanwaTech.

<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/qanon-8chan-sites-briefly-knocked-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last year&#8217;s story</a> examined how a phone call to Oregon-based <strong>CNServers</strong> was all it took to briefly sideline multiple websites related to 8chan/8kun — a controversial online image board linked to several mass shootings — and QAnon, the far-right conspiracy theory which holds that a cabal of Satanic pedophiles is running a global child sex-trafficking ring and plotting against President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>From that piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>A large number of 8kun and QAnon-related sites (see map above) are connected to the Web via a single Internet provider in Vancouver, Wash. called <strong>VanwaTech</strong> (a.k.a. “OrcaTech“). Previous appeals to VanwaTech to disconnect these sites have fallen on deaf ears, as the company’s owner <strong>Nick Lim</strong> reportedly has been working with 8kun’s administrators to keep the sites online in the name of protecting free speech.</p></blockquote>
<p>After that story, CNServers and a U.K.-based hosting firm called<strong> SpartanHost</strong> both cut ties with VanwaTech. Following a brief disconnection, the sites came back online with the help of DDoS-Guard, an Internet company based in Russia. DDoS-Guard is now VanwaTech&#8217;s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HE-vanwatech.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sole connection to the larger Internet</a>.</p>
<p>A review of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xQaEih4MUqenJlOVbRNm4oA5U8xQVaJCL2rJQ_iv6fI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the several thousand websites hosted by DDoS-Guard</a> is revelatory, as it includes a vast number of phishing sites and domains tied to cybercrime services or forums online.</p>
<p>Replying to requests for comment from a <strong>CBSNews</strong> reporter following up on my Oct. 2020 story, DDoS-Guard issued <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamKates/status/1319264520595001344/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement</a> saying, &#8220;We observe network neutrality and are convinced that any activity not prohibited by law in our country has the right to exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>But experts say DDoS-Guard&#8217;s business arrangement with a Denver-based publicly traded data center firm could create legal headaches for the latter thanks to the Russian company&#8217;s support of Hamas.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ddos-guard.net/en/info/blog-detail/internet-shield-over-the-city-of-angels-ddos-guard-announces-the-launch-of-a-traffic-scrubbing-center-in-los-angeles-ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a> issued in late 2019, DDoS-Guard said its services rely in part on a traffic-scrubbing facility in Los Angeles owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreSite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoreSite</a> [NYSE:COR], a real estate investment trust which invests in &#8220;carrier-neutral data centers and provides colocation and peering services.&#8221;</p>

												<p>Today marks the 11th anniversary of KrebsOnSecurity! Thank you, Dear Readers, for your continued encouragement and support!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-53879" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/eleven.png" alt="" width="250" height="314" />With the ongoing disruption to life and livelihood wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, 2020 has been a fairly horrid year by most accounts. And it&#8217;s perhaps fitting that this was also a leap year, piling on an extra day to a solar rotation that most of us probably can&#8217;t wait to see in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>But it was hardly a dull one for computer security news junkies. In almost every category &#8212; from <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=solar+winds&#038;x=0&#038;y=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">epic breaches</a> and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ransomware+2020&#038;x=0&#038;y=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ransomware</a> to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/neer-do-well-news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cybercrime justice</a> and increasingly aggressive <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=phishing+2020&#038;x=0&#038;y=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">phishing</a> and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=social+engineering+2020&#038;x=0&#038;y=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social engineering scams</a> &#8212; 2020 was a year that truly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7-5io1muSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went to eleven</a>.</p>
<p>Almost 150 stories here this past year generated nearly 9,000 responses from readers (although about 6 percent of those <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/trump-fires-security-chief-christopher-krebs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were on just one story</a>). Thank you all for your thoughtful engagement, wisdom, news tips and support.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to reprise a note from last year&#8217;s anniversary post concerning ads. A good chunk of the loyal readers here are understandably security- and privacy-conscious, and many block advertisements by default — including the ads displayed here.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity does not run third-party ads and has no plans to change that; all of the creatives you see on this site are hosted in-house, are purely image-based, and are vetted first by Yours Truly. Love them or hate ’em, these ads help keep the content at KrebsOnSecurity free to any and all readers. If you’re currently blocking ads here, please consider making an exception for this site.</p>

												<p>U.S. government cybersecurity agencies warned this week that the attackers behind the widespread hacking spree stemming from the compromise at network software firm SolarWinds used weaknesses in other, non-SolarWinds products to attack high-value targets. According to sources, among those was a flaw in software virtualization platform <strong>VMware</strong>, which the <strong>U.S. National Security Agency</strong> (NSA) warned on Dec. 7 was being used by Russian hackers to impersonate authorized users on victim networks.</p>
<p>On Dec. 7, 2020, the NSA said &#8220;Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber actors are exploiting a vulnerability in <strong>VMware Access</strong> and <strong>VMware Identity Manager</strong> products, allowing the actors access to protected data and abusing federated authentication.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nsa-vmware.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53856" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nsa-vmware.png" alt="" width="599" height="432" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nsa-vmware.png 1093w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nsa-vmware-768x554.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></a></p>
<p>VMware released <a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a software update</a> to plug the security hole (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2020-4006</a>) on Dec. 3, and said it learned about the flaw from the NSA.</p>
<p>The NSA <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA_VMWARE%20ACCESS_U_OO_195076_20.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advisory</a> (PDF) came less than 24 hours before cyber incident response firm <strong>FireEye</strong> <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> it discovered attackers had broken into its networks and stolen more than 300 proprietary software tools the company developed to help customers secure their networks.</p>
<p>On Dec. 13, FireEye <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disclosed</a> that the incident was the result of the SolarWinds compromise, which involved malicious code being surreptitiously inserted into updates shipped by SolarWinds for users of its <strong>Orion</strong> network management software as far back as March 2020.</p>
<p>In its advisory on the VMware vulnerability, the NSA urged patching it &#8220;as soon as possible,&#8221; specifically encouraging the National Security System, Department of Defense, and defense contractors to make doing so a high priority.</p>
<p>The NSA said that in order to exploit this particular flaw, hackers would already need to have access to a vulnerable VMware device&#8217;s management interface &#8212; i.e., they would need to be on the target&#8217;s internal network (provided the vulnerable VMware interface was not accessible from the Internet). However, the SolarWinds compromise would have provided that internal access nicely.</p>
<p>In response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity, VMware said it has &#8220;received no notification or indication that the CVE 2020-4006 was used in conjunction with the SolarWinds supply chain compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>VMware added that while some of its own networks used the vulnerable SolarWinds Orion software, an investigation has so far revealed no evidence of exploitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we have identified limited instances of the vulnerable SolarWinds Orion software in our environment, our own internal investigation has not revealed any indication of exploitation,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;This has also been confirmed by SolarWinds own investigations to date.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, DHS&#8217;s <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA) released <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sobering alert</a> on the SolarWinds attack, noting that CISA had evidence of additional access vectors other than the SolarWinds Orion platform.</p>
<p>CISA&#8217;s advisory specifically noted that &#8220;one of the principal ways the adversary is accomplishing this objective is by compromising the <strong>Security Assertion Markup Language</strong> (SAML) signing certificate using their escalated Active Directory privileges. Once this is accomplished, the adversary creates unauthorized but valid tokens and presents them to services that trust SAML tokens from the environment. These tokens can then be used to access resources in hosted environments, such as email, for data exfiltration via authorized application programming interfaces (APIs).&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the NSA&#8217;s Dec. 7 advisory said the hacking activity it saw involving the VMware vulnerability &#8220;led to the installation of a web shell and follow-on malicious activity where credentials in the form of SAML authentication assertions were generated and sent to Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), which in turn granted the actors access to protected data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also on Dec. 17, the NSA released <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/17/2002554125/-1/-1/0/AUTHENTICATION_MECHANISMS_CSA_U_OO_198854_20.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a far more detailed advisory</a> explaining how it has seen the VMware vulnerability being used to forge SAML tokens, this time specifically referencing the SolarWinds compromise.</p>
<p>Asked about the potential connection, the NSA said only that &#8220;if malicious cyber actors gain initial access to networks through the SolarWinds compromise, the TTPs [tactics, techniques and procedures] noted in our December 17 advisory may be used to forge credentials and maintain persistent access.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our guidance in this advisory helps detect and mitigate against this, no matter the initial access method,&#8221; the NSA said.</p>

												<p>A key malicious domain name used to control potentially thousands of computer systems compromised via the months-long breach at network monitoring software vendor <strong>SolarWinds</strong> was commandeered by security experts and used as a &#8220;killswitch&#8221; designed to turn the sprawling cybercrime operation against itself, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53842" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ks-red.png" alt="" width="597" height="597" /></p>
<p>Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds disclosed this week that a compromise of its software update servers earlier this year may have resulted in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/solarwinds-hack-could-affect-18k-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">malicious code being pushed to nearly 18,000 customers of its <strong>Orion</strong> platform</a>. Many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214065921/https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. federal agencies and Fortune 500 firms</a> use(d) Orion to monitor the health of their IT networks.</p>
<p>On Dec. 13, cyber incident response firm <strong>FireEye</strong> <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a detailed writeup</a> on the malware infrastructure used in the SolarWinds compromise, presenting evidence that the Orion software was first compromised back in March 2020. FireEye said hacked networks were seen communicating with a malicious domain name &#8212; <strong>avsvmcloud[.]com</strong> &#8212; one of several domains the attackers had set up to control affected systems.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/solarwinds-hack-could-affect-18k-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first reported here on Tuesday</a>, there were signs over the past few days that control over the domain had been transferred to <strong>Microsoft</strong>. Asked about the changeover, Microsoft referred questions to FireEye and to <strong>GoDaddy</strong>, the current domain name registrar for the malicious site.</p>
<p>Today, FireEye responded that the domain seizure was part of a collaborative effort to prevent networks that may have been affected by the compromised SolarWinds software update from communicating with the attackers. What&#8217;s more, the company said the domain was reconfigured to act as a &#8220;killswitch&#8221; that would prevent the malware from continuing to operate in some circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;SUNBURST is the malware that was distributed through SolarWinds software,&#8221; FireEye said in a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;As part of FireEye&#8217;s analysis of SUNBURST, we identified a killswitch that would prevent SUNBURST from continuing to operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Depending on the IP address returned when the malware resolves avsvmcloud[.]com, under certain conditions, the malware would terminate itself and prevent further execution. FireEye collaborated with GoDaddy and Microsoft to deactivate SUNBURST infections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This killswitch will affect new and previous SUNBURST infections by disabling SUNBURST deployments that are still beaconing to avsvmcloud[.]com. However, in the intrusions FireEye has seen, this actor moved quickly to establish additional persistent mechanisms to access to victim networks beyond the SUNBURST backdoor.</p>
<p>This killswitch will not remove the actor from victim networks where they have established other backdoors. However, it will make it more difficult to for the actor to leverage the previously distributed versions of SUNBURST.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It is likely that given their visibility into and control over the malicious domain, Microsoft, FireEye, GoDaddy and others now have a decent idea which companies may still be struggling with SUNBURST infections.</p>
<p>The killswitch revelations came as security researchers said they&#8217;d <a href="https://twitter.com/RedDrip7/status/1339168187619790848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made progress in decoding SUNBURST&#8217;s obfuscated communications methods</a>. Chinese cybersecurity firm <strong>RedDrip Team</strong> published their findings <a href="https://t.co/jsnOldynCV?amp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Github</a>, saying its decoder tool had identified nearly a hundred suspected victims of the SolarWinds/Orion breach, including universities, governments and high tech companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the potential legal fallout for SolarWinds in the wake of this breach continues to worsen. <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/15/solarwinds-russia-breach-stock-trades/?itid=sf_business-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Tuesday</a> that top investors in SolarWinds sold millions of dollars in stock in the days before the intrusion was revealed. SolarWinds&#8217;s stock price has fallen more than 20 percent in the past few days. The Post cited former enforcement officials at the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) saying the sales were likely to prompt an insider trading investigation.</p>

												<p>The still-unfolding breach at network management software firm <strong>SolarWinds</strong> may have resulted in malicious code being pushed to nearly 18,000 customers, the company said in a legal filing on Monday. Meanwhile, <strong>Microsoft</strong> should soon have some idea which and how many SolarWinds customers were affected, as it recently took possession of a key domain name used by the intruders to control infected systems.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53813" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/swlogo.png" alt="" width="512" height="120" /></p>
<p>On Dec. 13, SolarWinds acknowledged that hackers had inserted malware into a service that provided software updates for its <strong>Orion</strong> platform, a suite of products <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214065921/https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broadly used across the U.S. federal government and Fortune 500 firms</a> to monitor the health of their IT networks.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001739942/57108215-4458-4dd8-a5bf-55bd5e34d451.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Dec. 14 filing</a> with the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC), SolarWinds said roughly 33,000 of its more than 300,000 customers were Orion customers, and that fewer than 18,000 customers may have had an installation of the Orion product that contained the malicious code. SolarWinds said the intrusion also compromised its Microsoft Office 365 accounts.</p>
<p>The initial breach disclosure from SolarWinds came five days after cybersecurity incident response firm <strong>FireEye</strong> announced it had suffered an intrusion that resulted in the theft of some 300 proprietary software tools the company provides to clients to help secure their IT operations.</p>
<p>On Dec. 13, FireEye <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a detailed writeup</a> on the malware infrastructure used in the SolarWinds compromise, presenting evidence that the Orion software was first compromised back in March 2020. FireEye didn&#8217;t explicitly say its own intrusion was the result of the SolarWinds hack, but the company confirmed as much to KrebsOnSecurity earlier today.</p>
<p>Also on Dec. 13, news broke that the SolarWinds hack resulted in attackers reading the email communications at the <strong>U.S. Treasury</strong> and <strong>Commerce</strong> departments.</p>
<p>On Dec. 14, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-cyber-usa-dhs-idUSKBN28O2LY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> the SolarWinds intrusion also had been used to infiltrate computer networks at the <strong>U.S. Department of Homeland Security</strong> (DHS). That disclosure came less than 24 hours after DHS&#8217;s <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA) took the unusual step of issuing <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an emergency directive</a> ordering all federal agencies to immediately disconnect the affected Orion products from their networks.</p>
<h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>Security experts have been speculating as to the extent of the damage from the SolarWinds hack, combing through details in the FireEye analysis and elsewhere for <a href="https://github.com/bambenek/research/tree/main/sunburst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clues about how many other organizations may have been hit</a>.</p>
<p>And it seems that Microsoft may now be in perhaps the best position to take stock of the carnage. That&#8217;s because sometime on Dec. 14, the software giant took control over a key domain name &#8212; <strong>avsvmcloud[.]com</strong> &#8212; that was used by the SolarWinds hackers to communicate with systems compromised by the backdoored Orion product updates.</p>

<p>Armed with that access, Microsoft should be able to tell which organizations have IT systems that are still trying to ping the malicious domain. However, because many Internet service providers and affected companies are already blocking systems from accessing that malicious control domain or have disconnected the vulnerable Orion services, Microsoft&#8217;s visibility may be somewhat limited.</p>
<p>Microsoft has a long history of working with federal investigators and the U.S. courts <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=microsoft+takedown&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to seize control over domains involved in global malware menaces</a>, particularly when those sites are being used primarily to attack Microsoft Windows customers.</p>
<p>Microsoft dodged direct questions about its visibility into the malware control domain, suggesting those queries would be better put to FireEye or <strong>GoDaddy</strong> (the current domain registrar for the malware control server). But in <a href="https://twitter.com/securityjones/status/1338885261460008960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a response on Twitter</a>, Microsoft spokesperson <strong>Jeff Jones</strong> seemed to confirm that control of the malicious domain had changed hands. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/solarwinds-hack-could-affect-18k-customers/#more-53791" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Communications at the <strong>U.S. Treasury</strong> and <strong>Commerce Departments</strong> were reportedly compromised by a supply chain attack on <strong>SolarWinds</strong>, a security vendor that helps the federal government and a range of Fortune 500 companies monitor the health of their IT networks. Given the breadth of the company&#8217;s customer base, experts say the incident may be just the first of many such disclosures.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/BigStory12/idUSKBN28N0PG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Reuters story</a>, hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments. Reuters reports the attackers were able to surreptitiously tamper with updates released by SolarWinds for its <a href="https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-How-Orion-Works-sw1625.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orion platform</a>, a suite of network management tools.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a security advisory</a>, Austin, Texas based SolarWinds acknowledged its systems &#8220;experienced a highly sophisticated, manual supply chain attack on SolarWinds Orion Platform software builds for versions 2019.4 HF 5 through 2020.2.1, released between March 2020 and June 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the intrusions at Treasury and Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA) took the unusual step of issuing <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an emergency directive</a> ordering all federal agencies to immediately disconnect the affected Orion products from their networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Treat all hosts monitored by the SolarWinds Orion monitoring software as compromised by threat actors and assume that further persistence mechanisms have been deployed,&#8221; CISA advised.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> by <strong>Microsoft</strong> says the attackers were able to add malicious code to software updates provided by SolarWinds for Orion users. &#8220;This results in the attacker gaining a foothold in the network, which the attacker can use to gain elevated credentials,&#8221; Microsoft wrote.</p>
<p>From there, the attackers would be able to forge single sign-on tokens that impersonate any of the organization&#8217;s existing users and accounts, including highly privileged accounts on the network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using highly privileged accounts acquired through the technique above or other means, attackers may add their own credentials to existing application service principals, enabling them to call APIs with the permission assigned to that application,&#8221; Microsoft explained.</p>
<p>Malicious code added to an Orion software update may have gone undetected by antivirus software and other security tools on host systems thanks in part to guidance from SolarWinds itself. In <a href="https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Files-and-directories-to-exclude-from-antivirus-scanning-for-Orion-Platform-products?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this support advisory</a>, SolarWinds says its products may not work properly unless their file directories are exempted from antivirus scans and group policy object restrictions. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/u-s-treasury-commerce-depts-hacked-through-solarwinds-compromise/#more-53771" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Payment card processing giant <strong>TSYS</strong> suffered a ransomware attack earlier this month. Since then reams of data stolen from the company have been posted online, with the attackers promising to publish more in the coming days. But the company says the malware did not jeopardize card data, and that the incident was limited to administrative areas of its business.</p>

<p>Headquartered in Columbus, Ga., <a href="https://www.tsys.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Total System Services Inc.</a> (TSYS) is the third-largest third-party payment processor for financial institutions in North America, and a major processor in Europe.</p>
<p>TSYS provides payment processing services, merchant services and other payment solutions, including prepaid debit cards and payroll cards. In 2019, TSYS was acquired by financial services firm <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=global+payments&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Payments Inc.</a> [<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gpn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYSE:GPN</a>].</p>
<p>On December 8, the cybercriminal gang responsible for deploying the <strong>Conti</strong> ransomware strain (also known as &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=ryuk&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryuk</a>&#8220;) published more than 10 gigabytes of data that it claimed to have removed from TSYS&#8217;s networks.</p>
<p>Conti is one of several cybercriminal groups that maintains a blog which publishes data stolen from victims in a bid to force the negotiation of ransom payments. The gang claims the data published so far represents just 15 percent of the information it offloaded from TSYS before detonating its ransomware inside the company.</p>
<p>In a written response to requests for comment, TSYS said the attack did not affect systems that handle payment card processing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We experienced a ransomware attack involving systems that support certain corporate back office functions of a legacy <span class="il">TSYS</span> merchant business,&#8221; TSYS said. &#8220;We immediately contained the suspicious activity and the business is operating normally.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/payment-processing-giant-tsys-ransomware-incident-immaterial-to-company/#more-53731" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
