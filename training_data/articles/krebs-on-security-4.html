												<p><strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong> warns that attackers are exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in <strong>Windows 10</strong> and many <strong>Windows Server</strong> versions to seize control over PCs when users open a malicious document or visit a booby-trapped website. There is currently no official patch for the flaw, but Microsoft has released recommendations for mitigating the threat.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56919" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ms-bldg.png" alt="" width="617" height="449" /></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-40444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a security advisory</a> from Redmond, the security hole <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/09/07/microsoft-releases-mitigations-and-workarounds-cve-2021-40444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-40444</a> affects the &#8220;MSHTML&#8221; component of <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> (IE) on <strong>Windows 10</strong> and many <strong>Windows Server</strong> versions. IE been slowly abandoned for more recent Windows browsers like <strong>Edge</strong>, but the same vulnerable component also is used by <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> applications for rendering web-based content.</p>
<p>&#8220;An attacker could craft a malicious ActiveX control to be used by a Microsoft Office document that hosts the browser rendering engine,&#8221; Microsoft wrote. &#8220;The attacker would then have to convince the user to open the malicious document. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft has not yet released a patch for CVE-2021-40444, but says users can mitigate the threat from this flaw by disabling the installation of all ActiveX controls in IE. Microsoft says the vulnerability is currently being used in targeted attacks, although its advisory credits three different entities with reporting the flaw.</p>
<p>On of the researchers credited &#8212; <strong>EXPMON</strong> &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/EXPMON_/status/1435310341689331721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Twitter</a> that it had reproduced the attack on the latest Office 2019 / Office 365 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exploit uses logical flaws so the exploitation is perfectly reliable (&amp; dangerous),&#8221; EXPMON tweeted.</p>
<p>Windows users could see an official fix for the bug as soon as September 14, when Microsoft is slated to release its monthly &#8220;Patch Tuesday&#8221; bundle of security updates. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/microsoft-attackers-exploiting-windows-zero-day-flaw/#more-56914" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>In May 2015, KrebsOnSecurity briefly <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/phishing-gang-is-audacious-manipulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profiled</a> &#8220;<strong>The Manipulaters</strong>,&#8221; the name chosen by a prolific cybercrime group based in Pakistan that was very publicly selling spam tools and a range of services for crafting, hosting and deploying malicious email. Six years later, a review of the social media postings from this group shows they are prospering, while rather poorly hiding their activities behind a software development firm in Lahore that has secretly enabled an entire generation of spammers and scammers.</p>

<p>The Manipulaters&#8217; core brand in the underground is a shared cybercriminal identity named &#8220;<strong>Saim Raza</strong>,&#8221; who for the past decade across dozens of cybercrime sites and forums has peddled a popular spamming and phishing service variously called &#8220;<strong>Fudtools</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Fudpage</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>Fudsender</strong>,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>The common acronym in nearly all of Saim Raza&#8217;s domains over the years &#8212; &#8220;FUD&#8221; &#8212; stands for &#8220;<strong>F</strong>ully <strong>U</strong>n-<strong>D</strong>etectable,&#8221; and it refers to cybercrime resources that will evade detection by security tools like antivirus software or anti-spam appliances.</p>
<div id="attachment_56857" style="width: 775px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56857" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-56857" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit.png" alt="" width="765" height="542" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit.png 1208w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit-768x544.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit-782x553.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56857" class="wp-caption-text">One of several current Fudtools sites run by The Manipulaters.</p></div>
<p>The current website for Saim Raza&#8217;s Fud Tools (above) offers phishing templates or &#8220;scam pages&#8221; for a variety of popular online sites like <strong>Office365</strong> and <strong>Dropbox</strong>. They also sell &#8220;Doc Exploit&#8221; products that bundle malicious software with innocuous Microsoft Office documents; &#8220;scampage hosting&#8221; for phishing sites; a variety of spam blasting tools like <strong>HeartSender;</strong> and software designed to help spammers route their malicious email through compromised sites, accounts and services in the cloud.</p>
<p>For years leading up to 2015, &#8220;<strong>admin@manipulaters.com</strong>&#8221; was the name on the registration records for thousands of scam domains that spoofed some of the world&#8217;s top banks and brand names, but particularly Apple and Microsoft. When confronted about this, The Manipulaters founder <strong>Madih-ullah Riaz</strong> replied, &#8220;We do not deliberately host or allow any phishing or any other abusive website. Regarding phishing, whenever we receive complaint, we remove the services immediately. Also we are running business since 2006.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_56864" style="width: 271px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/manip-firststeps.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56864" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-56864" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/manip-firststeps.png" alt="" width="261" height="386" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-56864" class="wp-caption-text">The IT network of The Manipulaters, circa 2013. Image: Facebook</p></div>
<p>Two years later, KrebsOnSecurity received an email from Riaz asking to have his name and that of his business partner removed from the 2015 story, saying it had hurt his company&#8217;s ability to maintain stable hosting for their stable of domains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We run web hosting business and due to your post we got very serious problems especially no data center was accepting us,&#8221; Riaz wrote in a May 2017 email. &#8220;I can see you post on hard time criminals we are not criminals, at least it was not in our knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riaz said the problem was his company&#8217;s billing system erroneously used The Manipulators&#8217; name and contact information instead of its clients in WHOIS registration records. That oversight, he said, caused many researchers to erroneously attribute to them activity that was coming from just a few bad customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We work hard to earn money and it is my request, 2 years of my name in your wonderful article is enough punishment and we learned from our mistakes,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>The Manipulaters have indeed learned a few new tricks, but keeping their underground operations air-gapped from their real-life identities is mercifully not one of them.</p>
<h2>ZERO OPERATIONAL SECURITY</h2>
<p>Phishing domain names registered to The Manipulaters included an address in Karachi, with the phone number <strong>923218912562</strong>. That same phone number is shared in the WHOIS records for 4,000+ domains registered through <strong>domainprovider[.]work</strong>, a domain controlled by The Manipulaters that appears to be a reseller of another domain name provider.</p>
<p>One of Saim Raza&#8217;s many ads in the cybercrime underground for his Fudtools service promotes the domain <strong>fudpage[.]com</strong>, and the WHOIS records for that domain share the same Karachi phone number. Fudpage&#8217;s WHOIS records list the contact as &#8220;<strong>admin@apexgrand.com</strong>,&#8221; which is another email address used by The Manipulaters to register domains.</p>

<p>As I noted in 2015, The Manipulaters Team used domain name service (DNS) settings from another blatantly fraudulent service called &#8216;<strong>FreshSpamTools[.]eu</strong>,&#8217; which was offered by a fellow Pakistani who also conveniently sold phishing toolkits targeting a number of big banks.</p>
<p>The WHOIS records for FreshSpamTools briefly list the email address <strong>bilal.waddaich@gmail.com</strong>, which corresponds to the email address for a Facebook account of a <strong>Bilal &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Ahmad Warraich</strong> (a.k.a. Bilal Waddaich).</p>

<h2>FUD CO</h2>
<p>The profile image atop Warraich&#8217;s Facebook page is a group photo of current and former We Code Solutions employees. Helpfully, many of the faces in that photo have been tagged and associated with their respective Facebook profiles.</p>
<p>For example, the Facebook profile of <strong>Burhan Ul Haq</strong>, a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Burhan Shaxx</strong>&#8221; says he works in human relations and IT support for We Code Solutions. Scanning through Ul Haq&#8217;s endless selfies on Facebook, it&#8217;s impossible to ignore a series of photos featuring various birthday cakes <em>and the words &#8220;Fud Co&#8221; written in icing on top.</em></p>

<p>Yes, from a review of the Facebook postings of We Code Solutions employees, it appears that for at least the last five years this group has celebrated an anniversary every May with a Fud Co cake, non-alcoholic sparkling wine, and a Fud Co party or group dinner.

												<p>Some of the most successful and lucrative online scams employ a &#8220;low-and-slow&#8221; approach &#8212; avoiding detection or interference from researchers and law enforcement agencies by stealing small bits of cash from many people over an extended period. Here&#8217;s the story of a cybercrime group that compromises up to 100,000 email inboxes per day, and apparently does little else with this access except siphon gift card and customer loyalty program data that can be resold online.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56819" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/atmoney.png" alt="" width="627" height="644" /></p>
<p>The data in this story come from a trusted source in the security industry who has visibility into a network of hacked machines that fraudsters in just about every corner of the Internet are using to anonymize their malicious Web traffic. For the past three years, the source &#8212; we&#8217;ll call him &#8220;Bill&#8221; to preserve his requested anonymity &#8212; has been watching one group of threat actors that is mass-testing millions of usernames and passwords against the world&#8217;s major email providers each day.</p>
<p>Bill said he&#8217;s not sure where the passwords are coming from, but he assumes they are tied to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/the-life-cycle-of-a-breached-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various databases for compromised websites that get posted to password cracking and hacking forums on a regular basis</a>. Bill said this criminal group averages between five and ten million email authentication attempts daily, and comes away with anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 of working inbox credentials.</p>
<p>In about half the cases the credentials are being checked via &#8220;<a href="https://www.nylas.com/blog/nylas-imap-therefore-i-am/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IMAP</a>,&#8221; which is an email standard used by email software clients like Mozilla&#8217;s <strong>Thunderbird</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong>. With his visibility into the proxy network, Bill can see whether or not an authentication attempt succeeds based on the network response from the email provider (e.g. mail server responds &#8220;OK&#8221; = successful access).</p>
<p>You might think that whoever is behind such a sprawling crime machine would use their access <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/the-value-of-a-hacked-email-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to blast out spam, or conduct targeted phishing attacks against each victim&#8217;s contacts</a>. But based on interactions that Bill has had with several large email providers so far, this crime gang merely uses custom, automated scripts that periodically log in and search each inbox for digital items of value that can easily be resold.</p>
<p>And they seem particularly focused on stealing gift card data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes they&#8217;ll log in as much as two to three times a week for months at a time,&#8221; Bill said. &#8220;These guys are looking for low-hanging fruit &#8212; basically cash in your inbox. Whether it&#8217;s related to hotel or airline rewards or just Amazon gift cards, after they successfully log in to the account their scripts start pilfering inboxes looking for things that could be of value.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_56827" style="width: 327px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56827" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-56827" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gcsnips.png" alt="" width="317" height="631" /><p id="caption-attachment-56827" class="wp-caption-text">A sample of some of the most frequent search queries made in a single day by the gift card gang against more than 50,000 hacked inboxes.</p></div>
<p>According to Bill, the fraudsters aren&#8217;t downloading all of their victims&#8217; emails: That would quickly add up to a monstrous amount of data. Rather, they&#8217;re using automated systems to log in to each inbox and search for a variety of domains and other terms related to companies that maintain loyalty and points programs, and/or issue gift cards and handle their fulfillment.</p>
<p>Why go after hotel or airline rewards? Because these accounts can all be cleaned out and deposited onto a gift card number that can be resold quickly online for 80 percent of its value.</p>
<p>&#8220;These guys want that hard digital asset &#8212; the cash that is sitting there in your inbox,&#8221; Bill said. &#8220;You literally just pull cash out of peoples&#8217; inboxes, and then you have all these secondary markets where you can sell this stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s data also shows that this gang is so aggressively going after gift card data that it will routinely seek new gift card benefits on behalf of victims, when that option is available.  For example, many companies now offer employees a &#8220;wellness benefit&#8221; if they can demonstrate they&#8217;re keeping up with some kind of healthy new habit, such as daily gym visits, yoga, or quitting smoking.</p>
<p>Bill said these crooks have figured out a way to tap into those benefits as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of health insurance companies have wellness programs to encourage employees to exercise more, where if you sign up and pledge to 30 push-ups a day for the next few months or something you&#8217;ll get five wellness points towards a $10 Starbucks gift card, which requires 1000 wellness points,&#8221; Bill explained. &#8220;They&#8217;re actually automating the process of replying saying you completed this activity so they can bump up your point balance and get your gift card.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Gift Card Gang&#8217;s Footprint</h2>
<p>How do the compromised email credentials break down in terms of ISPs and email providers? There are victims on nearly all major email networks, but Bill said several large Internet service providers (ISPs) in Germany and France are heavily represented in the compromised email account data.</p>
<p>&#8220;With some of these international email providers we&#8217;re seeing something like 25,000 to 50,000 email accounts a day get hacked,&#8221; Bill said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;re getting popped so heavily.&#8221;</p>
<p>That may sound like a lot of hacked inboxes, but Bill said some of the bigger ISPs represented in his data have tens or hundreds of millions of customers. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/gift-card-gang-extracts-cash-from-100k-inboxes-daily/#more-55319" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Over the past 15 years, a cybercrime anonymity service known as <strong>VIP72</strong> has enabled countless fraudsters to mask their true location online by routing their traffic through millions of malware-infected systems. But roughly two weeks ago, VIP72&#8217;s online storefront &#8212; which ironically enough has remained at the same U.S.-based Internet address for more than a decade &#8212; simply vanished.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-56769" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vip72login.png" alt="" width="756" height="561" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vip72login.png 865w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vip72login-768x570.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vip72login-782x580.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /></p>
<p>Like other anonymity networks marketed largely on cybercrime forums online, VIP72 routes its customers&#8217; traffic through computers that have been hacked and seeded with malicious software. Using services like VIP72, customers can select network nodes in virtually any country, and relay their traffic while hiding behind some unwitting victim&#8217;s Internet address.</p>
<p>The domain <strong>Vip72[.]org</strong> was originally registered in 2006 to &#8220;<strong>Corpse</strong>,&#8221; the handle adopted by a Russian-speaking hacker who gained infamy several years prior for creating and selling an extremely sophisticated online banking trojan called <strong>A311 Death</strong>, a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Haxdoor</strong>,&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Nuclear Grabber</strong>.&#8221; Haxdoor was way ahead of its time in many respects, and it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/technology/25hack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used in multiple million-dollar cyberheists</a> long before multi million-dollar cyberheists became daily front page news.</p>
<div id="attachment_56767" style="width: 774px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56767" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-56767" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prodexa311.png" alt="" width="764" height="436" /><p id="caption-attachment-56767" class="wp-caption-text">An ad circa 2005 for A311 Death, a powerful banking trojan authored by &#8220;Corpse,&#8221; the administrator of the early Russian hacking clique Prodexteam. Image: Google Translate via Archive.org.</p></div>
<p>Between 2003 and 2006, Corpse focused on selling and supporting his Haxdoor malware. Emerging in 2006, VIP72 was clearly one of his side hustles that turned into a reliable moneymaker for many years to come. And it stands to reason that VIP72 was launched with the help of systems already infected with Corpse&#8217;s trojan malware.</p>
<p>The first mention of VIP72 in the cybercrime underground came in 2006 when someone using the handle &#8220;<strong>Revive</strong>&#8221; advertised the service on Exploit, a Russian language hacking forum. Revive established a sales presence for VIP72 on multiple other forums, and the contact details and messages shared privately by that user with other forum members show Corpse and Revive are one and the same.</p>
<p>When asked in 2006 whether the software that powered VIP72 was based on his Corpse software, Revive replied that &#8220;it works on the new Corpse software, specially written for our service.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/15-year-old-malware-proxy-network-vip72-goes-dark/#more-56712" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

							<div class="entry-content">
												<p>In 2018, <strong>Andrew Schober</strong> was digitally mugged for approximately $1 million worth of bitcoin. After several years of working with investigators, Schober says he&#8217;s confident he has located two young men in the United Kingdom responsible for using a clever piece of digital clipboard-stealing malware to siphon his crypto holdings. Schober is now suing each of their parents in a civil case that seeks to extract what their children would not return voluntarily.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-52998" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coinphish.png" alt="" width="663" height="512" /></p>
<p>In a lawsuit filed in Colorado, Schober said the sudden disappearance of his funds in January 2018 prompted him to spend more than $10,000 hiring experts in the field of tracing cryptocurrency transactions. After months of sleuthing, his investigators identified the likely culprits: Two young men in Britain who were both minors at the time of the crime (both are currently studying computer science at U.K. universities).</p>
<p>A forensic investigation of Schober&#8217;s computer found he&#8217;d inadvertently downloaded malicious software after clicking a link posted on Reddit for a purported cryptocurrency wallet application called &#8220;Electrum Atom.&#8221; Investigators determined that the malware was bundled with the benign program, and was <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clipboard-hijacker-malware-monitors-23-million-bitcoin-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed to lie in wait for users to copy a cryptocurrency address to their computer&#8217;s temporary clipboard</a>.</p>
<p>When Schober went to move approximately 16.4 bitcoins from one account to another &#8212; by pasting the lengthy payment address he&#8217;d just copied &#8212; the malware replaced his bitcoin payment address with a different address controlled by the young men.</p>
<p>Schober&#8217;s lawsuit lays out how his investigators traced the stolen funds through cryptocurrency exchanges and on to the two youths in the United Kingdom. In addition, they found one of the defendants &#8212; just hours after Schober&#8217;s bitcoin was stolen &#8212; had posted a message to GitHub asking for help accessing the private key corresponding to the public key of the bitcoin address used by the clipboard-stealing malware.</p>
<p>Investigators found the other defendant had the malware code that was bundled with the Electrum Atom application in his Github code library.</p>
<p>Initially, Schober hoped that the parents of the thieving teens would listen to reason, and simply return the money. So he wrote a letter to the parents of both boys:</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems your son has been using malware to steal money from people online,&#8221; reads the opening paragraph of the letter Schober emailed to the families. &#8220;Losing that money has been financially and emotionally devastating. He might have thought he was playing a harmless joke, but it has had serious consequences for my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Met with continued silence from the parents for many months, Schober filed suit against the kids and their parents in a Colorado court. A copy of the May 2021 complaint is <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schobervthompson.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Now they are responding. One of the defendants &#8212;<strong>Hazel D. Wells</strong> &#8212; just <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pro-se-wells.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a motion</a> with the court to represent herself and her son in lieu of hiring an attorney. In a filing on Aug. 9, Wells helpfully included the letter in the screenshot above, and volunteered that her son had been questioned by U.K. authorities in connection with the bitcoin theft.</p>
<p>Neither of the defendants&#8217; families are disputing the basic claim that their kids stole from Mr. Schober. Rather, they&#8217;re asserting that time has run out on Schober&#8217;s legal ability to claim a cause of action against them. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/man-robbed-of-16-bitcoin-sues-young-thieves-parents/#more-56713" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Criminal hackers will try almost anything to get inside a profitable enterprise and secure a million-dollar payday from a ransomware infection. Apparently now that includes emailing employees directly and asking them to unleash the malware inside their employer&#8217;s network in exchange for a percentage of any ransom amount paid by the victim company.</p>
<div id="attachment_56671" style="width: 668px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56671" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-56671" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/madalin.png" alt="" width="658" height="263" /><p id="caption-attachment-56671" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Abnormal Security.</p></div>
<p><strong>Crane Hassold</strong>, director of threat intelligence at <strong>Abnormal Security</strong>, <a href="https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/nigerian-ransomware-soliciting-employees-demonware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">described</a> what happened after he adopted a fake persona and responded to the proposal in the screenshot above. It offered to pay him 40 percent of a million-dollar ransom demand if he agreed to launch their malware inside his employer&#8217;s network.</p>
<p>This particular scammer was fairly chatty, and over the course of five days it emerged that Hassold&#8217;s correspondent was forced to change up his initial approach in planning to deploy the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/ransomware-operators-are-piling-on-already-hacked-exchange-servers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DemonWare ransomware strain</a>, which is freely available on <strong>GitHub</strong>. </p>
<p>&#8220;According to this actor, he had originally intended to send his targets—all senior-level executives—phishing emails to compromise their accounts, but after that was unsuccessful, he pivoted to this ransomware pretext,&#8221; Hassold wrote.</p>
<p>Abnormal Security documented how it tied the email back to a young man in Nigeria who acknowledged he was trying to save up money to help fund a new social network he is building called <strong>Sociogram</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_56674" style="width: 641px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56674" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sociogram.png" alt="" width="631" height="379" class="size-full wp-image-56674" /><p id="caption-attachment-56674" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Abnormal Security.</p></div>
<p>Reached via LinkedIn, Sociogram founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwameda/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oluwaseun Medayedupin</a> asked to have his startup&#8217;s name removed from the story, although he did not respond to questions about whether there were any inaccuracies in Hassold&#8217;s report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t harm Sociogram&#8217;s reputation,&#8221; Medayedupin pleaded. &#8220;I beg you as a promising young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>This attacker&#8217;s approach may seem fairly amateur, but it would be a mistake to dismiss the threat from West African cybercriminals dabbling in ransomware. While multi-million dollar ransomware payments are hogging the headlines, by far the biggest financial losses tied to cybercrime each year stem from so-called <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/business-email-compromise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Business Email Compromise (BEC) or CEO Scams</a>, in which crooks mainly based in Africa and Southeast Asia will spoof communications from executives at the target firm in a bid to initiate unauthorized international wire transfers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest figures</a> (PDF) released by the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> (IC3), the reported losses from BEC scams continue to dwarf other cybercrime loss categories, increasing to $1.86 billion in 2020.</p>
<div id="attachment_56673" style="width: 707px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56673" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fbi2020crimesbyloss.png" alt="" width="697" height="466" class="size-full wp-image-56673" /><p id="caption-attachment-56673" class="wp-caption-text">Image: FBI</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Knowing the actor is Nigerian really brings the entire story full circle and provides some notable context to the tactics used in the initial email we identified,&#8221; Hassold wrote. &#8220;For decades, West African scammers, primarily located in Nigeria, have perfected the use of social engineering in cybercrime activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While the most common cyber attack we see from Nigerian actors (and most damaging attack globally) is business email compromise (BEC), it makes sense that a Nigerian actor would fall back on using similar social engineering techniques, even when attempting to successfully deploy a more technically sophisticated attack like ransomware,&#8221; Hassold concluded.</p>
<h2>DON&#8217;T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB</h2>
<p>Cybercriminals trolling for disgruntled employees is hardly a new development. Big companies have long been worried about the very real threat of disgruntled employees creating identities on darknet sites and then offering to trash their employer&#8217;s network for a fee (for more on that, see my 2016 story, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/06/rise-of-darknet-stokes-fear-of-the-insider/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rise of the Darknet Stokes Fear of the Insider</a>). <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/wanted-disgruntled-employees-to-deploy-ransomware/#more-56667" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

<p><strong>T-Mobile</strong> is warning that a data breach has exposed the names, date of birth, Social Security number and driver&#8217;s license/ID information of more than 40 million current, former or prospective customers who applied for credit with the company. The acknowledgment came less than 48 hours after millions of the stolen T-Mobile customer records went up for sale in the cybercrime underground.</p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday evening, T-Mobile said a &#8220;highly sophisticated&#8221; attack against its network led to the breach of data on millions of customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our preliminary analysis is that approximately 7.8 million current T-Mobile postpaid customer accounts’ information appears to be contained in the stolen files, as well as just over 40 million records of former or prospective customers who had previously applied for credit with T-Mobile,&#8221; the company wrote in <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/additional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>. &#8220;Importantly, no phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords, or financial information were compromised in any of these files of customers or prospective customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, T-Mobile is urging all T-Mobile postpaid customers to proactively change their account PINs by going online into their T-Mobile account or calling customer care at 611. &#8220;This precaution is despite the fact that we have no knowledge that any postpaid account PINs were compromised,&#8221; the advisory reads.</p>
<p>It is not clear how many people total may be impacted by this breach. T-Mobile hasn&#8217;t yet responded to requests for clarification regarding how many of the 7.8 million current customers may also have been affected by the credit application breach. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-breach-exposed-ssn-dob-of-40m-people/#more-56638" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>Communications giant <strong>T-Mobile</strong> said today it is investigating the extent of a breach that hackers claim has exposed sensitive personal data on 100 million T-Mobile USA customers, in many cases including the name, Social Security number, address, date of birth, phone number, security PINs and details that uniquely identify each customer&#8217;s mobile device.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Vice.com <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke the news</a> that someone was selling data on 100 million people, and that the data came from T-Mobile. In <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/cybersecurity-incident-update-august-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> published on its website today, the company confirmed it had suffered an intrusion involving &#8220;some T-Mobile data,&#8221; but said it was too soon in its investigation to know what was stolen and how many customers might be affected.</p>
<div id="attachment_56617" style="width: 763px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56617" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-56617" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tmob.png" alt="" width="753" height="722" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tmob.png 855w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tmob-768x737.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tmob-782x750.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56617" class="wp-caption-text">A sales thread tied to the allegedly stolen T-Mobile customer data.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;We have determined that unauthorized access to some T-Mobile data occurred, however we have not yet determined that there is any personal customer data involved,&#8221; T-Mobile wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed,&#8221; the statement continued. &#8220;This investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others.&#8221;</p>
<p>The intrusion came to light on Twitter when the account <a href="https://twitter.com/und0xxed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@und0xxed</a> started tweeting the details. Reached via direct message, Und0xxed said they were not involved in stealing the databases but was instead in charge of finding buyers for the stolen T-Mobile customer data.</p>
<p>Und0xxed said the hackers found an opening in T-Mobile&#8217;s wireless data network that allowed access to two of T-Mobile&#8217;s customer data centers. From there, the intruders were able to dump a number of customer databases totaling more than 100 gigabytes.</p>
<p>They claim one of those databases holds the name, date of birth, SSN, drivers license information, plaintext security PIN, address and phone number of 36 million T-Mobile customers in the United States &#8212; all going back to the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>The hacker(s) claim the purloined data also includes <a href="https://www.guidingtech.com/imei-vs-imsi-number/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IMSI and IMEI data</a> for 36 million customers. These are unique numbers embedded in customer mobile devices that identify the device and the SIM card that ties that customer&#8217;s device to a telephone number.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to verify that I have access to the data/the data is real, just give me a T-Mobile number and I&#8217;ll run a lookup for you and return the IMEI and IMSI of the phone currently attached to the number and any other details,&#8221; @und0xxed said. &#8220;All T-Mobile USA prepaid and postpaid customers are affected; Sprint and the other telecoms that T-Mobile owns are unaffected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other databases allegedly accessed by the intruders included one for prepaid accounts, which had far fewer details about customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prepaid customers usually are just phone number and IMEI and IMSI,&#8221; Und0xxed said. &#8220;Also, the collection of databases includes historical entries, and many phone numbers have 10 or 20 IMEIs attached to them over the years, and the service dates are provided. There&#8217;s also a database that includes credit card numbers with six digits of the cards obfuscated.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/#more-56613" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p>A new dark web service is marketing to cybercriminals who are curious to see how their various cryptocurrency holdings and transactions may be linked to known criminal activity. Dubbed &#8220;<strong>Antinalysis,&#8221; </strong>the service purports to offer a glimpse into how one&#8217;s payment activity might be flagged by law enforcement agencies and private companies that try to link suspicious cryptocurrency transactions to real people.</p>
<div id="attachment_56584" style="width: 771px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ant-result.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56584" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-56584" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ant-result.png" alt="" width="761" height="623" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ant-result.png 971w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ant-result-768x629.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ant-result-782x640.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-56584" class="wp-caption-text">Sample provided by Antinalysis.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Worried about dirty funds in your BTC address? Come check out Antinalysis, the new address risk analyzer,&#8221; reads the service&#8217;s announcement, pointing to a link only accessible via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tor</a>. &#8220;This service is dedicated to individuals that have the need to possess complete privacy on the blockchain, offering a perspective from the opponent&#8217;s point of view in order for the user to comprehend the possibility of his/her funds getting flagged down under autocratic illegal charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ad continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some people might ask, why go into all that? Just cash out in XMR and be done with it. The problem is, cashing out in Monero raises eyebrows on exchanges and mail by cash method is sometimes risky as well. If you use BTC-&gt;XMR-&gt;BTC method, you&#8217;ll still get flagged down by our services labelled as high risk exchange (not to mention LE and exchanges). Our service provides you with a view from LE/exchange&#8217;s perspective of things (with similar accuracy, but quite different approach) that provides you with basic knowledge of how &#8220;clean&#8221; your address is.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tom Robinson</strong>, co-founder of blockchain intelligence firm <a href="https://www.eliptic.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elliptic</a>, said Antinalysis is designed to help crypto money launderers test whether their funds will be identified as proceeds of crime by regulated financial exchanges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cryptoassets have become an important tool for cybercriminals,&#8221; Robinson <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/cybercriminals-have-built-their-own-blockchain-analytics-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. &#8220;The likes of ransomware and darknet markets rely on payments being made in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, laundering and cashing-out these proceeds is a major challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges make use of blockchain analytics tools, he said, to check customer deposits for links to illicit activity. By tracing a transaction back through the blockchain, these tools can identify whether the funds originated from a wallet associated with ransomware or any other criminal activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The launderer therefore risks being identified as a criminal and being reported to law enforcement whenever they send funds to a business using such a tool,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;Antinalysis seeks to help crypto launderers to avoid this, by giving them a preview of what a blockchain analytics tool will make of their bitcoin wallet and the funds it contains.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-56585" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/antinalysis.png" alt="" width="274" height="247" /></p>
<p>Each lookup at Antinalysis costs roughly USD $3, with a minimum $30 purchase. Other plans go as high as $6,000 for 5,000 requests.</p>
<p>Robinson says the creator of Antinalysis is also one of the developers of <strong>Incognito Market</strong>, a darknet marketplace specializing in the sale of narcotics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incognito was launched in late 2020, and accepts payments in both Bitcoin and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero</a>, a cryptoasset offering heightened anonymity,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The launch of Antinalysis likely reflects the difficulties faced by the market and its vendors in cashing out their Bitcoin proceeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elliptic wasn&#8217;t impressed with the quality of the intelligence provided by Antinalysis, saying it performs poorly on detecting links to major darknet markets and other criminal entities. But with countless criminals now making millions from ransomware, there is certainly a vast, untapped market for services that help those folks improve their operational security.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is also significant because it makes blockchain analytics available to the public for the first time,&#8221; Robinson wrote. &#8220;To date, this type of analysis has been used primarily by regulated financial service providers.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/new-anti-anti-money-laundering-services-for-crooks/#more-56578" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released software updates to plug at least 44 security vulnerabilities in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and related products. The software giant warned that attackers already are pouncing on one of the flaws, which ironically enough involves an easy-to-exploit bug in the software component responsible for patching <strong>Windows 10</strong> PCs and <strong>Windows Server 2019</strong> machines.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-52647" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png" alt="" width="757" height="556" /></p>
<p>Microsoft said attackers have seized upon <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-36948</a>, which is a weakness in the <strong>Windows Update Medic</strong> service. Update Medic is a new service that lets users repair Windows Update components from a damaged state so that the device can continue to receive updates.</p>
<p>Redmond says while CVE-2021-36948 is being actively exploited, it is not aware of exploit code publicly available. The flaw is an &#8220;elevation of privilege&#8221; vulnerability that affects Windows 10 and <strong>Windows Server 2019</strong>, meaning it can be leveraged in combination with another vulnerability to let attackers run code of their choice as administrator on a vulnerable system.</p>
<p>&#8220;CVE-2021-36948 is a privilege escalation vulnerability &#8211; the cornerstone of modern intrusions as they allow attackers the level of access to do things like hide their tracks and create user accounts,&#8221; said <strong>Kevin Breen</strong> of <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immersive Labs</a>. &#8220;In the case of ransomware attacks, they have also been used to ensure maximum damage.&#8221; <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2021-edition/#more-56563" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
