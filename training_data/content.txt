Executive Summary
In September, 2015, CGS, the prime contractor on behalf of Alliance Defending Freedom, engaged Coalfire Systems, Inc.,
the sub-contractor (hereinafter “Coalfire”) to conduct a computer forensics analysis of certain raw video and audio data
files. Coalfire’s objectives for this project are to:
-

Forensically evaluate video and audio files provided by The Center for Medical Progress (“the Organization”)
through CGS (“raw” video and audio), and determine whether the raw video or audio content of the files have
been edited or otherwise altered;

-

Compare the raw video and audio to certain files posted to YouTube (“Full Footage” videos and a
“Supplemental” video) for the purpose of determining inconsistencies between the files.

The scope of Coalfire’s analysis did not cover or include:
-

Validation of those individuals depicted in the video or audio, who recorded the video and audio files, the
location where they were recorded, when they were recorded, or the purpose of the recordings;

-

Providing an opinion on the chain of custody prior to receipt of source materials by Coalfire;

-

Coalfire’s analysis was limited to only the source materials received from the Organization and did not include
interviews of participants in the videos or audio.

A flash drive containing recorded media was received via FedEx by Coalfire on September 17th, 2015, where it was
examined using industry-standard forensic tools and techniques. The flash drive contained (i) a total of ten (10) videos
with audio recorded on two (2) separate devices, and (ii) a total of eight (8) audio recordings made with two (2) audioonly devices.
Coalfire’s analysis of the recorded media files contained on the flash drive indicates that the video recordings are
authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or editing. This conclusion is supported by the consistency of the video
file date and time stamps, the video timecode, as well as the folder and file naming scheme. The uniformity between the
footage from the cameras from the two Investigators also support the evidence that the video recordings are authentic.
With regard to the “Full Footage” YouTube videos released by the Organization, edits made to these videos were applied
to eliminate non-pertinent footage, including “commuting,” “waiting,” “adjusting recording equipment,” “meals,” or
“restroom breaks,” lacking pertinent conversation. Any discrepancies in the chronology of the timecodes are consistent
with the intentional removal of this non-pertinent footage as described in this report.
Furthermore, four of the five raw video recordings, which also contained audio captured from the video recording
device, are accompanied by a raw audio recording captured from a separate audio-only recording device. The raw audioonly recordings last for the duration of their associated raw videos. These raw audio recordings support the
completeness and authenticity of the raw video recordings since they depict the same events within the same duration
as captured from the two separate video recorders.

Evidence Acquisition Processing Procedures
Coalfire employed industry standard tools and techniques throughout handling, processing, and analysis of the
evidence. A sealed FedEx Express envelope was received into Coalfire Labs via FedEx Overnight delivery on September
17, 2015 at 8:35 AM (MST). A Chain of Custody was established upon opening the package. The package contained one
USB flash drive sealed in a FedEx label pouch. Details about the enclosed media are included below.

Coalfire used a Logicube Falcon to create a raw DD image of the evidence onto a previously wiped hard drive. The
images were verified by their hash values. A working copy of the original image was created onto a previously wiped
hard drive. All subsequent analysis was performed on the working copy forensic image, not on the original media or the
original forensic image acquisition. The analysis was performed on a dedicated forensic workstation using AccessData’s
Forensic Toolkit (FTK) version 5.6.3.16, VLC Player version 2.2.1, Apple QuickTime version 7.7.8, and iZotope RX
Advanced.

Analysis
File and Folder Analysis
There were a total of 29 folders residing on the flash drive. Each of the folders shows a modified, accessed, and created
date of 2015-09-13 UTC with the modified and created time stamps between 2015-09-13 03:36:03 UTC and 2015-09-13
04:57:35 UTC. Copying a folder from a source drive to a destination drive results in the creation of a new modified and
created date and time stamp on the destination drive. The date and time stamp from the source drive directory does not
carry over to the directory created on the destination drive. This suggests that the date and time stamps for the folders
located on the flash drive are indicative of when the folders were copied from the original source drive to the flash drive.
The root consisted of 5 directories which are listed below with their creation time and date stamps.

Directories contained within the root of the flash drive
Within these directories were two subdirectories, each with the name of a male and a female. The male name will
hereinafter be referred to as “Investigator 1” and the female name as “Investigator 2.” Within each of these folders
were either a subdirectory named “MyRecord” or a folder named with a numeric date. Where there was a “MyRecord”
folder present, the “MyRecord” folder contained a subdirectory named by numeric date. The folders named by numeric
dates contained recorded video files corresponding to the numeric date of the folder. The five directories in the root
listed above delineate five separate dates of video recordings which is explained in further detail below.
The folders named with numeric dates contained video files. In total, there were 86 AVI video files on the flash drive.
The metadata for the AVI video files does not contain any metadata or unique file signatures to indicate the video
recording device that was used to create the video. Review of the video content reveals that the video files were
captured from two separate video recording devices which are separated into the Investigator 1 and Investigator 2

directories. The numeric dates within the video file names are consistent throughout all other folder names in the path
to any given video file. Examples of the folder and file naming schemes are shown below.


[root]\072514DebNucatola\[Investigator 1]\MyRecord\20140725\FNND0569_20140725114841.AVI

The example above shows a folder naming structure containing the “MyRecord” subdirectory. In the example above, the
root directory name contains a numeric date of 7/25/2014, a subdirectory with a name containing the numeric date
7/25/2014, and containing a video file with a file name including the numeric date 7/25/2014. Another example of the
folder and file naming structure is shown below.


[root]\PPGC040915\[Investigator 2]\20150409\FNNI0773_20150409071900.AVI

In the example above, the root directory name contains the numeric date 4/9/2015, a subdirectory with a name
containing the numeric date 4/9/2015, and containing a video file with a file name including the numeric date 4/9/2015.
Contrary to folders, the last modified and created date and time stamps of a file is preserved when the parent folder it
resides in is copied from a source drive to a destination drive. Therefore, the last modified date and time stamps of the
video files contained on the flash drive were preserved from the original source files. The video files residing on the flash
drive show last modified and created time stamps between 2015-02-06 20:47:28 UTC to 2014-07-25 22:18:26 UTC.
Review of the video file modified date stamps shows that they are consistent with the numeric dates reflected in the
video file names as well as the folders in the path of those video files. Furthermore, the date stamps embedded within
the videos themselves are consistent with the date stamps of the folders in the video file path.
An example of the relationship between the video file name and file created date stamp is shown below.

The AVI file names also contain a number representing the timecode that is embedded in the first frame of that video
file. An example of this is shown below.


[root]\PPGC040915\[Investigator 1]\FNND0569_20150409081515.AVI

In this example (on the following page), the video file named FNND0569_20150409081515.AVI shows a date of
4/9/2015 and a first frame timecode of 08:15:15. Below is a screenshot of the first frame (frame 000000) of the
20150409081515.AVI video.

There were some videos, however, where the first frame does show a timecode that is one second behind the time
shown in the video file name.
All of the AVI video files are 1011 MB in size or smaller. When the modified time stamps are in chronological order, it is
evident that a new video file is created once the preceding video file size reaches 1011 MB during continuous recording.
This is demonstrated by noting the final timecode embedded in the last frame of the video and comparing it to the
timecode in the first frame of the next video in sequence (the first frame timecode number is also contained in the video
file name). It is a common feature of video recording devices to capture continuous recording in numerous smaller
separate files to avoid issues with file systems that cannot accommodate large file sizes and to minimize data loss in the
case of file corruption as result of hardware failure (dead battery, malfunction, etc.). Review of the AVI files that were
smaller than 1011 MB appears to be the result of a manual stop performed on the recording device by the camera
operator.

Continuous video recording segments
Based on this evidence presented in this section, Coalfire concludes that the video files located on the flash drive are
accurate representations of the raw unedited footage captured by the original video camera with reliable and consistent
timecodes.

Video Content Analysis and Comparison
The video recordings created by both Investigator 1 and Investigator 2 depict many of the same scenes from two
different perspectives as captured by their individual cameras. The timecodes embedded in the video recordings are not
synced to each other. Coalfire determined the approximate offsets of the two video cameras for each day of recording.

Video Camera Timecode Offset

By establishing the offset in timecode, Coalfire was able to compare events from each of the cameras as they happened
in real time. This was critical when comparing the raw footage videos contained on the flash drive to the Full Footage
videos released by the Center for Medical Progress on YouTube. The Full Footage CMP YouTube videos are listed below
and uploaded by the YouTube user “The Center for Medical Progress”.

Coalfire reviewed any and all inconsistencies in timecode apparent in the Full Footage videos for comparison to the raw
video footage corresponding to those videos. Notes were made upon review of the raw video content which described
the events that took place during the missing footage that was edited from the Full Footage videos. Events that were left
out of the Full Footage videos lacked pertinent conversation. The events depicted in the missing footage fell into five
common categories: commuting, waiting, adjusting recording equipment, meals, and restroom breaks. “Commuting”
footage consists of Investigator 1 and 2 driving in car to locations, or walking outside to locations outside or inside a
building. “Waiting” footage consists of Investigator 1 and 2 waiting to engage with primary Planned Parenthood subject,
or other personnel, usually in a lobby, office, or a restaurant table. “Adjusting recording equipment” footage consists of
times when Investigator 1 and 2 are manually setting camera or audio recording device equipment, adjusting the
equipment, or changing the batteries. “Meal” footage consists of Investigator 1 and 2 eating. “Restroom break” footage
consists of Investigator 1 or 2 going to the restroom primarily to relieve themselves.

The 07:46:47 stop coincides with the end of the raw video file named FNND0569_20150409071822.AVI. The next file in
the sequence (FNND0569_20150409074648.AVI) starts at 07:46:48 (frame 000000) and ends at 08:15:09 (frame
051046). The next video file in sequence (FNND0569_20150409081515.AVI) starts at 08:15:15 (frame 000000). The
missing footage between in the Full Footage YouTube video between 7:46:47 and 8:15:15 matches the time duration of
the raw video file FNND0569_20150409074648.AVI.
Coalfire reviewed the content of the Supplemental Full Footage video against the raw video and audio and determined
that the supplemental video matches the timeframe, timecodes, and events depicted in the raw video file

In the Full Footage video, the video recording starts from Investigator 1. When Investigator 1 excuses himself for the
restroom, Investigator 2’s camera is used to follow the conversation at the table. The -00:04:03 offset from Investigator
2’s camera to Investigator 1’s camera explains the jump in time.
The raw video shows that Investigator 1’s camera shows the date stamp 2014.07.25 while Investigator 2’s camera shows
the date stamp 2013.07.25.

Since the raw video recordings both depict the same events in real time, the discrepancy in the date stamp year is
attributed to the two camera’s date and time settings not being synced to each other.

Audio Content Analysis
With the exception of the “052215Dyer dinner” directory, each day of video recording was accompanied by MP3 audio
recordings within the Investigator 1 and Investigator 2 folders. This resulted in audio recordings from the point of view
of both Investigator 1 and Investigator 2 that are separate from the audio captured by the video recording device. Like
the video recordings, the audio files contained a numeric date in the file name. An example of one of the audio
recording file paths is shown below.

This MP3 audio recording exhibits a file name containing the date 2/6/2015 which is consistent with the numeric dates
in the names of the other folders and files contained in the top level parent directory. The creation date of this file is
also consistent with the date contained in the names of the files and folders contained within the top parent directory.
The metadata embedded in the header of the hexadecimal data reveals that this audio recording was captured with a
Sony IC Recorder model ICD-UX-533. The metadata also reflects the date the recording was created which is consistent
with the file date stamp.

MP3 Audio Recording Files
Much like the footage from the two separate cameras, Coalfire was able to time align the audio recordings to the video
footage to allow for review of any inconsistencies or anomalies in their content with both the video and audio
recordings from the two video cameras.

Using widely-accepted digital forensic techniques and procedures, digital forensic
personnel from Stroz Friedberg made bit-for-bit, verified forensic copies or images of:
the hard drive within the Compaq Presario desktop computer; the hard drive within the
eMachines desktop computer; the hard drive within the Toshiba Satellite laptop
computer; the Maxtor external hard drive; the Seagate Hard Drive; and 173 of the 174
floppy disks.
The digital forensic copying process captured the entire contents of each piece of
media, including the active user-accessible files, the deleted files, and the unallocated
space, which may contain deleted content. Because the forensic image created by
Plaintiff’s Expert is a forensic image file, Stroz Friedberg used a forensically-sound copy
method to copy the forensic image file on that drive to preservation media.

Investigation Steps
Stroz Friedberg conducted its analysis of the Ceglia media pursuant to the Protocol
issued by the Court. Stroz Friedberg searched and analyzed the Ceglia Media “to
identify only documents, data, fragments, and artifacts that reasonably appear[ed] to
be related to the authenticity of the [Work for Hire Document] attached to the
Amended Complaint and the [P]urported [E]mails described in the Amended
Complaint.”. The documents, data, fragments, and artifacts found by Stroz Friedberg
that reasonably appeared to be related to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails first were produced to Mr. Ceglia’s attorneys for a
privilege review. The material was turned over to attorneys from Gibson Dunn only if
no privilege objection was raised, an asserted privilege objection was withdrawn by Mr.
Ceglia or his attorneys, or an assertion of privilege was overruled by the Court. Stroz
Friedberg has followed the terms of the Protocol for all data found on the Ceglia
Media and any other data subject to the Protocol during its analysis, including the
procedures for privilege review and production set forth above and the maintenance of
a search log.

https://www.cybersleuthlab.org

During this analysis, Stroz Friedberg employed a methodology tailored to the particular
facts of this case. Stroz Friedberg’s methodology included: (1) conducting keyword and
other searches of the digital forensic copies of the Ceglia Media and other data,
including webmail accounts, to identify responsive documents or fragments of
documents; (2) manually reviewing the documents containing keyword hits, certain
unsearchable file types, such as image files with no text, and other documents to
determine whether they were relevant to the authenticity of the Work for Hire
Document or the Purported Emails; and (3) reviewing the digital forensic copies of the
Ceglia Media for digital forensic artifacts relevant to the authenticity of the Work for
Hire Document or the Purported Emails.

Findings
No exact copies of the Work for Hire Document were found on the Ceglia Media,
which comprised hundreds of pieces of media - including computers, hard drives and
floppy disks. Stroz Friedberg used a methodology that would have identified any
copies of the Work for Hire Document on the Ceglia Media if they had been present.
Instead of the purported Work for Hire Document, Stroz Friedberg found on the Ceglia
Media seven unsigned versions of the Work for Hire Document that are very similar but
not identical to the purported Work for Hire Document. All seven of those electronic
documents contain metadata anomalies indicative of backdating and document
manipulation.
Mr. Ceglia’s Amended Complaint purports to quote from or otherwise reference 22
Purported Emails between Mr. Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg. During the litigation, Mr.
Ceglia acknowledged that he did not keep the Purported Emails referenced in the
Amended Complaint in their original native form, that is to say, as individual files in
message format. Rather, he claimed to have copied-and-pasted the text of the
Purported Emails into Microsoft Word documents saved to floppy disks in order to
maintain copies of these messages.

1.504.608.5766

info@ cybersleuthlab.org

https://www.cybersleuthlab.org

Stroz Friedberg found substantial evidence that all three of the Word documents
containing the purported emails are backdated. The effect of backdating is to obscure
the true date and time at which computer activity, such as the creation or modification
of documents, occurred. Backdating can be accomplished by setting the system clock
on a computer hard drive to an earlier date, such that activity that occurs on the hard
drive while the computer is in a backdated state will appear to have occurred at that
earlier time.
Moreover, the last printed date of the document is February 15, 2011, while the
document’s last modified date is April 25, 2003. As discussed above, absent
backdating or manipulation of the system clock, it is not possible for a file’s last printed
date to post-date its last modification date. Therefore, this document was fabricated on
or after February 15, 2011. This date is years after the Work for Hire Document was
allegedly signed and months after Mr. Ceglia filed this lawsuit.

Conclusion
Stroz Friedberg found direct and compelling digital forensic evidence that the
documents relied upon by Mr. Ceglia to support his claim are forged. Stroz Friedberg
also found what it believes to be the authentic contract between Mr. Ceglia and Mr.
Zuckerberg. That contract contains no references to Facebook. As described more fully
in this report, Stroz Friedberg made the following findings bearing on the authenticity
of the Work for Hire Document and the Purported Emails:
Stroz Friedberg did not find any exact copies of the Work for Hire Document on the
hundreds of pieces of media produced by Mr. Ceglia, including three computers, three
hard drives, 174 floppy disks, and 1,087 CDs (hereinafter, the “Ceglia Media”).
Stroz Friedberg did find a signed copy of an April 28, 2003 contract between Mr.
Ceglia and Mr. Zuckerberg, though it concerns only Mr. Zuckerberg’s work on the
StreetFax project and includes no references to Facebook.

1.504.608.5766

info@ cybersleuthlab.org

https://www.cybersleuthlab.org

Stroz Friedberg identified seven unsigned electronic documents on the Ceglia Media
that are variants of the Work for Hire Document. All of these electronic documents
were backdated to appear as if they were created at earlier dates. They appear to be
part of an effort to create a fraudulent contract.
Stroz Friedberg did identify the Microsoft Word documents into which Mr. Ceglia
claims to have copied-and-pasted the text of the Purported Emails. All of these Word
documents were backdated to appear as if they were created at earlier dates.
The Purported Emails themselves, which Mr. Ceglia has proffered as authentic
communications with Mr. Zuckerberg, are fabricated. Many of the Purported Emails
reflect the wrong time zone. For example, all of the Purported Emails purportedly sent
from October 26, 2003 to April 4, 2004 contain the “-0400” time zone stamp that
reflects Eastern Daylight Time. However, Eastern Daylight Time was not in effect during
this time. There is no place in the Continental United States from which Mr. Ceglia
could have sent these Purported Emails with an accurate “-0400” time zone stamp.
The Purported Emails have formatting differences in the email headers that are
inconsistent with Mr. Ceglia’s explanation that he copied-and-pasted the emails into
Word documents. These formatting differences indicate that the Purported Emails were
typed or edited manually and were not solely the result of a copy-and-paste operation.
There is no digital forensic evidence on the Ceglia Media supporting a conclusion that
the Work for Hire Document or the Purported Emails are authentic documents dating
from 2003 and 2004. To the contrary, the digital forensic evidence strongly indicates
that these documents were fabricated by Mr. Ceglia at a later date.

HASH OF ORIGINAL EVIDENCE



The original media was connected to a forensic hardware write blocker (asset tag #) and the write blocker connected to a forensic computer (asset tag #).  Prior to doing anything with the original media, the media was hashed to obtain a baseline hash value.  This allows the hash value of the original media to later be compared to the hash value of the forensic image created of the original media.  By comparing the hash values of the original media and that of the forensic image, the forensic image can be authenticated as an exact duplicate copy of the original evidence.



The hash values obtained from the original evidence were as follows:





  MD5: 	       

  SHA1: 	     

  Other: 	     





FORENSIC IMAGING



After obtaining the hash value(s) of the original media, a forensic image was created.  The forensic image was placed on a:





  Government owned, forensically wiped hard drive

  Government owned, forensically wiped Storage Area Network (SAN)





The forensic imaging software utilized in this process creates an imaging report, detailing the hash value(s) of the newly created forensic image.  The hash value(s) of the forensic image was compared to the original hash value obtained prior to imaging the device.  The hash value(s) of the forensic image:





  Matched exactly the hash value(s) of the original media.

  Did not match the original hash value(s) of the media.  If checked, provide explanation below.







VIRUS AND MALWARE



The original media was scanned for malware.  Prior to the scan, all malware definitions were updated.  The results were:





  No malware detected.

  Malware detected.  If checked, identify and report on malware located below.

Abstract
This document is submitted as the practical part of the GCIA Certified Forensic
Analyst program (GCFA)1.

fu
ll r

igh
ts.

This practical is in two parts, the first of which required an image of a floppy disk to
be analysed and a report submitted based upon the contents. During this part of
the practical, the investigator discovered traces of a steganographic program
(Camouflage.exe). The conclusion being that the owner and holder of the disk had
attempted to export company data via this hidden means.

rr

eta

ins

The second part of the practical required the analysis of a system that had been
compromised. Due to difficulties obtaining such a system, approval was given for
the author to analyse an abandoned pc bought from a refuse disposal facility (thus
the investigator had no knowledge as to the contents of the drive, its purpose or the
intent of the user).

During the second phase of this practical the contents of the abandoned system’s
hard drive was examined to glean the user’s role, their style and skill in operating
the system. An examination of the drive for illegal or inappropriate data/content was
conducted and a comment made as to the possible breaches of UK or International
laws. Finally, the drive’s owner is identified from the contents of the hard disk, and
their recent activities and actions traced.

The conclusion draws the problems and complexities of the whole process together
and identifies how a lack of user knowledge resulted in a system being brought to
its knees with Spyware before, in an effort to protect it, the user rendered it
inoperable by the installed of defensive software.

Report on the Forensic Analysis of a recovered Floppy Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On 27 April 2004, the forensic investigator was tasked by Mr Keen to conduct an
analysis of a floppy disk recovered from a Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was
employed by Ballard Industries, as the lead process control engineer for the project
to design a new fuel cell battery.

fu
ll r

The floppy disk was recovered by a security guard who seized it from the above RJ
Leszczynski at 1645 on 24 April 2004. The disk had been in Leszczynski’s
briefcase, but this was in breach of the Company Security Policy and therefore the
guard impounded the disk, forwarding it to Mr Keen to Security Administrator.

eta

ins

The Security Administrator was mindful for the ongoing investigation into customer
drift and information leakage and request a full analysis of the disks contents.

The only item of evidence submitted or analysis was a single Floppy Disk. The disk
received was identified and described as:

The forensic workstation image was re-ghosted to the laptop and all respective
security and reliability patches applied. The workstation used was a Dell [Dell]
Inspiron 5100 with removable hard disk caddies containing:

All products were updated remotely via removable media and therefore, had never
been connected to the internet; thus they can be judged to be forensically and
operationally sound in that they will represent accurately all data they process and
display. The image of the laptop has been retained for future use and reference
should it be required.
Autopsy (v1.70) and The Sleuth Kit were then loaded to perform various analyses on

(TSK), the newer version (v2.03) of Autopsy could not be loaded onto the Forensics
System (lib failure with Fedora Core 2 (FC2)). TSK is a collection of command line
tools that have been adapted and modified from their original release in the form of
‘The Coroner’s Toolkit7 (TCT). Autopsy is a graphical front end to TSK that uses perl
to interprets the user’s actions and builds the TSK commands in the background.
The user interface is via a standard web browser but output is graphical with logs,
recovered files, md5 hashes, timeline output etc being stored in a user definable

the form of test files that are stored in a folder designated by the initial investigator.
These test files are created and md5 hashes performed on each as they are written
to the HDD. The md5 hash is stored with the output and then the output is
displayed for the investigator. All output listed in this report will be using the text
saved by Autopsy (unless otherwise stated). Screen shots included will be of the

all joints signed by the investigator and the Security Administrator, with all signed

a humidity controlled safe. The investigator has had no access to the disk,

AntiVirus Scan of the disk image

The disk was subject to an AntiVirus Scan using Norton AV, which was updated
moments before the scan being run. It was therefore considered that the image did
not contain any viruses known at the time of the scan (that were detectable).

The Initial Analysis

igh

The disk image was made read only in the Linux OS [chmod 444 v1_5.gz] and
thus any activity and investigation conducted by the investigator could not have
affected the disk image. As a precaution once the investigation was complete a
final md5 hash was conducted and it confirmed that the image had not been altered
during the analysis.

Creating a File Activity Timeline

igh
ts.

Next a file timeline was created from all Allocated and Unallocated space on the
drive including the Unallocated Meta Data structures. This would show the order in
which files were created, modified and deleted. The file was created by Autopsy
and as the ‘output/body’ file was created an md5 hash of the file was also written to
the working folder (/forensics/floppy/FloppyDisk/). The final step for this
item was to create the time-line file from the body with a start and end point. As
Floppy disk contained small amounts of data a complete timeline was requested
and this was saved as ‘output/total-timeline’.

The timeline would be later analysed and referred to as a key reference document,
indicating file activity and user actions. As the timeline related to a floppy disk the
activity recorded would primarily be that of the user as systems are rarely able to
page or record system activity to the media (limited volume size, slow read and
write speed coupled with a lack of system pre-notification as to its removal)

Creating a String File
A ‘String File’ is the output of a search of any string of 4 or more characters in row.
In other words it is a file of all the groups of characters that may be words. This
Strings File can then be examined to gain insight into the contents of the originally
searched file or disk structure. This file can be searched using the likes of grep or
any text string search utility (even find in notepad).

While the accuracy of the documents in relation to the current company policies is
not something that the investigator would comment upon, the first 2 files listed
above were deemed larger that expected given their limited textual content. These
files were recorded as being ‘of interest’ and would be subjected to closer
examination later.
An examination was then made of the files that had been marked as deleted, this
included a CamShell.dll (probably a part of a program) and _ndex.htm
(probably an ‘Index.htm’ page from a website). The time-line shows a file was
deleted on 3rd Feb 2001 and that file was the CamShell.dll. A search of the
internet revealed a handful of newsgroups that referred to an old and now
unsupported program called Camouflage. Further searches led the investigator to
this web site located at the URL: <http://camouflage.unfiction.com>9 (pictured

This did present a problem as to this point no passwords had been recovered, either
in text files on in the form of an obvious file or text in a file on the disk.

Passwords
The investigator then tried a few default passwords, starting with “password” which
was rejected. The next one tried was “Password” this was the correct password as

after trying several dozen passwords gold was struck. It closer examination
indicated that the password for the Password_Policy.doc file was the first part of

File Timings Explained
Before explaining what the investigator believes occurred, it is worth explaining the
somewhat unusual timings that are often connected to files that have been copied
to new media (as happened in this case).
Operating Systems. Operating Systems that are POSIX and E2 complaint
record time stamps on files when they are Modified, Accessed or Created
(called MAC times). Some like many UNIX flavours (inc Linux) apply stamps
time stamps on all activity (unless prohibited by the tool accessing the file).
Microsoft Windows however, will stamp full time and date information on
16 of 57

Author retains full rights

creation and modification but only date information on file access
occurrences (the access time being stored else where).
File copying. File copying can create some strange timings as only the files
creation time and date are updated. Therefore, it is possible to make a new
file on 1st Nov, access it on the 2nd Nov, modify it on the 3rd Nov and copy it
onto separate media on the 4th; when the MACs are viewed on the 5th
however, it will appear to have been accessed and modified before it was
created.

ins

fu
ll r

igh
ts.

As will be explained in the next section, when a carrier file was modified to
include a different file, the modification time was set; when the carrier file
was copied to the floppy drive, it was given a creation time that was after the
modification time. To confuse matters more the carrier file was made using
a program that retained the MAC times of the original carried files. Thus
when the carried files are exported from the carrier file a new instance is
written to the new media and although this will have a different creation time
again, it will retain the original accessed and modification times.

Having examined the data obtained from various sources and parts of the disk, the

Before 23 April 2004, a Mr Robert John Leszczynski, Jr., who was employed
by Ballard Industries as the lead process control engineer for the project to
design a new fuel cell battery. Mr RJ Leszczynski, it is believed, brought a

This program may have been brought in file by file to prevent detection, as
the CamShell.dll file had deleted been on floppy disk until it was deleted.
The program was probably installed on a Ballard Ind. PC and this could be
confirmed by scanning all systems to which Leszczynski would have had
access, looking for the CamShell.dll file or remnants of it having been there.

SA

The Camouflage program was used to hide 4 files for transportation out of
the company grounds. The files being 2 graphical pictures and 1 an image of
a report, the 4th file was a MS database of what appears to be clients’ details.
Fortunately the Camouflage program stores the original MAC times from the
files as can be seen in items 20 and 21.
Once the Camouflage program had been used to make carrier files out of the
Password_Policy.doc and Remote_Assess_Policy.doc files [believed
to be 23 Apr 2004 @ 1155 & 1154 hours respectively].
These carrier files and four other word documents (policy documents from
Ballard Ind.) were copied onto the Floppy disk [believed to be 26 Apr 2004 @

0946 hours]. These files accessed at some point on 26 Apr 2004, but as
Microsoft does note record access times, only dates, specific data is not
available.

igh
ts.

As Mr RJ Leszczynski, went to leave the building at the end of the day he
was stopped and the disk impounded. As the disk is logically labelled with
his initials and he was in possession of it when stopped, it is suggested that
Mr RJ Leszczynski was exporting information that he had access to, to
outside the boundary of Ballard Ind. However, analysis of his work pc would
reveal more information about his activities, and it is recommended that this
is undertaken before it is used/switched on again.

The Software found and possibly used by Leszczynski

©

The program found on the disk went by the name of Camouflage. It is a
Steganographic Program that hides user selected data inside carrier files. The
following is a quote from a mirror of the old Camouflage web site12:
“What is Camouflage?
Camouflage allows you to hide files by scrambling them and then attaching
them to the file of your choice. This camouflaged file then looks and behaves
like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without attracting
attention. For example, you could create a picture file that looks and

behaves exactly like any other picture file but contains hidden encrypted
files, or you could hide a file inside a Word document that would not attract
attention if discovered. Such files can later be safely extracted. For additional
security you can password your camouflaged file. This password will be
required when extracting the files within. You can even camouflage files
within camouflaged files. Camouflage was written for use with Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT and Windows 2000, and is simple
to install and use.”

igh
ts.

An attempt to recreate the image made by Mr R J Leszczynski failed in that the md5
hashes of the output file are not the same. That said it is unlikely that they would as
the files would be different given the different MAC times that would accompany the
files that are inserted, see below:

his HDD; this will confirm or otherwise the presence of pre or post
camouflaged files.
2.
Prevent Mr R J Leszczynski from having any access to his or any
Company system, all of his accounts should be frozen immediately and any
current sessions terminated immediately; in case he tries to destroy
evidence.

sti

As suggested above, although there has been no Criminal Law breach, the
Corporate Espionage that appears to have been conducted can be addressed
through the UK civil courts. Furthermore, this procedure carries less risk for the
Company and achieves results considerably quicker. Having consulted with several
UK IT Security lawyers it was confirmed that a Criminal case can take upto 18
months from the incident to appear in court. Additionally, the incident is turned over
to the UK Police, who conduct the investigation as best they can with shifting
priorities and reducing resources.
The civil court route places the responsibility in the Company’s hands as they
choose their investigators and legal team. The lawyers consulted spoke of cases
taking less then 4 months from incident to the court case and the aware of
damages.
Furthermore, the weight of argument required in a civilian court is less as ‘the

court.
As to breaching Ballard’s own Policies, the position is not clear cut there either:
Acceptable Encryption Policy
The Camouflage program is Steganographic and therefore only hides the
data it does not encrypt it, therefore the Acceptable Encryption Policy has not
been breached.

igh

Information Sensitivity Policy

fu
ll r

Here the subject could claim they were not aware of the sensitivity of the
data he exported; however, this is unlikely to stand up to the balance of
probabilities (remembering he had probably worked there for some time as
he was the lead engineer) and there was no accident to the hiding and
passwording of these files.

In summary Mr R J Leszczynski has beached the company policy on Information
Sensitivity, and given it was on the disk with which he caused the breach, he cannot
argue that he was not aware of it either (double whammy!). It would be for the
civilian court process to decide on the level of damages that could be awarded
following a successful case, but before that is undertaken the search and seizure of
the media at Mr R J Leszczynski’s private address should be undertaken to ensure
that data is returned to the data owner and that the full extent of his activities are
declared to the courts.

IT Forensic Analysis of an abandoned computer and its
Hard Disk
Background

igh
ts.

On the 31st of August 2004, while depositing some refuse at the local tip a computer
was found discarded. Inquiries with the local operative revealed that the system
had been left there the previous day. Without opening the system up, a payment of
£3 (approx ~$5) was requested from the site manage, as contribution to their ‘tea
fund’. Later investigations revealed the system to be an excellent purchase as can
be seen:

The system was the removed from the facility and returned to an examination area

electrical safety check record (dated 16 April 02 to expire 16 April 03) hinting to a
production system as apposed to a home use one ; additionally the tower case from
this manufacturer ‘Epic PCs’14 also suggests the use was not a personal one.

Forensic Laptop Specification

igh
ts.

The forensic Laptop used for this examination was a Dell Inspiron 5100. The
specification of the laptop being; Intel Pentium 4 2800 MHz with 768Mb RAM, a
CDR/RW and 3com on board network card. The graphics processor was a 64 mb
Mobile ATI card with a 1024x768 TFT screen. It boasts a IEEE 1394 port as well as
2 x USB 2 ports. This laptop has more than proven itself in the past and the
performance of each of the components has been well above standard without the
need for specialist drivers. It will accept over 15 different distributions of Linux and
has run Windows from 95 – 2003 Enterprise Server. As the caddie cost in the
region of £30 (~$55), the Main Forensic OS was a free distribution(FC2) and the
laptop (inc 2 extra HDD and internal caddie drives) cost £550 (~$1030) the whole
forensic outfit was comparatively cheep £580 ($1085).

eta

ins

fu
ll r

The only glitch that was presented was with the use of the external caddie which
connects IDE devices to either IEEE 1394 or USB2. While MS Windows was able
to address the device, Fedora Core 2 did not have any support for it in the kernel.
That said some research on the internet did reveal a patch had been submitted (see
below) which when applied allowed the external caddie to be mounted in the
Fedora Core 2 (FC2) OS in read only mode.

Legal Implications of using the abandoned computer
Given the circumstances under which the system was acquired, it is worth

recounting the legal position the author is in regarding the ownership of the system.
Section 5(1) of the Theft Act 1968 provides a legal defence to the finder of items of
property that the owner has abandoned:
Item 34 – Legal defence for Theft

5. Belonging to another
(1) Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession
or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an
equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an
interest).

Further clarification was listed as being:

fu
ll r

If property is genuinely and honestly abandoned then it cannot be theft
because it belongs to no one.

eta

ins

However, as the item was effectively given to the site for disposal it is their property
and thus the £3 payment can be considered sufficient given that the condition of the
system was not known and that it had been left outside in the rain overnight.

The fact that the system had been left at a refuse tip led the author to believe that
the owner had abandoned his rights of ownership of the hardware. This is a legal
position under Section 2 of the Theft Act 1968, which allow anyone to claim
ownership of the property if they believe the owner has given up the ownership of
the property.
Content that the system had been legitimately acquired, analysis could commence.

Basic Analysis

The Hard disk was installed into the external caddie and connected to the USB port
of the investigators patched laptop. The Linux dd command was used to copy
portions of the /dev directory in an attempt to identify which directory the drive had
been mounted to. This had proved in the investigators experience to be the best
method as the /dev directory used by the kernel varied between devices and USB
ports. The procedure involved using dd with the syntax below:

©

#/ dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/mount_test1
This was executed and allowed to run for several seconds before being interrupted
and the output file being examined with vi. If the output file was blank a different
/dev/ folder would b selected. Success was often being achieved within 2
guesses.
Once the correct directory was identified a dcfldd18 command was executed to
image the whole drive.

Item 35 – Imaging in progress

igh
ts.

The dcfldd command (written by the Defence Computer Forensics Laboratory as
indicated by the ‘dcfl’ bit inform of the dd) was used image process as it is an
improvement over the native dd command. The labs basically modified the native
dd command so it performs an MD5 hash of the HDD as it images it (in the above
screenshot it is the ‘hashlog’) and it also displays the counters showing the
progress of the execution.

Once the whole disk image had been performed an md5 hash was taken of the
source drive and this was compared with dcfldd hashlog. As these were found to
be exactly the same the investigator has assumed the image file to be a bit-for-bit
copy of the /dev/sda drive. The image of the drive that then obtained file was made
read only (using the chmod 444 <image_file> command). To prevent any file
handling errors from disrupting the investigation, the image file was copied to a
different folder /root/datavault to allow copies to be made should a working
copy be corrupted in any way. Once copied to the second location, an md5 hash
was taken and stored in a separate file in the /root/datavault. This hash
matched the original image file and the source drive itself and would serve as a
reference should any one wish to confirm the authenticity of any file used or
obtained during this investigation.

Therefore, it is assumed that the hard disk was formatted with either Windows 95

With the image marked as read-only in the Linux file permissions, the image was
mounted as a loop-back read only device in the /mnt/unknown directory. This

Additionally, as both the mount command and the Linux file permissions were set to
read-only, browsing could be undertaken without fear of altering the data.

A cursory examination of this the root of the system, would confirm the file
identification of the early personal edition of Windows. Files like the
autoexec.bat and config.sys are not used on windows NT (any version) and
the FAT32 file structure was not readable by NT. In order that we might learn the
install date of the operating system the ls command was executed with the ‘ -abo ’
switches. These have the effect of displaying (taken from the ls manual):

This produced the following output:

It is a known fact that Windows 9x and ME used fixed dates for the creation times
and dates for its system files, directories and applications installed from the
CDROM. However, as the OS is installed on the disk the new directories created
as a result of the OS operation will be given the local, natural, real time and date
settings (assuming the end user set the time and time zone correctly). Therefore, is
can be assumed that the OS was installed on 2nd February 2004 given the data
associated with the ‘Windows’, ‘My Documents’, ‘Program Files’ directories
and the stamps on the setuplogs.old, setup.txt and system.1st files.
While some time and date errors have been found, the windows process of
requesting the user to set the correct date, time and time zone are at this point

Finally, vi is used to display the contents of the command.com file as this would be
used to start a command shell and MS Windows OS always reports the host OS at
the top of any new shell. The screenshot below confirms the presence of a

and directory structure, the OS, the systems hardware and the manner and style of
disposal. The assessment is split into factors for the business use and factors for
the private use.

Business Use:

Business type case (ie tower).
Electrical Safety Check sticker on the case, would indicate a Health and
Safety requirement for the system owner to ensure the user’s system is safe
to use. The investigator had never heard of any one having such tests
performed on home electrical appliances (due to cost).
The case was very clean inside indicating either regular and thorough
cleaning or the fact the system was in an air conditioned environment.

Personal Use:

Operating System use is a classic home user one.
The age of the operating system (6 years) would indicate it was a outright
purchase and not on contract for regular or frequent updating.
3.
The system was a reasonable specification and in business would most
likely have been reused for some other task as it met the min spec for
Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2003 Server and XP Pro (or home).
However, given the current specification of home systems is would be
considered dated and limited.

The Team17 folder would indicate the presence of a game (as Team17
install their games to these folders eg Worms), unlikely (but not impossible)

The system appears to be both and it is therefore believed it was indeed
used for business purposes up to some time after 16 April 2002 when the
electrical safety check was performed.
It was then possibly transferred to a home user where most recently on the
2nd February 2004 Windows 98 was installed.

Key areas and direction for Detailed Analysis

It is important when performing any detailed task to have both objectives and
direction otherwise time and effort can be wasted proving points that are not
relevant or of value to the investigation. The following will be used to direct
investigation and data recovery during the next stage. The success and
performance of the forensic examination and analysis will be gauged against these
objectives.

Detailed Analysis

The detailed analysis commenced with the starting of the Autopsy (v1.70) and
mounting of the disk images to the software. Autopsy given the investigator the
option to adjust the time zone and mount time of the files to reflect minor
discrepancies in the clock of the system. This would mainly be used when several
systems are being compared and all times need to be accurate to an external
Key fingerprint = AF19 FA27 2F94 998D FDB5 DE3D F8B5 06E4 A169 4E46
reference. As this was the only system being analysed, it was not necessary and
the time zone was set only to Greenwich Mean Time and British Summer Time
(GMTBST).

Once mounted the system was subject to an md5 hash and this was compared to
that of the original dcfldd hashoutput. Next the file browser window was
opened and a general examination of the contents of the drive was conducted. The
date and time that the %systemroot%/win386.swp held should have indicated
the last point at which the OS conducted any swap operations. Swap operations
are where data in memory is ‘paged’ or ‘swapped’ to the hard disk. This is used to
allow the multitasking of the OS to be undertaken when it has insufficient RAM to
host itself, the drivers and the applications.
In a typical Windows system the OS consumed up to 60% of the available RAM so
the swap file was in regular use. When shut down, the swap file is one of the last
files accessed and closed and as a result it is usually a good indication of the last
time the system was used ie 15th July 2004 @ 1937 hours (GMTBST). However,
the file picture directly above the win386.swp is the win.ini file, which is used
store the configuration of the OS (only Win 9x and ME used this feature as the
registry is used by NT, 2000, XP and 2003), and this file has a date of 17th August

The creation of the time line was the next objective. This would show the creation,
modification and access times (MAC) for all current files. It would also obtain from
the meta data the MACs for the files that have been deleted, this is less accurate as
the meta data deteriorates when parts of the disk are reused. However, as we
believe the system was a home PC that may have been used by a business, some

As can be seen above the time line revealed some very confusing data, especially
given the assumption that the system was not used after 15 Jul 2004 when the
windows swap file was last accessed. Although, the clock was believed to be
inaccurate (being out by approximately 27 days and 62 minutes), some MACs
claimed creating and access dates in the 1930s! This may be attributable to meta
data being corrupt as few computers will allow their clock to be set so far in the
past.

Ignoring the 1930s data, the last entry is the c:\scandisk.log which has a time
stamp of 22nd August 2004 11:55 and 16 seconds. An examination of the log itself
reveals the entry which matches the timestamp. Interestingly though, the
scandisk.log file was created on 2nd Feb 2004 – the believed built date for the
OS., however, the first scan recorded is on 11th Aug 2004 (and this was cancelled)
only indicating a developing problem that required more and more attention from the
user. Below is a summary of the scandisk.log file that has had the extra
carriage returns removed and where a scan revealed no problem the text was

What is apparent is that the first check was requested/required by either the user of
the system (upon boot), on 11 Aug 2004 then over the next 11 days a further 23
scans were imitated. This would indicate a failing of either the physical disk, the
operating system or the presence of some software that was causing the system to
crash, whereupon reboot a scandisk would automatically be invoked (and
conducted unless cancelled by the user).

This hints strongly of a system that is failing and was operational for the last time on
17 Aug 2004. This with the scandisk.log file (above) suggests the user would
attempt to booth the system (generally in the evening) and allowing it to conduct
several scans in an effort to correct whatever problem prevents normal system
operation. The scans do not appear to correct the problem and user gives up after 35 attempts.

fu
ll r

It is the assumption of the investigator that the user gives up on 22 August 2004,
believing the disk to be corrupt elects to scrap the system some time over the next
week.

ins

Why did the system fail?

Given the fact that the investigator was able to image the hard disk without
any problems, it is surmised that the errors on the disk were software related. With
this in mind the investigator looked for recent software installations that may have
corrupted the logical integrity of the operating system on the hard disk.

Peer-2-peer software is a classic method of catching viruses, downloading Trojans
and other Malware or Spyware.

In order that a Windows Spyware and Antivirus program could be loaded and
run against the image, it was necessary to mount the dd image on a samba shared
folder and to sweep the files remotely. First the mount command was used to
mount the image onto the /mnt/windows_forensic_server directory which
samba had been configured serve via Windows SMB file sharing protocol. Access
was restricted to a the sole Windows system to be used to conduct further analysis.
Although the image file itself is read only, the mount point is also defined as being
read only.

The set up was as follows:

The Laptop applied samba share level permissions to the Administrator of the
Windows XP desktop. This intern was connected via a separate network card with
a different address to a switch. The switch allowed access to the Green Interface
on the Smoothwall26 <www.smoothwall.org> Internet Firewall. The internet
connection was enabled on the XP Pro system when an item required researching
on the Internet, otherwise it was disabled. To reach the image from the internet, an
attacker would be required to defeat the Smoothwall Firewall, identify the internal
NATed address range, defeat the Norton Personal Firewall installed on the XP Pro
system, enable IP Forwarding or install Windows Internet Connection Sharing (ICS),
identify the IP Address of the Linux system and defeat the OS firewall installed.
Therefore the investigator considered the read only samba shared data to
reasonably safe – although as mentioned the connection to the Internet was limited
and tightly controlled.

The purpose of the samba share was to allow the use of windows based tools (with
which the investigator was more familiar). Upon connecting to the read only
network share, a complete copy of the contents was taken to a temporary directory
E:\GIAC SANS TEMP\. This was in case any of the Trojan hunting software tried
to remove or alter the data. Although the data was safe, AntiVirus and Anti Malware
software have a bad habit of freezing when they attempted to delete data that was
prohibited by more than the system’s own file permissions. Note as standard
practice, all products were updated moments before being used on the target
image.

AntiVirus, Trojan and Malware Scans
The investigator recognised that the fact that only complete files were visible and
that any viruses etc held in slack or unused space would not be found by searching
through samba shared data, he believed there would be sufficient to be going on,
furthermore, a full slack and deleted file search would be conducted on the host
Linux system.

igh
ts.

The first a Virus Scan was performed using Norton Anti Virus a good produce that
the investigator is familiar with, it is configurable and it will detect Trojans, Viruses,
Worms and {as we will see only some} Malware. On this occasion it revealed one
virus called ‘polmx2.cab’ which it classed as a Trojan.

The second Virus scan (its always a good idea to do at least two), was performed
by the Free AVG Antivirus28 tool <http://www.grisoft.com> this revealed a
significantly larger number, 32! Although this may be because of the overlap in
what AVG, Norton and Spyware Doctor29 all scan for.

Next up was a scan for Spyware, this was conducted using the PCtools Spyware
Doctor (www.pctools.com/spyware-doctor). If the Norton result was bad, the
Spyware doctor result was horrendous, as it discovered 85 instances of Spyware or

The user became aware of the number of item of Spyware to the point where
they took action and removed something critical.

The system simply failed under then number of malicious item of software

Or both, in that the system caused so many problems that the user took action and
the software used caused the system to fail by either removing an infected file that
was critical to the OS or by failing to install itself properly and corrupting the system
partition in the process.

it these is the case. Some items have been highlighted in the next portion of the
time line:
The red indicate the presence of a malicious file or Trojan.
The blue indicate the presence of a defensive tool.

System ownership and why this happened
Having identified why the system was abandoned, the investigator turned his
attention to the other information that could be obtained from the system as to its
usage, the owner and the type of use the system was put to. Note this aspect of
the report is heavily sanitised.

The first and main point of call when examining a windows system is the registry.
The registry in Windows 98 was quit embryonic when compared to the likes of
Windows XP, with its separate user logons, separate data storage area and even
separate software installs and permissions. When Microsoft was designing
Windows 98 they assumed the person sat in front of the system was authorised to
see and access all data. In modern IT Security terms it was a dedicated operating
system. As a result there is no ability to discern the particular users at any set time
other than by their actual activity and behaviour. There is no logon security on
Windows 98, the login process it simply for network shares and to prevent other
users seeing each others desktops (laughable as there was no file security from
preventing them from navigating to the files and desktop directory once ‘logged on’.

User activity on this system is split into several areas:
General Family type stuff – saving and printing digital pictures.
Playing computer games – ‘Worms’, ‘The Land before time’ and
‘Totally Spies’ (free from UK McDonalds during summer 2004)
c.
Using an instant messenger (zango)

Watching films/DVDs (generally using the bundled bespoke software).

Many of the default and unnecessary icons were still on the desktop.
Many of the Spyware programs conducted a social engineering attack
and the user seems to have been duped into installing them. A
classic example being the Internet Optimizer itself a browser hijacker32
(see <http://www.2-spyware.com/browser-hijackers-removal>
The fact that they were connected to the internet via broadband and

The user was relatively new to computing and did not really understand much of
what was going on. For example:

By the 8th August 2004 they appear to have become annoyed with the popups their
Spyware was generating and they installed popup stopper. But given the number of
items of Spyware and the fact that many had been legitimately installed (having
duped the user), this had little chance of stopping the problem, furthermore, they
were only treating the symptoms and not the cause.

The only points that jump out from the above list are that the investigator hopes the
user didn’t use this system for online banking with Lloydstsb as several of the
Spyware and Trojans installed were capable of keystroke logging. And it is a
shame they didn’t stop longer at the Zonelabs site, even the free personal firewall
would have been useful.

The question as to whether the use conducted any illegal activity can be a difficult
one to answer as it can depend on many things. The pornography for example is
explicit but as to its breach of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 & 64 (OPA) the
investigator turned to the Internet Watch Foundation <www.ifw.org.uk> for advice.
On their site the OPA is defined as:

The law on obscene publications is difficult to define in everyday terms.
As a guide it could include images featuring acts of extreme sexual activity such as bestiality,
necrophilia, rape or torture.
Key fingerprint = AF19 FA27 2F94 998D FDB5 DE3D F8B5 06E4 A169 4E46
This act makes it an offence to publish, whether for gain or not, any article whose effect, taken
as a whole, is such, in the view of the court, to tend to "deprave and corrupt" those likely to
read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.

Although the names of the pornography video files did include on several occasions
the words rape, the belief is that many are either ‘staged’ or simply advertising tricks
to increase hits. Note – this was professional advice obtained by the investigator
from persons employed in these types of investigations. Apparently, this is a
common renaming trick used by site owners to increase the size of their libraries
and to maintain customer interest. Detailed analysis of these files was not
performed.
There were also 30 music files and music videos, mainly of Elvis. They type and
quality of these indicates they were originally released by one of the major recording
labels. Their presence on the hard disk itself in not sufficient to prove they were
illegally obtained however, they are in two locations:
C:\My Shared

53 of 57

C:\Program Files\Grokster\My Shared Folder

With online music purchasing increasing exponentially in the UK, the user may
have an external device or other system where they legally acquire the files.
However, it is the belief of the investigator that given the other files in these folders
(ie pornography) which are unlikely to be ‘purchased’ these music videos were also
downloaded via the peer-to-peer software especially as there were 4 different types
of peer-to-peer applications.

Therefore, a breach of the recording labels licence’s and IPR has occurred.
However, this is currently a topical subject both in the USA and Europe with USA

have yet to be determined.

Summary of events and supposition by the investigator

©

The following is the summary of the events; the system was built in February 2004,
with Windows 98 OSR2. It was used mainly by one individual, probably male who
occasionally allowed others to access games or the internet. The user was not
security orientated or particularly computer literate as much of the problem
stemmed from the lack of basic internet security devices ie a Firewall and AntiVirus
(although from this investigation not even Norton could have helped him). The user
elected to install several ‘free’ internet accelerators and dubious software touting to
be popup stoppers etc.
The installation of several peer-to-peer program facilitated the increase in

downloaded software of dubious sources and the volume of pornography installed
on the system hints to broadband being installed – there is a reference to NTL
broadband medic in the unallocated space but much of this data is corrupt. The
user seems to have become aware of the Spyware as a popup blocker is installed
and a few weeks later the installation of Spyware-blocker is seemingly started,
however possibly due to so many files being infected and corrupted or hardware
failure, the system crashed during the install and despite attempts over several days
the system is never again operational.

igh
ts.

It was noted that the user had considered purchasing a new machine as several
references to Dell <www.dell.co.uk> were seen in the cache and the Internet
Explorer history points to the commencement or at least pricing of a Dell
Dimension 2400.

Conclusions and points learnt

eta

ins

fu
ll r

When the system finally fails to boot on 22 August 2004 the user makes the
decision to dispose of it. They remove the memory and, judging by the software
and media players installed (one from X-Men2 and Nero Burning ROM), a
DVDR/CDRW 51/2” device (see the images at the start). Then either believing that
no data can be recovered or not knowing about data forensics, the case is then
dumped at the local refuse facility, where the investigator spots it the next day.

The failure of the hard disk – either its hardware or its logical structure did present
significant problems for the forensic investigator. Furthermore, using a system
obtained in this manner was a risk, as the disk may have been completely clean,
well maintained ie with little meat for the report or loaded with child pornography or
images
of that nature.

As it was, the system proved to be a even more of a challenge than originally
expected as the numerous items of Malware, the failing structure and 23 scandisk
executions all added to the tangled web of corrupt data and misleading facts. The
fact that the BIOS clock was significantly out of sync with GMT also didn’t help.

This system was an easy target for Malware and viruses as it had everything going
for it; no antivirus software, no firewall, numerous peer-to-peer applications and
several browser hijacking programs (and an uneducated user). The system lasted
just under 9 months but given the sites and user activity it did well to last that long,
especially as much of the problem was user installed under a social engineering
attack aimed to trick them to thinking they would fit their problems.
Personal Statement:
I was honestly saddened by the death of this system, a strange but true comment. I
believe that over the course of the investigation I have gotten to know this system
well, as I discovered its habits and foibles. The process of investigating the reason

for its disposal was an interesting journey that had me slowly piece the gruesome
facts about the demise of this operating system. I was horrified when I approached
the time line entries for 17 August 2004 as they pointed to the scandisk logs that in
simple black and white showed how the system had not managed to reboot and
correct itself despite numerous attempts – like watching someone drowning I
suppose. Ironically, the fatal blow seems to have come from a piece of software
designed to remove and protect the system from the numerous items of Spyware
and Trojans that it housed.

• Courts require expert witness to submit written
reports
• Written report must specify fees paid for the
expert’s services
– And list all other civil or criminal cases in which the
expert has testified

• Deposition banks
– Examples of expert witness’ previous testimonies
Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations

3

Limiting a Report to Specifics
• All reports to clients should start with the job
mission or goal
– Find information on a specific subject
– Recover certain significant documents
– Recover certain types of files

• Before you begin writing, identify your audience
and the purpose of the report

Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations

4

Types of Reports
• Computer forensics examiners are required to
create different types of reports
• Examination plan
– What questions to expect when testifying
– Attorney uses the examination plan to guide you in
your testimony
– You can propose changes to clarify or define
information
– Helps your attorney learn the terms and functions
used in computer forensics

– Limit what you write and pay attention to details
• Include thorough documentation and support of what
you write

Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations

8

Guidelines for Writing Reports
• Hypothetical questions based on factual evidence
– Less favored today
– Guide and support your opinion
– Can be abused and overly complex

• Opinions based on knowledge and experience
• Exclude from hypothetical questions
– Facts that can change, cannot be used, or are not
relevant to your opinion

Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations

9

Guidelines for Writing Reports
(continued)
• As an expert witness, you may testify to an opinion,
or conclusion, if four basic conditions are met:
– Opinion, inferences, or conclusions depend on
special knowledge or skills
– Expert should qualify as a true expert
– Expert must testify to a certain degree of certainty
– Experts must describe facts on which their opinions
are based, or they must testify to a hypothetical
question
Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations

10

What to Include in Written Preliminary
Reports
• Anything you write down as part of your
examination for a report
– Subject to discovery from the opposing attorney

• Considered high-risk documents
• Spoliation
– Destroying the report could be considered
destroying or concealing evidence

• Include the same information as in verbal reports

Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations

11

What to Include in Written Preliminary
Reports (continued)
• Additional items to include in your report:
– Summarize your billing to date and estimate costs to
complete the effort
– Identify the tentative conclusion (rather than the
preliminary conclusion)
– Identify areas for further investigation and obtain
confirmation from the attorney on the scope of your
examination

17

Designing the Layout and Presentation
of Reports (continued)
• Providing supporting material
– Use material such as figures, tables, data, and
equations to help tell the story as it unfolds

• Formatting consistently
– How you format text is less important than being
consistent in applying formatting

• Explaining examination and data collection
methods
– Explain how you studied the problem, which should
follow logically from the purpose of the report

Introduction

This Guide has been produced as a follow on to the Council of Europe Electronic Evidence Guide1,
which was developed as a basic guide for police officers, prosecutors and judges. The Electronic
Evidence Guide provides guidance on the steps to be taken to secure electronic evidence, for
example at a crime scene and to ensure its evidential integrity is maintained until it is passed to
digital forensics laboratory for further action. The present Guide takes the reader to the next
stages of activity in the digital forensics arena. In addition to the practical processes and
procedures to be followed in a laboratory environment, it deals with the management issues
involved in the running of a laboratory and also the strategic considerations in establishing such a
laboratory.
This Guide should also be at the disposal of prosecutors and judges. Although members of the
judiciary are not obliged to be well acquainted or specialised in skills other than legal,
contemporary criminal acts and their perpetrators are putting additional pressure on professionals
both in prosecution services and courts to better understand and enhance their knowledge of
cybercrime and raise their capabilities to render decisions in criminal cases on cybercrime or
electronic evidence.

1.1

The purpose of the Guide

1.1.1

What is included

The purpose of the Guide is to provide support and guidance to managers and practitioners of
digital forensics laboratories in the setting up and running of such laboratories in such a way that
any evidence produced by them is dealt with in such a manner that will ensure its authenticity for
later admissibility in court. Although the Guide is not intended to be an instruction manual with
step-by-step directions, it does provide an overview of the kinds of issues that often arise when
developing and running a digital forensics laboratory and offers advice on how to deal with them.
Readers of this document should check if such advice already exists at the national level.

1.1.2

What is not included

The guide does not make any recommendations regarding hardware and software choices that may
be available. Each country and organisation will decide what is appropriate given their needs and
available funds. It should be remembered that digital forensics equipment and commercial software
can be a very expensive long term commitment and is not easy to change once the initial decision
is made. Details of the types of costs associated with forensic software purchases and information
about some options to use open source software are dealt with elsewhere in this document.

Digital Forensics Guide

This Guide and the information contained in it are considered valid until 31 December
2018. Where conditions permit the Guide will be updated before that date to reflect any
relevant changes in technology, procedures and practices. Any person or organisation
wishing to use the Guide after the above date should contact the Council of Europe to
obtain the most recent version.

1.2

Who is the Guide for?

This Guide is designed for two specific categories of reader:
1.

Those responsible for the development and management of their digital forensics
laboratory that will form part of an overall digital forensics strategy,

2.

Staff employed within a digital forensics laboratory, in technical roles relating to the
digital forensics processes and procedures.

The guidance for the first group is designed to assist those responsible for developing digital
forensic strategies, making decisions about building the capacity to deal with digital forensics and
for those responsible for the management of laboratories. It is recognised that there is no single
solution applicable to all countries or even different organisations within countries. The guide is
designed to assist managers to make decisions about a subject with which many may not be
familiar.
The second group consists of those with direct responsibility of laboratory activities and the staff
that will carry out the function of acquisition, processing analysing and presenting electronic
evidence.

The guidance for this group will be more specific to the functions related to the

electronic evidence process and will allow procedures to be adopted that will meet requirements of
national and international criminal justice systems.
As aforementioned, prosecutors, judges, prosecutorial and court assistants and other staff included
in criminal proceedings on substantive level, should be introduced to the contents of this guide in
parts which are of vital interest for the cases in their competence.

1.3

How should the Guide be used?

This Guide should be seen as a template document that can be used by countries to consider when
developing their digital forensics capability.

The advice given is intended to be used at both

strategic and tactical levels, according to their national legislation, practice and procedure.
The overarching principles described in the Electronic Evidence Guide are just as relevant to the
procedures conducted in the laboratory environment and are in accordance with generally accepted
good practice for dealing with electronic evidence. The principles are set out below to reinforce
their importance:
Principle 1 – Data integrity
No action taken should materially change any data, electronic device or media which may
7

Digital Forensics Guide

subsequently be used as evidence in court.
Principle 2 – Audit trail
A record of all actions taken when handling electronic evidence should be created and preserved so
that they can be subsequently audited. An independent third party should not only be able to
repeat those actions, but also to achieve the same result.
Principle 3 – Specialist support
If it is expected that electronic evidence may be found in the course of a planned operation, the
person in charge of the operation should notify specialists/external advisers in time and to arrange
their presence if possible.
Principle 4 – Appropriate training
First responders must have the necessary and appropriate training to be able to search for and
seize electronic evidence if no specialists are available at the scene.
Principle 5 - Legality
The person and agency in charge of the case are responsible for ensuring that the law, the
evidential safeguards and the general forensic and procedural principles are followed to the letter.
Further explanation of the principles is to be found in the Electronic Evidence Guide.
Readers should ensure that they are fully conversant with the laws of their own countries related to
the digital forensics process and the admissibility of evidence adduced therefrom. National law
should always be the primary point of reference. Advice given in the Guide is not expected or
intended to contradict any national legislation and is at all times subject to national laws, rules and
procedures.

Digital Forensics Guide

Prosecutor's considerations
Prosecutors’ considerations are very important for criminal justice officials who are
involved in the development and management of a digital forensics laboratory and for the
technical staff employed of a digital forensics laboratory, since the outcome of the digital
forensics process should be valid evidence representing a cornerstone for prosecutorial
decisions in a criminal case.
Depending on the country’s criminal law framework, the involvement of prosecutors will
be needed at different stages of the criminal justice process. In some jurisdictions, the
prosecution will only request a digital forensics expert opinion. In others, the prosecution
will be more involved in the expertise processes, including involvement in particular
phases of the process itself. In some jurisdictions, prosecutors have an advisory role or
legal responsibility for the investigation process.
Irrespective of the legal framework, it is very likely that prosecutors will be first judiciary
officials who are going to be presented with evidence resulting from the digital forensic
process.
Therefore, this guide, together with the Council of Europe Electronic Evidence Guide,
should be accessible to prosecutors and other parties involved in the criminal justice
process.

1.5

What is digital forensics

Digital Forensics is the branch of forensic science that focuses on identifying, acquiring, processing,
analysing and reporting on data stored on a computer system, digital device or other storage
media.
Each and every branch of Digital Forensics requires extensive training and experience making it
impossible for one forensic examiner to be expert in all areas. The following chart shows the main
subcategories and subject areas of Digital Forensics.

In large countries, it is possible to have individual staff knowledgeable and skilled in each of the
above disciplines. However in countries with a lower level of resources, it will be necessary to
examine how the available resources may be put to best effect. This may involve outsourcing some
activities or multi-skilling staff.

Management of a digital forensic laboratory

In this day and age it is not uncommon to find that all types of criminal acts are being carried with
the use of the Internet, mobile devices and computers. In some parts of the world this type of
criminal activity accounts for the majority of criminal investigations.

It is safe to say that as

technology advances and becomes more affordable – so too will the use of digital data to research,
facilitate and carry out various types of crime.
Digital forensic laboratories are being set up regularly by law enforcement agencies around the
world. Some are professionally scoped and heavily invested in and others may be one officer with a
computer and freely available forensic tools. Anyone who contemplates setting up and relying on a
digital forensic laboratory should carefully research the requirements of their jurisdiction, ensuring
they consult with the other players in the criminal justice system of the country.

2.1

Research

Initial research should be conducted to establish recent statistics on the seizure of digital devices,
the types of crimes, the location, specialism of the seizing officers and what, if any digital forensic
analysis has been carried out. This information should give a fair guide of how quickly this type of
investigation is growing and where to start when considering the initial size of a digital forensic
laboratory and identifying the need for investment. The research should establish if there are any
legal or procedural requirements that cover the creation and management of forensics services
within the criminal justice system. Comparison with countries of similar geography and
demographics, that have already established a digital forensics capability, will be a beneficial
exercise.
Finding the answer to the following questions will assist decision makers to understand and
recognise the scope of the requirements of the digital forensic laboratory that is to be created:


How many reported crimes have been facilitated with the use of digital data in the last 3
years, 2 years and 1 year?



Is there an obvious and documented growth of this type of investigation?



If digital forensic investigation has been required,



-

Who conducted the analysis?

-

Where procedures were followed?

-

What was the outcome?

-

What was the cost of the examinations?

-

Were some functions not able to be conducted with available resources?

Are there other law enforcement agencies who have a similar requirement and could
collaboration expedite the acceptance of any business case submitted?

13

Digital Forensics Guide

Once this initial research has been conducted, decision makers should have a better idea about the
role and the size of the digital forensic laboratory as well as the number of staff required to provide
an effective resource to all stakeholders.

2.2

Budgeting/capacity

There are many factors to consider when completing a Business Case, not least of which is the
overall cost. This can be broken down into two main areas:


The initial ‘one off’ outlay (capital costs) – Premises, refurbishment, security, office/lab
equipment, hardware and software.



Ongoing costs – staff, training, software licenses, counseling, etc.

The following chapters will assist with the specific considerations for each of these areas and will
provide more detailed information to assist with the setting up of a digital forensic laboratory that
is fit for purpose, scalable and resilient.

2.3

Premises

Demand and budgets will play a significant part in the availability, size and location of suitable
premises. When identifying suitable premises the following factors should be considered:

2.3.1

Security

The premises will need to provide adequate security to store and investigate sensitive evidential
data. It is not only the evidential data that needs to be secured, but managers must also consider
the security of personal information, valuable software and hardware, actual exhibits and personal
information pertaining to employed staff.
Preventing unauthorised entry and monitoring visitors to the premises should protect the access to
the laboratory. Due to the sensitive data held within a digital forensic laboratory – it is advisable
to have some form of record of entry and exit to assist with maintaining the continuity of the
evidence within. The simplest way to do this is to have a witnessed signing in/out book but this
requires a second person to be always present. Other types of access control include physical locks
and keys, electronic keypads, swipe cards, CCTV and biometrics.
The premises should, ideally be alarmed with motion sensors in each room and at each entry point
(external doors and windows). The windows and doors should be re-enforced to prevent nonauthorised entry and theft and be covered to prevent observation of from external sources.
Fire detection and ‘dry’ fire quenching is also important and should be in place to protect people,
property and evidence.
Off-site back up of electronic evidence held on servers should be considered mandatory and
included in any security policy.

14

Digital Forensics Guide

2.3.2

Location

Several factors will come into place when considering the location of any digital forensic laboratory.
The availability of suitable premises will be a major factor in identifying the appropriate location.
Ideally, a property in a central location would be a preferred choice. After identifying the business
area that the laboratory will be service and the location from which the exhibits will be seized a
more informed choice of location will be identified in the business case.
Ideally the Laboratory should be within another building as this provides additional security and
resilience. It is better not to have windows or as few as possible, because these are a vulnerability
to the security of the office and increase the possibility that the sensitive data could be observed
from outside. If the identified location does have windows, they should be secured with bars or
shutters and any glass should be frosted or opaque.
The delivery to and examination of evidence in the digital forensic laboratory should not be
hindered by its physical location. Considerations about the physical location should include;


If it is above the ground floor, is there a lift available to transport large quantities of
computer evidence?



If a large quantity of electronic evidence is to be delivered – how safe is the property in
the vehicle.



How far away is the car park to the laboratory?



Is the building or office robust enough to ensure the security of the data and protect the
people within?



Are the walls, floor and ceiling strong enough to withstand physical or environmental
damage?



What is the risk from flood, fire, natural disasters and civil unrest?



Incursion by terrorist or criminal organisations seeking to damage investigations.

2.3.3

Size

When considering the size of any laboratory, considerations that account for the various tasks that
will be conducted within must be made. It is best practice to try and segregate the specific types of
activities to prevent cross contamination and loss of exhibits.
A reception type area where evidence can be delivered or collected without allowing access to the
actual laboratory should be incorporated in the planning of the digital forensic laboratory. A high
priority is the need for a secure area to store exhibits and sensitive data. This should be a room
located within the digital forensic laboratory. Alternatively a fixed metal cage could be used,
depending on the amount of exhibits likely to be stored. Any access to and removal or return of
exhibits to the storage room must be recorded. As with access to the laboratory, there are several
different physical and virtual methods to achieve this.
15

Digital Forensics Guide

There will need to be a laboratory, which is restricted to the forensic analysts of computers and
mobile devices – or both. Each analyst will require a large desk for IT equipment, filing cabinets to
hold their case files and comfortable chairs.
The digital forensic laboratory will need a server – this may be stored securely within the
laboratory and if available, a separate room.
An area designated to imaging and processing will be required – this should be separate to the
analyst’s workstations and should, ideally, be close to the property store to reduce the amount of
manual handling.
A breakout or rest area is important to provide the analysts with an area away from their
investigations.
Considerations for an additional room for briefings or meetings as well as an additional office for
the laboratory manager to utilise are advised.
Some laboratories have a separate ‘viewing’ room to allow for visiting officers/prosecutors to view
their cases without causing distraction to the forensic analysts.
Ideally the office will have its own rest room facilities or there will be one situated in close
proximity.
In addition to the above, areas dedicated to storage of non-evidential equipment like media
copiers, media production equipment, printers, scanners, files, property bags, tags, evidence
labels, storage media, office equipment and personal belongings of staff should be considered in
selecting the most appropriate place to locate a digital forensic laboratory.
The building or office selected should be large enough to expand if there is an anticipated increase
in demand for digital forensic investigation.
Once you have established the required laboratory size, consider the longevity of such a facility.
Many existing digital forensics facilities have found it necessary to relocate or expand in a short
space of time due to exponential increases in workload. The information gathered during the
research phase will give a good idea of the likely need for future expansion. It is extremely
expensive to relocate or expand, so it may be beneficial to provide room for expansion in the initial
business plan.

2.3.4

Air conditioning

Air conditioning is of vital importance, as a room with many working computers will generate a
great deal of heat. If a server is positioned in its own area – this area should be cooled.
Overheating can lead to loss of data and damage to hardware. Ideally an extractor unit should be
purchased and installed in an area to provide greatest comfort to staff and to control the
temperature and humidity of the laboratory. The exhibit storage facility should have its own air
conditioning or climate control system to try to prevent deterioration of stored evidence.

16

Digital Forensics Guide

2.4

Staff

It is likely that the person scoping and preparing the business case will be the laboratory manager
or will be involved in the recruitment of such a Manager. Best practice shows that the laboratory
manager should be involved in the recruiting of the staff that will be employed to carry out the
different roles within the laboratory.
Depending on the size of the laboratory and the required number of staff they must consider the
different functions that are required. Staff roles and responsibilities will need to be documented and
detailed job descriptions should be prepared so that each member of the team has a clear
understanding of their job profile. Where possible the structure of a digital forensics capability
should incrementally allow for staff to be able to advance within the organisation, rather than
leaving. It is accepted that this is only possible within a facility with plentiful resources, however it
should always be an aim. There is strong anecdotal evidence that shows in many digital forensics
laboratories highly qualified staff spend much of their time undertaking mundane tasks below their
level of capability. To avoid this, it is important to recognise the activities to be undertaken should
be clearly defined in the job profiles. The roles and responsibilities that should be considered
include the following:
Laboratory manager
The manager must have some advanced technical knowledge and a strong understanding of the
legislative requirements for electronic evidence as well as the procedures and processes to be
followed. It is vital that the manager understands the overarching principles described in the
Electronic Evidence Guide and reiterated earlier on in these operating processes. The laboratory
manager should have control over the original set up, identifying the building, purchasing
equipment and software and setting the procedures and functions of the laboratory. They should be
responsible for leading the recruiting, training, mentoring, counselling and guidance of everybody
employed within the unit.
Digital forensics analyst - computers
The analysts will require technical knowledge, and where possible appropriate qualifications. Ideally
they should have some training in the use of digital forensic software. Alternately these staff
members will require specific forensic training to bring them up to a suitable skill level. Digital
forensic analysts must have knowledge of legislation and be aware of the points to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
Digital forensics analyst – mobile devices
The analysts will require technical knowledge, and where possible appropriate qualifications. Ideally
they should have some training in the use of mobile device acquisition. Alternately these staff
members will require specific training to bring them up to a suitable skill level. Digital forensic
17

Digital Forensics Guide

analysts must have knowledge of legislation and be aware of the points to prove when
investigating different types of crimes. These roles require an analytical and investigative mind-set;
the digital forensic analyst must be able to deliver their findings in a clear and understandable
format. It is important that digital forensic analysts have good oral and written communication
skills.
Forensic imaging technician
The role of the Imaging Technical is to take forensically sound copies (images) of computer hard
drives and other storage media. Depending on the size of the laboratory, several technicians may
be required. The Forensic Imaging Technician will need to have good technical knowledge and an
understanding of the various methods of forensically acquiring digital data. A key skill requirement
is attention to detail and the ability to clearly document all their actions, the verification of imaged
data and the continuity of evidence.
Administration
An important role within any laboratory is continuity of the evidence and requisite recording of the
chain of custody. Depending on the size of the laboratory and the amount of electronic evidence to
be examined, an administrator role may need to be filled. The administrator would take
responsibility for documenting each new case, checking the exhibit numbers/serial numbers and
case files are all accounted for. Other considerations include


Making decisions about the seriousness of the investigation.



Prioritisation of cases.



Entering the information onto a case management system.



Liaison with outside agencies, police officers and the rest of the laboratory team.



Strong oral and written communication and attention to details.

2.4.1

Recruiting

Recruitment should start as soon as the business case has been accepted and the premises are
identified. Having key staff on hand to assist with the identification and selection of hardware and
software would be beneficial. It may be that these key staff are already trained or are familiar with
a certain type of forensic software and would rather work with this. Ideally the roles and
responsibilities of each vacancy will be established prior to advertising.

2.4.2

Police officers or police support staff?

Some forensic laboratories will be staffed totally by serving police officers, some with only support
staff and others with a combination of both. There are pros and cons for each option.
Police officers tend to have better investigative knowledge and are more familiar with legislation
and points to prove criminal action. They will be less likely to move onto other job opportunities
and will be more used to working unsociable hours.
18

Digital Forensics Guide

Support staff may have more relevant technical qualifications and received more training. They
may have practical experience in the investigation of digital data but may be more inclined to seek
career progression and move to the private sector.
A mixture of both may improve your overall technical ability and provide a more diverse team.

2.4.3

Vetting

Whoever is recruited to work in the digital forensic laboratory will require some form of background
check or security vetting. All staff within the laboratory will have access to sensitive data and
evidence of serious criminal activity. It is important to establish that they or their close family have
not been involved in any criminal activity previously, especially dishonesty offences. It is also
prudent to identify if they have any financial difficulties that may make them susceptible to bribery
or corruption. It is also worth considering any previous affiliation with extreme political groups. It
may be that managers will have access to existing vetting material within their environment or
alternately cover the Vetting criteria during the selection and interview processes.

2.4.4

Staff development and human resources

Once staff are recruited, it is important to continually develop their abilities, motivate and retain
them. The establishment of an achievable staff development program can support this. This must
commence with an induction to their new workplace. Initial documents should clearly illustrate their
role and responsibilities, their reporting manager and their senior manager. These initial documents
must identify any immediate training needs or desires and record arrangements that are agreed to
address this plan. Such arrangements may send staff on training courses or arranging for them to
shadow and learn from colleagues alongside a planned timeframe. For example, all Digital Forensic
Analysts will require externally certificated training to provide them with the confidence to use the
forensics tools and the credibility to deliver reliable evidence in a court. Consideration may be
given to issuing each staff member with a Personal Development Portfolio (PDP), which will contain
an ongoing record of their training and qualifications, as well as milestones achieved in their work
place mentored activities.

Managers may use PDP’s to set targets for individuals that will

collectively within the team create a more balanced and effective capacity.
Advancements in technology are moving at a very fast pace and digital forensics analysts need to
be regularly trained and retrained to keep up to date with the advances in digital forensics science.
Management will also need to set aside some time for these analysts to undertake research and
development. As new tools and applications come onto the market – the analysts should evaluate
them to identify artifacts of value to the digital forensic laboratory.
Staff retention will be key to managing a successful digital forensic laboratory. A great deal of time
and money will be spent on training of staff, and it is vital they are retained, especially once they
are trained and begin to become more experienced. Having robust personal development plans for
each member of staff will give them objectives and a better understanding of their career path and
future opportunities. It must always be remembered that retaining staff is not simply a matter of
salary.

Developing a working environment, where staff can flourish is equally if not more

important.
19

Digital Forensics Guide

There are some guides available, which relate to the desired competencies in the digital forensics
arena:


EU Training Competency Framework on Cybercrime by CEPOL, ECTEG, EuroJust and
Europol EC3 - available via Europol EC3;



A skills matrix being developed (and available in early 2017) as an output of the EU
funded SENTER project.

2.4.4.1 Mentoring
Of equal importance to development and training is staff mentoring. Mentoring is the process
whereby an experienced staff member offers support to a new member of staff during their
probationary period.

If appropriate, the probationary period should be set once the level of

training and development of the individual is identified.
The role of mentor is as guide and support, possibly a friend and confidante, as well as source of
information. It is envisaged that the need for a mentor will diminish as time goes by and will
disappear completely as the new member of staff settles in to their new role.
Mentoring takes place alongside appraisal and the assessment of performance in relation to
reappointment or confirmation of satisfactory completion of probation.
2.4.4.2 Appraisals
All staff will need regular appraisals with their line managers to discuss their progress as well as
the staff members of their own progress. It is proposed that that these be conducted at 6 monthly
intervals and should review their performance over the last 6 months and their needs/requirements
and aspirations for the next 6 months. It is also useful to ensure that areas of development are
achievable and staff progress is delivered, evidenced and recorded.

2.4.5

Welfare

Digital forensics Laboratories are often fast paced and stressful. When dealing with serious criminal
investigations it is common that time pressures are encountered as investigators are pushing for
evidential results in order to further detain, charge or release their suspect or to prevent further
suffering to victims. Analysts work need to be monitored, as mistakes can be made under pressure.
Break out areas should be provided so that analysts can walk away from the data and take a
moment to refresh. Managers need to observe their analysts to assess individuals’ workload and
offer support and intervention if casework becomes stressful.
2.4.5.1 Subject matter tolerance
Time pressure is not the only issue for analysts, as many cases will contain distressing pictures,
videos and text depicting child abuse, sexual abuse or terrorism subject matter. In some cases the
quantity of this type of material will cause stress; occasionally the depravity depicted in the digital
images will affect the analyst more. It is important that the manager aims to allocate a varied
caseload to the analyst to provide a break from the more harrowing investigations. The demeanor
20

Digital Forensics Guide

and behavior of laboratory staff should be monitored so any issues can be identified and dealt with
before they have the opportunity to escalate and negatively impact upon the health of staff.
2.4.5.2 Counseling
Best practice shows that regular counseling should be offered to all laboratory staff that come into
contact with concerning subject matter. This counseling should be provided at regular intervals of 3
to 6 months and may be more effective if it is compulsory, as staff may be reluctant to put
themselves forward for counseling, for fear of a negative perception created among colleagues. It
is important to remember that peer support is an additional powerful counseling tool that is freely
available, if this working culture is encouraged.
2.4.5.3 Succession planning
It is widely accepted that technology will continue to grow and criminals will commit more crimes
with the use of digital devices. It would therefore make sense to prepare for the growth of the
laboratory by introducing a program that trains, supports and nurtures each member of the team
to be willing and able to take on a more senior role as the need arises. Succession planning is an
effective method of nurturing and retaining trained staff. The alternative method is replacement
planning – where a totally new employee fills a vacancy. Experience shows that skilled,
experienced and qualified digital forensic analysts are difficult to acquire. Creation of a succession
plan has supported longevity and success in many digital forensic laboratories.

2.4.6

Health and safety

The laboratory manager should take responsibility to ensure the health and safety of all staff and
the visitors to the laboratory. He should conduct risk assessments by examining current conditions
and situations and addressing anything thought to be hazardous or potentially damaging to health
or safety. The manager must also be aware of any legal health and safety requirements. Health
and safety measures apply equally in respect of people that may visit the laboratory and measures
must be put in place to ensure that they do not see or are subjected to illegal or distressing
materials. The possibility of this can be mitigated by following the ideas previously provided with
regard to the structure and set up of the laboratory.
These are some of the standard H&S features that are encountered in a digital forensics laboratory:


Anti-static mats and wrist straps – reducing the risk of static damage to equipment and
exhibits.



Contaminated Substances – preventing exposure with the use of surgical gloves or other
protective clothing.



Handling/lifting - ensuring staff are aware of the correct way to lift heavy items to avoid
injury.



Rubber matting - to reduce the risk of electric shock



Circuit breakers - to reduce the risk of electric shock or damage to data.

2.5

Physical laboratory requirements

Once the location of suitable premises has been identified and the initial recruitment processes for
a digital forensics team are underway, it is important to consider the establishment of the physical
laboratory.

2.5.1

Office equipment

The size of any laboratory will dictate the amount of office equipment required.
Administrator desk - Ideally you will have a reception area that will require a reception desk
large enough to hold two monitors and two computers, a telephone and a significant amount of
paperwork. In addition, it would be beneficial to have an adjoining clear surface to deposit
incoming and outgoing exhibits and case papers to allow for the checking, documenting and
recording of these exhibits by the administrator. A chair for the administrator and chairs for visitors
could be considered. It is envisaged that this area would be less secure than the rest of the
laboratory so no case papers or sensitive paperwork should be stored in this area.
Secure property store – This facility should be large enough to store various items of computer
and mobile phone evidence for a significant period of time. Computers can come in all shapes and
sizes and some servers are very large and heavy. Conversely, mobile phones and external storage
devices could be easily damaged or lost if not stored securely. The property store should be a
secure room with access control. It should be situated close to reception and close to the Imaging
area to avoid the need to carry heavy items too far. Ideally you should install strong shelving and a
numbering system to segregate the exhibits to allow easy identification of exhibits for each case.
Consider purchasing plastic boxed to house the smaller exhibits. The exact location of the exhibits
for each case should be noted in the case management system and exhibits returned to the same
location once imaging has been concluded. It may also be worth considering isolating the secure
store from radio waves by implementing Faraday shielding. This will ensure the isolation of devices
with wireless communication capabilities. There have been reported instances of the contents of
mobile devices being remotely deleted while in police custody. A Faraday cage is very expensive
and the use of Faraday bags may be an alternative. As a last resort, completely enclosing the
devices in strong silver foil as a temporary measure will prevent communication with devices.
Forensic imaging department – The imaging department will require a large, clean surface area
preferably with raised edges to prevent the loss of screws and small components, whilst computers
are being dismantled for acquisition. Anti-static mats should be on all work surfaces. An area for
digital camera and battery chargers should be arranged, as all evidence should be photographed
prior to imaging. Each imager will require a desk area large enough to hold two monitors and two
computers, acquisition hardware, telephone and paperwork. A chair for each imager, preferably a
comfortable operator’s chair, with lumbar support and height adjustment should also be provided.
Analyst work station - The digital forensics analyst will require a large desk area big enough to
hold several monitors, two computers, various paperwork, mobile devices and mobile device
extraction hardware and tools. Again a comfortable chair would be beneficial due to the amount of
time spent sat at the monitor. It would also be advisable to position the desks to avoid others from
22

Digital Forensics Guide

accidentally viewing sensitive data on the screens – or put privacy screens between the
workstations to provide a cubicle type environment.
Server room – The space allocated to central server will need to be secure due to the amount of
sensitive data that may be stored within. It will need adequate air conditioning to prevent
overheating and will need room for resilience like UPS.

2.5.2

Software and hardware

Hardware - The digital forensic laboratory should be a high tech environment with lots of sensitive
data being analysed and stored. As such, it will require an examination network, which is isolated
from any external connections. As all laboratory staff will use this network it will need to be
resilient, secure and fast. When setting up any server or system, best practice would be to opt for
the highest available processing power and a suitable data storage array.
This system must provide Internet access to the team, either individually supplied to all hosts or
just to one dedicated computer within the laboratory. This should allow analysts and staff easy use
for checking emails, researching, downloading patches, updates and tools.
Any analyst would prefer that two monitors make their work easier. When it comes to building their
final reports it is much easier to have the report open on one screen and their investigation on the
other. It can also assist when viewing a high quantity of thumbnails. Whilst this is extra expense,
the benefits of having this viewing capability will provide time saving benefits along with a robust
system that can support the analysts provide more accurate reports for evidence.
Those responsible for imaging computers will require sanitised storage disks and write blockers to
prevent any changes in data and the integrity of the original evidence. There are numerous types
of write blockers on the market and several software tools that can also be used.
In addition to backing up operating data, the laboratory will be dealing with three additional types
of storage issues; the original evidence, the forensically created images and the data generated
after the investigation. Consideration must be given as to how this is all to be stored, archived and
backed up. A stringent back up and archive regime should be implemented to offer resilience.
If any of the digital forensic team are likely to assist with the execution of search warrants and
engage in ‘on site’ acquisitions and analysis – they will require an ‘on site’ kit (see appendix B for
an exemplary configuration of a device carrying case). In addition to a portable workstation or
laptop and the imaging tools, consideration must be given for purchasing the following equipment:


Property bags, security tags and exhibit labels



Torch



Screw drivers



Sterile gloves and clothing



Tape
23

Digital Forensics Guide



Communication devices



Power extensions, leads and adaptors



Camera, video recorder



Storage boxes or suitable container for the carriage of equipment.

Software – It is important to consider that there is not only the initial purchase but also the
ongoing cost of licensing, support and training, associated with most types of digital forensic
software. The initial and ongoing cost of licenses can be significant and research should be
undertaken before purchase to ensure the hardware and software being obtained correctly matches
the laboratories requirements and the staff’s preference. Appendix A shows an exemplary matrix
that shows how a lab manager can create a comparison between different forensic software
products taking into account the functionality as well as the cost of purchase, license renewal and
training.
It is worthy of note that some digital forensics analysts can conduct entire investigations with the
use of open source or free software – however there is a lack of support and training opportunities
with these types of product. Many jurisdictions and standards will require ‘dual tool verification’ and
additional software may need to be purchased in order for the analysts to compare and verify their
findings.
A fundamental requirement for the smooth running of any laboratory is some type of case
management system. This is a database that holds all the relevant administration information
about the evidence and cases held at the laboratory and will be fundamental to the integrity of the
analysts’ processes.
The minimum entries for a case management system should be as follows:


Date, time and person delivering and receiving the exhibit to the laboratory.



Unique reference number – software generated.



Case number or crime number.



Exhibit reference numbers.



OIC/ investigating officer/prosecutor name and contact details.



Type of crime.



All laboratory staff that have had contact with the exhibits.



The points to prove or what is required from the investigation.



Time factors – such as delivery dates and anticipated court dates.



Date imaged – who by and details of the items imaged.

24

Digital Forensics Guide



Verification hash results.



Date investigation commenced.



Assigned forensic officers and staff involved in the investigation.



Details of quality assurance by colleagues and managers.



Date investigation completed.



Result of the investigation.



Record of communication with the officer in charge of the submission.



Date and time exhibits/report were collected.

All this information is vitally important to show continuity, credibility and verification of actions and
evidence. A software database should be created by a technically proficient person unless the
forensic laboratory utilises on of the commercial software packages that are available.

2.5.3

Quality assurance/ review procedure

As with all types of evidence it is possible that digital findings will be questioned once they are
presented to a court of law. Due to the volatile nature of electronic evidence it is imperative that
steps are taken to ensure the integrity of the evidence and the validity of the findings.
It is very important that procedures to monitor the quality of the work undertaken by the
laboratory are established and implemented from the outset. All staff and managers must be fully
conversant with their role in quality assurance and should adhere to the procedures on all cases.
Random QA checks, peer reviews and administrative reviews should be carried out before a case is
labeled as completed.
Managers should consider the introduction of recognised, externally audited, standards to maintain
quality, information security and validation of forensic techniques. These standards are described in
ISO 9001 – Quality Management, ISO 27001 – Information Security and ISO 17025 - Laboratory
Validation.

2.5.4

Streamlined examination and reporting

It is sensible to introduce responsible methods of prioritising workload from the beginning.

By

having a process that identifies the more serious or time critical cases and places them on a
priority list, an effective system is created to support the efficient the staff throughput of urgent
and non-urgent cases. Risk assessment should be undertaken and decisions recorded in all cases
that are considered for streamlined activity or triage. A court should in the future be able to
examine and consider the rationale behind such decisions.
Another consideration that will support the streamlining of examination is to put in place a form of
triage. This triage will allow interim examinations to be conducted in order to establish the
likelihood of a positive result. Several jurisdictions now use a form of streamlined reporting, so that
25

Digital Forensics Guide

a reduced amount of evidence is produced initially, in the anticipation that the defendant will
accept his guilt at court. Where this does not happen and the matter is to be subject of a full court
trial, a more comprehensive examination should be carried out in good time for any trial.

2.5.5

Retention of data

In a busy digital forensics laboratory it is important to have a data retention policy in place. If this
is not implemented and followed from the beginning, a situation may quickly arise where there is
insufficient storage available at the laboratory to hold the data. This may be in breach of good
practice and the laboratory may be breaching local data protection legislation. Once implemented
there should be regular checks to make sure the laboratory is still compliant. In some jurisdictions
there are legal requirements for the retention of data, particularly in serious cases. Any such
requirements should be at the forefront of any policy.

2.5.6

Education and training of all stakeholders

At some time the preparation of the laboratory will be underway and the staff will commence their
employment. At this time submissions will be made requiring the digital examination of data. It
must be reinforced to staff and colleagues about what can be reasonably expected from examining
a computer, tablet, phone, or any digital device.
To prevent errors at the time of seizure of electronic evidence, it will be necessary to circulate
instructions and guidance to police officers, which gives them directions in order to fully consider
the implications of their actions at the time of seizing digital devices. Prosecutors and judges
should also be aware of the procedures that the police follow, in order to assure themselves that
the correct procedures have been adopted in individual cases they may be prosecuting or
adjudicating.

Digital forensics lab processes and
procedures

This chapter covers the processes and procedures that typically are involved in a digital forensics
examination. An overall, chronological process model is used in order to provide a better overview
over the main processes.
During all phases of a digital forensics examination it is vital to remember the special
characteristics of electronic evidence as laid out in the Electronic Evidence Guide.
Electronic evidence...
... is invisible to the untrained eye: Electronic evidence is often found in places where
only specialists would search or in locations reachable only by means of special tools.
... is highly volatile: On some devices and under certain conditions computer memory
(and the evidence it contains) can be overwritten (or altered) by the usual functioning or
operation of the device. This might be caused, for instance, by a loss of power or where
the system needs to lay (or ‘write’) new information over the top of the old due to lack of
memory space. Computer memory can also be corrupted or lost through environmental
factors such as excessive heat or humidity or through the presence of electromagnetic
fields.
... may be altered or destroyed through normal use: Computer devices constantly
change the state of their memories, be it on user request (“save this document”, “copy
this file”) or automatically by the computer operating system (“allocate space for this
program”, “temporarily store information to swap it between devices”).
... can be copied without degradation: Digital information can be copied indefinitely
with each copy exactly the same as the original. This unique attribute means that multiple
copies of the evidence can be examined independently and in parallel by different
specialists for different reasons without affecting the original.
Please remember that this manual is not intended to be used as a step-by-step set of instructions.
While it describes processes and procedures and provides indications of what should be considered
in all phases of a digital forensics analysis, it does not explain which features of a certain software
need to used or where exactly and in which format certain artefacts from all operating systems and
applications need to be parsed.
In addition to the explanatory text a number of useful resources have been created in order to
visually aid in the faster understanding and remembering of the processes and procedures.

3.1

Overall process model

In a case that involves digital forensics the standard procedure typically consists of four stages:

Acquisition

Processing

Analysis

Presentation

The following subchapters will explain these stages in more detail. Each stage consists of several
procedures which are thoroughly explained.
As every case is different not all of the above stages are necessary any time. Laboratory managers
can for example decide that in extremely urgent cases or cases that involve an unusually high
amount of data the acquisition step can be skipped and a triage approach is followed in the
processing phase while the analysis stage will be extremely shortened. Decisions like that should
depend on the aim of the investigation and the characteristics of the case.
Prosecutor's considerations
Criminal procedure and substantive law vary through countries and continents. The
usual division between “common law” and “civil law” criminal justice systems still exists,
but the borderline is becoming less visible and hybrid systems emerge as time goes by
and practitioners all over the world are demanding more unified and, above all, more
expedited systems for criminal justice.
The position and role of prosecutors in a contemporary criminal justice system becomes
more prominent. In most systems prosecutors are bridging points between suppression
and litigation, between discovery and adjudication of criminal acts, and between the
police and other law enforcement agencies as well as judges and courts.
Taking that into account, processes and procedures in the forensics laboratory may or
may not be under scrutiny of the public or state prosecutor, but one thing should always
28

Digital Forensics Guide

be on the mind of laboratory staff: facts discovered and evidence produced is always
going to end in the hands of a prosecutors who will be responsible to render lawful
decisions about the fate of the case and it’s perpetrator.
The aim of the investigation should always be two-fold: acquisition of all existing
evidence with regards to the case, and ability to reproduce and explain the forensic
procedure which led to the acquisition.
Prosecutors should be interested in all stages of the process, but they will most
probably focus on the acquisition and presentation stages.
On some occasions, the acquisition stage will be the first encounter of the prosecutor
with the electronic evidence in a criminal case. Often, this contact will happen during
the on call duty and maybe during late hours. With an increasing role of prosecutors
within criminal law systems, they are in charge of decision making throughout the
whole investigation process or a significant part thereof. Thus, a forensic examiner
should expect important and expedited decisions about the acquisition of electronic
evidence to be taken by the responsible prosecutor. In such cases it will be very
important that information presented by examiners to prosecutors about the
acquisition and actions needed includes all relevant facts in an understandable manner
indicating clearly the connection with the crime under investigation.
Examiners should understand a prosecutor’s questions and directions, comment on
them, provide further information and be prepared to extend the acquisition to other
hardware and software if technically and legally possible.
Presentation of extracted evidence and established facts represents the final stage and
goal of the whole process and will be covered in more detail later on in this Guide.

29

Digital Forensics Guide

3.2

Acquisition stage

Electronic evidence needs to be acquired in a forensically sound manner. Acquisition of data is
typically conducted by collecting volatile data from a running computer system during a search, or
by acquiring a storage medium from a seized computer or in any other stage during an
investigation. The application of specifically defined and tested procedures at the acquisition step is
crucial as there is an enormous scope for irreversible errors to be made. It is important to keep the
chain of custody intact at any stage, to document all steps carefully and to verify all images and
copies that were acquired.
The intangible nature of any data and information stored in electronic form makes it much easier to
manipulate and more prone to alteration than traditional forms of evidence. This has created
special challenges for the justice system, which requires that such data have to be handled in a
special way to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
Similar to other types of forensic evidence, the correct acquisition and handling of electronic
evidence are vital to the outcome of a case. Close attention must be paid to ensure that the
general guidelines are followed at all times:
Handling by specialists: Every kind of electronic device has its own specific
characteristics that require the correct and appropriate procedures must be applied. One
of the greatest risks is the unintentional modification of the evidence. Failure to adhere to
approved procedures is likely to lead to formal challenges in court about data integrity
that can undermine or invalidate the evidence.
Rapid evolution of electronic evidence sources: New technologies are invented and
develop very quickly. Consequently the procedures and techniques to be applied to them
also need to be constantly reviewed and updated.
Use of proper procedures, techniques and tools: As in more traditional forensic
disciplines, digital forensic specialists require special tools and knowledge to undertake
their investigations properly. It is imperative that the correct techniques and tools are
used for the situations encountered. The procedures must also be auditable and
repeatable by other specialists if the information obtained is to have evidential value.
Admissibility: Since the ultimate goal is to use evidence to prove or disprove disputed
facts, electronic evidence must be obtained in compliance with existing legislation and
best practice to ensure admissibility at trial.

Before even considering starting the acquisition process either the laboratory manager or the
exhibit officer must check whether the proper permission for a data acquisition exists.

30

Digital Forensics Guide

If proper permission exists, special attention should be given to the correct handing over of the
exhibits. Particular attention should be given to the following aspects:


Are all exhibits tagged?



Are all exhibits labels filled out completely and correctly?



Is the exhibit register complete and correct?



Is the chain of custody thoroughly documented?



Are there any damages to the exhibits? If so, have they been documented?



Are all security seals intact?



All exhibits, including the internal storage media should be photographed.

An exemplary chain of custody record in included in Appendix G.

3.2.1

Acquisition of computer systems

In order to preserve the integrity of the original evidence, forensic imaging technicians and digital
forensics analysts should acquire the storage media of a computer system in a forensically sound
manner as described in this chapter. The aim of the acquisition of a computer system is to produce
an identical copy or image of the original data without changing the original evidence. This forensic
copy will then become the basis of all further steps in the forensic examination.
The acquisition process typically includes the following steps:

Identification

Wiping

Connection

of storage media

of target media

of media to writeblocker / duplicator
where possible

Imaging

Verification

Archiving

of original and
copy

of image backup

3.2.1.1 Exhibit handling
Electronic evidence, as with any other kind of evidence, must be handled carefully and in a manner
that preserves its evidential value. This pertains not only to the physical integrity of an item or
device, but also to the electronic data it contains. Certain types of electronic evidence will require
special

handling.

Electronic

evidence

can

be

susceptible

to

damage

or

alteration

from

electromagnetic fields (such as those generated by static electricity, magnets, radio transmitters
and other devices) and should be adequately protected. Such a protection should include but is not
limited to wearing of antistatic wristbands, working in secured premises with access controls,
storing evidence dry storage facilities, etc. More details on how to properly handle and store
electronic evidence have already been mentioned in Chapter 4 of the Electronic Evidence Guide as
well as Chapter 2 of this Guide.
31

Digital Forensics Guide

3.2.1.2 Wiping imaging media
As the aim of the acquisition process is to produce a forensically sound copy/image of the
computer's storage media the digital forensics analyst needs to ensure that this copy will be stored
on a target medium which does not contain any other data that do not belong to the case being
examined.
To avoid cross-contamination of the target copy/image with other data (e.g. from the examiner's
files or from past cases) the medium that should hold the new copy or image has to be sterilised.
This can be achieved by wiping (or overwriting) all data on the target medium.
3.2.1.3 Write blocking
Analysing a computer device is similar to an investigator examining a physical crime scene in that
evidence must be preserved intact, as close to the original condition as possible and free from
contamination. While traditional crime scene investigators use gloves and overalls to avoid
tampering with fingerprint and DNA evidence digital forensics examiners should safeguard the data
integrity of the original storage media by using write-blocking mechanisms described in chapter
3.3.2.
Please note that using traditional write-blocking techniques it is not possible to avoid changes of
data on a solid-state drive or flash-media which include a controller chip. As soon as the controller
is attached to a power supply it will start to reorganise data on the flash chips. Techniques like
wear-levelling, write-amplification and garbage collection are common tasks that are carried out by
the controller even when attached to a write-blocking device. The only yet resource-intensive way
to create a true forensic copy of flash-media is by disordering the chip(s) from the circuit board and
then reassembles the data in the correct way where possible.
3.2.1.4 Hardware and software
There are typically two types of write-blocking methods; hardware write-blockers
on the one hand side and software write-blockers on the other. Hardware writeblockers are typically available in two different varieties; write-blocking devices
which are connected to a forensic workstation or imaging server or write-blocked
disk duplicators which image onto an attached storage medium while not being
connected to a computer system. Wherever possible hardware based writeblockers or disk duplicators should be used because they physically block write
transactions to the exhibit and work very reliable in doing so.
Software write-blockers typically involve any combination of the following techniques:


avoid mounting a file system



mount a file system read-only



change the operating systems parameters for handling external storage devices



install their own drivers and background services
32

Digital Forensics Guide

Software write-blockers are often used in forensic boot-DVDs where they are needed because there
might be no way to physically get hold of the storage media of a computer system and attach it to
a hard ware write-blocking device (e.g. flash media might be soldered onto the mainboard of
Ultrabooks).
Depending on the techniques used some software write-blockers might not block write attempts to
the disk under any circumstances (e.g. some techniques do not stop a corrupt file system from
being repaired).
3.2.1.5 Imaging process
The imaging of a storage medium can be done using specialised imaging software. There are free
as well as commercial products available which can aid in that process. Reliable and fast software
should be chosen which can produce a bit-by-bit copy or an image in one of the forensic image
formats (see section 3.2.1.7) and is able to verify the copy (see section 3.2.1.8).
The imaging software can include features like:


recognition of hidden area (see below)



imaging multiple devices simultaneously



imaging to multiple destinations at the same time



imaging queues



hash verification with common hash algorithms



hash verification at different stages of the imaging process



support the most common forensic image formats



producing encrypted and compressed images



resuming an interrupted acquisition process



tolerance to hardware errors

Finally, as part of the data integrity principle, an experienced examiner should always be alert to
the possibility of anti-forensic techniques. Hidden areas like host-protected areas (HPA) or device
configuration overlay (DCO), which are only addressable via special ATA commands can be
recognised be some of the imaging software’s.
3.2.1.6 Physical vs. logical copy
There are two types of copies; a physical and a logical one. While a physical copy includes all raw
data, a logical copy typically only includes an allocated subset of all that data. On disk level for
example a physical copy includes the whole disk including the partitioning scheme, all partitions
and even unpartitioned areas while a logical copy on disk level is just a copy of one logical
partition.
33

Digital Forensics Guide

A digital forensic analyst should typically aim for a full physical copy of a whole disk because it
includes deleted and formerly allocated areas. However, when dealing with encryption a logical
copy of the unlocked data is preferred to a physical copy of the encrypted data. There can also be
situations during a search and seizure operation where creating a physical copy might not be
possible, out-of-scope or simply not covered by the warrant or other authority.
Both, the physical and the logical copy can be written in different ways. Either they are cloned,
which means that the data is directly copied bit-by-bit from one storage medium to another, or
they are written as an image file, which means that all data is copied bit-by-bit from one storage
medium into one or more image files on a target medium. The latter technique is the more
common one as writing the data into an image file offers some advantages as laid out in the
following chapter.
3.2.1.7 Forensic image formats
Besides a raw image (raw/dd) that contains all data of the original medium within a raw file there
are a few commonly accepted forensic image formats available. Those forensic imaging formats
have in common that they are not able to be easily manipulated due to built-in checksums and
case metadata. The most common formats are the Expert Witness Format (EWF(x)/E(x)01) and
the Advanced Forensic Format (AFF). They include features like:


Compression of data



Encryption of data



Error-Checks



Case Metadata



Hash sums



Splitting the image in chunks

In addition to that, different forensic software solutions come with their own propitiatory image
formats with similar features. However, a forensic image format should be chosen that is supported
by the largest variety of software.
Special attention should be given to the image format when the image is to be analysed in a
different forensic laboratory which might use different forensic software. This is especially
important when the investigation involves multiple jurisdictions.
3.2.1.8 Verification / hashing
In the later stages of the digital forensics process all further processing and analysis is typically
conducted on the forensic copy of the data. That is why it is crucial to verify that the original
storage medium and the copy contain exactly the same data. In order to prove this a mathematical
algorithm should be applied to both data sets. This algorithm produces a very complex number
called a hash value. If the hash value for both files/devices is the same, then the files/devices are
deemed to be identical. The slightest change will result in a large difference in the hash value. The
34

Digital Forensics Guide

most commonly used hash algorithms are MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256. Since single hash algorithms
can be subject to hash collisions it is advised to use at least two hash algorithms to verify the
copy/image.
It is good practise that hash verifications are done at two points at the imaging process. The first
hash calculation should be done at the beginning of the imaging process in order to produce the
hash value of the original medium. The second hash calculation should be done at the end of the
imaging process. This second calculation should be done on both the original medium as well as the
copy/image in order to prove that a) the data on the original medium has not changed during the
imaging process and b) the data on the copy/image is exactly the same as on the original. In the
forensic imaging formats the calculated hash sum is typically stored in the metadata area of the
image. It can then be used in the later stages of the analysis to verify that the data in the image
that is to be analysed is still the same as the data that has been acquired.
Even if the hash based verification returns a positive result, the digital forensics analyst should still
pre-examine the data to ensure it looks authentic and does not exhibit any traits suggesting that
the data may have been modified or tampered with before or during the imaging process. Devices
can be self-encrypted or they can have a layer of protection that only allows communication when
the device is attached to a certain trusted platform. Imaging such devices can produce a valid
hash-verification even though the data that have been copied are not usable for a forensic analysis.
Please note that hash verification for solid-state drives and flash-media that has its own controller
will most likely fail because the controller of the medium might have changed the data while
connected to a power supply.
3.2.1.9 Copy storage / archiving / data retention
A forensic laboratory needs to have a storage facility to store backups of the forensic
copies/images. It is good practice to not only have one backup but also another off-site backup.
While the digital forensic analyst is conducting the analysis with his working copy of the image
there should still be a backup stored on another system (e.g. an imaging server).

3.2.2

Acquisition of mobile devices

As with computer-based examinations, the aim during the acquisition of mobile devices is to
produce the best possible copy, or image, of data stored on the mobile device. With mobile devices
however, it may not be possible to make a full, exact copy of the original data due to the device’s
own limitations and limitations of available forensic solutions. It may be that in order to acquire the
best image of a mobile device possible, changes may have to be made to the device to allow for
the acquisition process.

35

Digital Forensics Guide

The acquisition process typically includes the following steps:
Prosecutor's considerations
Mobile device acquisition and subsequent steps can present a legal challenge since
mobile devices are, in the majority of the cases, mobile communication devices (e.g.
smart phones). Depending on jurisdictions, different countries and their criminal law
systems may impose additional rules when it comes to the above mentioned steps,
especially the processing and analysis. Thus, there is a probability that additional legal
instruments are needed to get permission to implement this procedure. Forensic experts
should be aware of this and, when in doubt, consult with the authority leading the
investigation, which is in most cases the prosecution service.

3.2.2.1 Exhibit Handling
Forensic officers must use extra care when handling mobile devices, as they contain batteries and
can easily be powered on accidentally. This is likely to change evidential data in the process, such
as time and date information for last use. Experts should pay special attention during initial
handling to identify power buttons and to provide network isolation at all times.
The ‘Isolation’ phase is essential, as many devices require acquisitions to be conducted when it is
‘Live.’ This means that the examiner will be required to power the device on in order to use the
device functioning throughout the acquisition. If the mobile device is not isolated and allowed to
connect to external networks, such as the relevant mobile network or a wireless Internet
connection, data may be changed on the device. One example is that it is possible to remotely wipe
some mobile devices.
Isolation can be achieved through different forms:


Production of a ‘Laboratory SIM/IDEN card’ – a SIM/IDEN card that appears to the
device as the original SIM/IDEN card but lacks the capability to actually connect to the
mobile network. A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) / Integrated Digital Enhanced
Network (IDEN) identifies the subscriber to the network which the mobile device wishes to
connect to



Acquisition in a network shielded room – a dedicated laboratory with Faraday
shielding installed to prevent network isolation.



Use of wireless jamming equipment – equipment can be acquired that can jam and
prevent wireless signals from reaching the exhibit. These devices are illegal in some
36

Digital Forensics Guide

jurisdictions.
The best method will depend on local laws, laboratory set up and on the device being examined.
Consideration should also be applied to prevent connection to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals.
Before proceeding with acquiring the mobile device exhibit, it must be identified. The device will
often have an equipment label affixed to the inside of the handset, if it is a mobile telephone, or
printed on the back of the device. The label will include an International Mobile Equipment Identify
Number (IMEI), a Mobile Equipment Identity Number (MEID) or Serial Number. This data can be
used to uniquely identify the devices and is important for requesting billing records or conducting
cell site analysis later. The make, model and IMEI/MEID can then be used to look up the device
using your forensic packages to determine what level of support is available (for information
regarding the different levels of support, see chapter 3.2.2.6).
Also at this stage, a review of the case paperwork supplied with the exhibit from the officer in
charge should be undertaken to ascertain what evidence is required from the device. This can help
the examiner make a decision in regards to what level of examination should be undertaken, i.e. if
deleted data is required then a physical examination should be sort for. An attempt should also be
made to gather any known passcodes, passwords or patterns from the device’s owner prior to the
full examination. This will ensure that no matter what level of support is available for the device, at
least access can be granted to the data that is live and accessible to the user.
Once this information has been gathered, the forensic examiner should draw up a plan of action as
to how they are going to examine the device and any associated additional media cards, i.e.
SIM/IDEN cards or memory cards. This plan should include the acquisition of data from the SIM /
IDEN card(s) and memory card(s) (if applicable) and what level of exam is going to be undertaken
and why. The examiner should also plan a second level of exam in case the first level of exam is
not successful due to various difficulties, i.e. a broken or ineffective power button (see chapter
3.2.2.6 for levels of examination).
3.2.2.2 Wiping imaging media / sterilising / cross-contamination
When producing images of the mobile devices, it is considered best practice to use a clean target
medium, which does not contain any data relating to any previously examined exhibits. If using
laboratory or cloned SIM cards, examiners must ensure that the laboratory SIM card contains the
data from the last inserted SIM card.
3.2.2.3 Write blocking
Due to some specific extraction techniques, such as iOS Boot loader extractions and rooting of
Android devices, it is not always possible to implement write-blocking. Where possible writeblocking should be implemented, for example the extraction of memory cards, however it is widely
acknowledged that this is not always possible or practical when working with mobile devices. For
this reason it is imperative that the examiner is fully aware of the consequences of their actions
when handling mobile devices and is able to explain these actions in a coherent fashion.

37

Digital Forensics Guide

3.2.2.4 Acquisition process
It is important that, at all stages of an examination, the mobile device under scrutiny is isolated
from all external connections. This prevents the device from altering any stored data. A number of
modern devices have the capacity to be remotely (and securely) wiped. Isolating the devices will
help to prevent this from happening.
Mobile devices are presented with three distinct media that require separate handling and
investigation techniques:


SIM / IDEN Cards – Requires specialist mobile phone forensic tools and equipment.



Memory Cards – Can be examined as a computer hard disk or flash drive.



Device’s Internal Memory – Requires specialist forensic tools and software.

The necessary forensic tools must be provided to the laboratory along with adequate hardware to
support acquisition of these devices and examination of the data.
At this stage, the logical acquisition of the SIM/IDEN card and physical acquisition of the memory
card should be undertaken. A physical examination is not possible for a SIM/IDEN card. This should
always be carried out prior to the examination of the device itself. The memory card should only be
returned to the device after it has been examined. This is due to some handsets having data stored
on the memory card and if the memory card is not present, this could cause data loss from the
handset. If time and resources allow, a bit-to-bit clone of the memory card should be created and
that clone inserted into the handset. It is good practice that the SIM/IDEN card found in the device
should remain outside of the exhibit for the duration of the examination so as to isolate the device
from the mobile network. However, the majority of devices which contain SIM/IDEN cards require it
to be present within them when they are powered on or they are susceptible to data loss. To
combat this, a laboratory or cloned SIM/IDEN is created and used within the device so that the
device notes the presence of a SIM/IDEN card, but yet is still not able to communicate with any
mobile networks (for further isolation methods, see chapter 3.2.2.1). It is worth noting, if a device
used an IDEN card, it is often necessary to further isolate the device with a Faraday Shield,
especially if IDEN devices are common.
At this stage, if the device is supported by forensic solutions for a boot loader physical
examination, this should be carried out. Often this can be carried out without the need for a
SIM/IDEN card. This will allow the forensic solution to upload a boot loader to the device and boot
the device in a particular way, which will allow for the full acquisition of the device’s internal
memory without making any changes or alterations to the user data on the device. A physical
examination of this nature can also potentially recover any device lock codes, such as PINs or
patterns, which will allow the forensic examiner to gain full access to the device once it has been
powered on.
If the device being examined is not supported for this type of examination, the device should be
powered on whilst isolated from any networks. If user protection is encountered, and the PIN,
password or pattern has not been provided alongside the device, the forensic examiner should
38

Digital Forensics Guide

attempt the best level of examination possible whilst bypassing the protection. If this is not
possible, the user’s PIN, password or pattern will be required prior to examination. If the PIN,
password or pattern is already known prior to examination, then this should be entered so that full
access can be gained to the device. Again, the best level of examination should be undertaken to
get the most data extracted out of the device. If obtaining the correct solution for the protection is
not possible it may be necessary to attempt typical PINs or patterns in order to access the data.
This is not without risk, as many devices will implement secure data destruction should the wrong
code be attempted too many times. Commercial tools are available that can “Brute-Force”
passcodes, guessing all possible combinations until the correct one is found. When guessing
passcodes, it is best to build a dictionary of probable passcodes from known facts (such as
birthdates or other passcodes) or from known common passcodes (such as 1234, 1379, 0000 etc).
Depending on the extraction tool available and chosen, the acquisition process will vary. Most tools
have a guide explaining the procedure that must be followed to create a successful extraction. It is
important at all stages to minimise the effect on the electronic evidence and to attempt to preserve
the integrity of the data to the highest standard possible. It is important to consider that for some
mobile devices it may be necessary to modify system files or the operating system, or in some
cases upload and install a dedicated application in order to successfully extract data from the
devices. This process can cause some data to be irrecoverably lost; this is normally only system
files with little to no evidential value. The knowledge of what is altered by any of these processes
can be demonstrated by holding appropriate training certifications, such as training provided by the
manufacturers of mobile forensics software, or practical experience involving the testing of what
data, if any, on the device is altered by making these system changes.
3.2.2.5 Hardware and software
Analysis of mobile devices typically requires the use of dedicated software and the correct cable.
Some additional, dedicated tools will include stand-alone extraction tools. More advanced
examination techniques, such as JTAG or Chip-Off will require further tools, including soldering
equipment and specialist jigs to read raw data from the device’s memory chips.
3.2.2.6 Levels of examination
There are five different levels of examination for mobile devices, with the best possible extraction
being listed first:


Physical



File System Dump (FSD)



Logical



Manual



JTAG / Chip-Off / Rooting / Jail Breaking

A physical copy of the device is the process of acquiring all of the raw binary data from the storage
of the device. This raw data then needs to be analysed and processed at a later stage by software.
39

Digital Forensics Guide

This method typically will allow the examiner to access live and deleted data, operating system files
and areas of the device that are not normally accessible to the user.
Mobile devices, unlike computer devices, have further acquisition strategies. The other main
strategy is a File System Dump (FSD). An FSD is like a hybrid of a Physical and a Logical
acquisition. FSDs retrieve the devices file system and interpret the data during the processing
stage. This allows examiners to retrieve, for example, databases holding deleted messages that
may not be available at a logical acquisition and may not be accessible during a physical
acquisition. However, not all deleted data that it would be possible to retrieve with a physical
acquisition would be acquired during an FSD.
A logical acquisition of the mobile device will involve receiving information from the device and
allowing the device to present the data for analysis. This is often the equivalent of accessing the
data on the device itself. This method typically will only make live data available to the examiner. If
no other method is available, a method termed “manual examination” can be used. This method
involves accessing the device and recording the data displayed on the screen, with photographs,
video recording or transcribing the data. Care should be taken to ensure that data is not unnecessarily changed and information is recorded accurately. With this method, you can only
recover the data which the mobile device displays, for example some mobile devices will not show
full time and date information.
For mobile devices that are damaged or locked, two other methodologies can be utilised. These are
JTAG and Chip-Off examinations. JTAG examination requires the stripping down of the device to
the device’s logical board and the soldering of connections to specified connections on the board.
This enables the examiner to retrieve a full physical copy of the data stored on the device. A chipoff also allows the extraction of a full physical copy of the device, but requires the permanent
removal of the device’s memory chip from the memory board.
Another, less destructive modification that can be performed to some mobile devices is the process
known as “Rooting” or “Jail Breaking” the device. This process involves leveraging features of the
operating system to elevate the permissions of the running user (similar to the process of gaining
“Root” access in a Linux computer). This process involves the modification of system files and can
potentially damage the device and so should be low on the list of techniques leveraged.
The order of attempted extractions is important. Examiners should strive to conduct the
examination method that is least destructive with the most yield first. This allows examiners to
capture areas that might be damaged or overwritten at later stages. Methods of extraction such as
JTAG and Chip-Off should only be considered as a last resort as, especially with Chip-Off, the
process can be destructive and un-recoverable.
3.2.2.7 Forensic imaging formats
Due to the requirement to use dedicated tools to extract data, mobile phone data is often extracted
in a proprietary format. These formats can often be transfer between different tools to leverage the
strengths of different decoding abilities. Other non-proprietary formats include bin files and raw
files.
40

Digital Forensics Guide

Another source of forensic evidence is a backup. Some users and devices will create backups of
themselves on other devices, such as the subject’s computer. These backups can assist in building
a time line of evidence and can also be used to gain access to a passcode locked device. It is also
possible to analyse some backups as if the backups were a physical device. Allowing examiners to
review data stored on a unusably damaged device or a device that cannot be accessed.
3.2.2.8 Verification / Hashing
Once the data has been extracted, this extracted data should be manually verified on the device.
This will require the forensic examiner checking that the data that has been extracted by the
forensic solution matches what is displayed on the device, such as the correct time/date
information. This will identify any errors with the extracted data or if data is missing as often not
all chat messages, such as Facebook Messenger chat threads, are extracted from the device. If
there are any discrepancies then further extractions can be undertaken to try and acquire the
missing or inaccurate data or a manual examination can be undertaken to manually record the
data. Some additional data (like IMEI and application settings) are often best confirmed / acquired
during this stage.
Once all the required data has been acquired from the device in an acceptable fashion, then the
reports containing the desired data can be compiled and produced for the officer to review.
Prosecutor's considerations
Since the ultimate goal of a digital forensics process is to produce evidence to prove or
disprove disputed facts, electronic evidence must be obtained in compliance with existing
legislation and best practices to ensure admissibility at trials.
Compliance with the existing legal framework on cybercrime is of paramount importance
and it does not include only well-known laws, acts, bills and regulations concerning
criminal justice. It also includes other areas of legislation which, at a first glance, do not
have much in common with criminal law.
Cybercrime is and will be an ever-growing area of criminality. New types of crime as well
as traditional forms of crime increasingly take place in cyber space. If evidence is
gathered without respect to criminal law rules and provisions, it may be dismissed.
The responsible prosecutor, and to a certain extent forensic managers and staff, must be
aware not only of the applicable criminal law framework, but very often about laws and
by-laws which are regulating telecommunications, service provider operations, information
technology, as well as international law related to substantive criminal law, procedural law
and mutual legal assistance. For example, grounds for the retention of data and rules for
their acquisition for criminal investigation purposes are often stipulated by laws or acts on
electronic communications.

3.3

Processing stage

During processing the forensic examiners may prioritise certain devices or data and will produce an
exact copy or image of the content of any digital storage seized. Working on the duplicate (never
the original) they can apply smart, case-specific filters (data mining) or they can just process the
image (e.g. by recovering deleted files, mounting containers, breaking encryption, parsing
application data like internet history, chat logs, etc.). Those processing steps are often times
repeatable for specific categories of cases. Even though they are resource intensive needing a lot of
computing power and time they can typically be run over-night, over the weekend or on a second
forensic workstation that is not in use.

3.3.1

Processing of computer systems

Not only the number of computer systems per household and organisations, but also the amount of
storage in these computer systems is rising. Managing large amount of data while keeping the
backlog short is a big challenge for digital forensics laboratories. That is why different processing
approaching should be considered.
3.3.1.1 Case-specific considerations
Before analysing a case it is important to ask the case officer what type of data is needed for this
case. The information provided should include a scope of which data are relevant and which data
can be filtered out. Based on that information the analyst can consider which processing options
might be applicable. Depending on the case and the warrant it should also be considered which
data might be subject to data protection, legally privilege or some other form of access restriction,
for example journalistic material.
3.3.1.2 Triaging techniques
In cases that involve lots of computer systems and storage media it might not be possible for the
digital forensics lab to analyses each and every exhibit within a reasonable amount of time. That is
when a triaging technique could help. It can also be one model used in the digital forensic process
to find out quickly which computer seems most promising to analyse.
Triage in the digital forensics context is the process by which cases or activities are prioritised to
determine which case, which exhibit and which type to data are to be examined firstly, secondly,
etc. This process can include the possibility that some exhibits or data are not examined at all
(exclusive triage) or that some data will just be analysed at a later stage (prioritising triage).
Triage considers the value of investigating, the complexity, the cost and the order in which the
investigation should be accomplished.
While triaging offers some advantages there are also disadvantages that need to be addressed. A
triage cannot replace a full examination. That is why triage should not be used on a daily basis.
Using only automated techniques to retrieve evidence and/or only examining a small sub-set of all
data comes with the risk to miss evidence. Those disadvantages need to be explained to the
investigator, prosecutor or judge and based on that information they need to decide in favour or
against the triaging process for that particular case.
42

Digital Forensics Guide

However, triage remains a valid method in order to cope with a situation that could not be solved
in any other way. Examples for such situations include:


a huge amount of exhibits to be analysed in a very short time frame



exhibits cannot be stored any longer because of legal issues



getting information as quickly as possible is of highest priority (e.g. in terrorist cases)

A triaging process is typically conducted by booting up several exhibits at the same time using a
forensic boot medium. The medium should ideally be configured to run several pre-defined tasks
(e.g. search for child abuse material using hash comparison, other tasks see chapter 3.3.1.4)
automatically without the need for the examiner to observe the process. It should then write the
report with its' findings to an attached USB medium. This way a forensic examiner can process
multiple exhibits at the same time, even overnight or on weekends. The analyst can concentrate
his/her resources on the setup of the triaging process for the exhibits and can view the reports of
previously processed computers while the new chunk of exhibits is being processed by the triage
boot medium automatically.
3.3.1.3 Prioritisation of data
Prioritisation of data can be seen in close conjunction with triage. While due to time constrains or
limited resources triaging excludes the analysis of each and every piece of evidence, priorisation
would still allow analysis of all exhibits. It would however start with more relevant exhibits to see
whether this might contain enough evidence for a conviction or acquittal. Examples for a
prioritisation would be to analyze:


the main suspect's computer before witness’s PC,



urgent cases / high profile cases before low profile cases,



encrypted data before unencrypted data, and



certain data types (e.g. documents, emails) before others.

3.3.1.4 Automated processing
Automated processing is an important part of a digital forensic analysis. The scope of the
automated processing is set by the forensic analyst in the beginning of the analysis. The steps are
often times repeatable for specific categories of cases. Even though they are resource intensive
needing a lot of computing power and time they can typically be run over-night, over the weekend
or on a second forensic workstation that is not in use.
The automated processing includes tasks like:


mounting of containers (e.g. ZIP, RAR, etc)



extraction and parsing of various artefacts (e.g. mailboxes, internet history, etc)



signature analysis
43

Digital Forensics Guide



recovering deleted files and folders



recovering deleted partitions



carving for certain file types



indexing of keywords



OCR of PDF files



creation of thumbnail pictures for quicker viewing by the analyst



extracting pictures from videos



skin-tone detection for videos



hash comparison (see chapter 3.3.1.6)

While a streamlined approach is possible it is not necessary in all cases.
3.3.1.5 Data recovery
Recovering deleted data can be essential if no evidential files have been found in the allocated
areas of the disk. Data recovery is possible on different levels. First of all the forensic analyst
should check whether all partitions of a disk are shown in the forensic software or if there are any
notable partition gaps. Those gaps should be scanned for additional partitions. The next step is to
undelete files and folders from a file system. After that, additional files can be recovered by
scanning the unallocated areas for known file headers and footers (carving).
3.3.1.6 Filtering techniques
Applying filters to an image before it is being analysed can help to reduce the amount of data that
the forensic analyst has to view and analyses. Popular filtering techniques are using hash sets to
either filter out known operating system or program files (whitelisting) or to specifically search for
hash matches with databases of known illegal materials (blacklisting).
Filtering can also be applied when only certain types of traces are relevant for the case. Files can
be filtered by signature analysis, by size, by date, by owner, etc.

3.3.2

Processing of mobile devices

As with the processing of computer exhibits, the number and storage capacity of mobile phones per
household is increasing. Along with this increase, the added functionality and reliance on mobile
devices leads to a wealth of data available for forensic analysis. Examples of this data are locations
and communication logs.
3.3.2.1 Automated processing
The processing of mobile devices often requires a different approach to computers due to the wildly
varying hardware and software used between devices. Applications are updated with a much
greater frequency and changes can often be major. For this reason, dedicated forensic tools will
44

Digital Forensics Guide

automatically process much of the data, however manual verification of this processing is often
necessary. A number of available tools use a form of “fuzzy processing”, that is to say the
processing is implemented in such a way as to leverage logic and loose matches.
3.3.2.2 Filtering techniques
Filtering of mobile data is typically performed on a data type level. Data is filtered by tools during
processing into groups such as communication data and media files. These groups are then further
divided; for example communication data can be divided into call records and messages. The level
of filtering presented to the analyst depends on the tool being used, however this filtering allows
analysts to quickly review key data types, such as sent and received SMS messages and call
records to establish contact between suspects.
Prosecutor's considerations
The processing stage can be of vital importance to the prosecution. Although technical
data (evidence) is very much needed, one should not forget that the complete picture of
the case is and should be with prosecutor during the investigation phase. Forensic
expert staff in the laboratory may or may not be acquainted with legal requirements, or
may or may not be part of the law enforcement. The prosecutor, on the other hand,
more often would not be specialised in questions of information and communication
technologies.
Therefore, the prosecutor should, if necessary, consult directly with the laboratory
already for provisional findings. The laboratory staff, police and prosecutors will should
cooperate to discover and understand the full picture of the case.
Often prosecutors will not have enough time to take this approach because of everyday
routines. Nevertheless, especially in more complex cases and in cases of higher public
importance, prosecutors will need to be closely involved and closely lead forensic
investigations within the limits of the law.
Prosecutors must be aware that given the equality of arms the defence will be
examining forensic findings, including provisional conclusions, which may be challenged
thoroughly at the trial stage.

45

Digital Forensics Guide

3.4

Analysis stage

During the analysis phase the examiner actually searches for electronic evidence on the images.
This step can be very time consuming and can require a lot of expert knowledge to interpret traces
from a variety of file systems, operating systems and applications. A lot of different factors have an
influence on the time and workload that is needed for the analysis phase. Those factors include:
the amount of storage media to be analysed, the size of the storage media, the complexity of the
file systems being used, the level of usage of the operating system, the sophistication of the user,
complexity of software and techniques being used by the computer user, etc.

3.4.1

Analysing computer systems

Computer systems are used by humans for all sorts of activities: writing documents, accounting,
surfing the internet, chatting, writing e-mails, gaming, viewing and editing images and videos and
so on. That is why they can hold a lot of evidential data. Analysing a computer system, the digital
forensic analyst can typically not only find traces in relation to the case but could potentially also
find evidence regarding the intention of a perpetrator (e.g. by finding internet searches on how to
commit the crime).
3.4.1.1 Categories of digital traces
Just as a criminal leaves physical traces behind at a crime scene, the criminal that commits a crime
by computer will leave traces at a “digital crime scene”.
To get a better idea of the kinds of digital traces that an examiner might discover during forensic
analysis, it makes sense to distinguish between two types of digital traces:
Avoidable traces: These are traces that are stored by the operation system and applications by
default, but which a system can be configured not to store. Take a web browser as an example.
This software will store a suspect’s browsing history as well as details of his or her downloads, form
inputs, cookies, etc., but it can either be disabled or deleted by the suspect. Another example can
be the “Start” menu and the suspect’s Office programs that ‘remember’ which files the suspect has
opened recently. There are various types of ‘avoidable’ traces automatically stored on the hard disk
in this way (as shown in the table below). However, they can be prevented by someone who knows
what they are doing.
Unavoidable traces: By contrast, unavoidable traces are, of course, those that cannot be disabled
or those that require considerable effort to stop temporarily. The probability of finding such traces
is correspondingly high even if a suspect has tried to cover his or her tracks.

46

Digital Forensics Guide

The following table lists some examples for avoidable and unavoidable traces:

Avoidable traces

Unavoidable traces

Thumb caches

Slacks

Most recently used lists

Unallocated space

Log files

MFT entries

Browser histories

RAM

Browser caches

Some application traces

Most Used programs
Form Data
Pagefile.sys
Hiberfil.sys
Volume shadow copies
…

3.4.1.2 Procedures for different traces
Every case typically involves some particularly relevant traces. In a fraud case for example
documents, spreadsheets and e-mails are typically more relevant while in child-abuse cases
pictures, videos and communication traces are more relevant. But even within those categories of
cases not every case is the same. That is why the following subchapters included information on
procedures based on the type of type that is relevant rather than the type of case.
3.4.1.2.1

E-Mails

To analyse e-mail communication it is not only important to analyse mail clients like Outlook,
Thunderbird or Mail but also webmail accounts. The former will be covered in this subchapter while
the latter will be covered in section 3.4.1.2.4.
In order to analyse an e-mail client it is important to know which artefact that e-mail client
produces. Outlook for example stores evidential data in personal folder files such as PST, OST and
PAB files while Thunderbird stores messages in mbox files. The forensic software suites can usually
parse those files. However, they do not necessarily extract all messages. Some forensic tools, for
example, have problems extracting deleted messages from personal folder files.
3.4.1.2.2

Office documents

In cases in which office documents are of importance the digital forensics analyst should conduct a
signature analysis and then afterwards filter for the files of interest (e.g. files with a docx
signature). When the forensic analyst has found those files it is good practice depending on the
policies of the office to extract all of those files and hand it over to the case investigator for a
content analysis. When the case officer has identified the relevant documents the forensic analyst
47

Digital Forensics Guide

can search for further evidence of when those documents have been produced, by which user they
have been produced and whether they have been sent or received by other persons.
3.4.1.2.3

Pictures / videos

Most forensics software solutions offer support for analysing masses of pictures and videos. After
an initial file signature analysis and setting a filter for pictures and video files, the forensics analyst
can use a gallery view to inspect the thumbnails of all pictures for case relevant evidence. For a
faster analysis of video files certain software offers the feature of extracting still pictures from the
videos (e.g. every X seconds/minutes depending on the settings). These extracted images can then
be viewed in a gallery view as well.
If the case requires searching for a set of known pictures (e.g. child abuse material or stolen
blueprints, etc), hash comparison can be used to accomplish this task. There are even techniques
available that enable searching for similar pictures with another hash value (fuzzy hashing,
similarity hashes, PhotoDNA, etc.).
In cases where location data or production details of pictures and video files are important the
analyst should consider extracting meta-data (e.g. exif data) for those files. In fact analysing meta
data and putting evidence into context in the major task for the forensic analyst in cases that
involve pictures or videos as evidence. The simple task of viewing the contents of the
pictures/videos does not require any digital forensic expertise and could thus be done by
responsible case investigator. Besides that the categorisation of images or further investigation
may be carried out by the investigating officer if facilities are supplied.
3.4.1.2.4

Internet browser

Internet browsers are of evidential value for a lot of cases. They typically contain the following
artefacts which need to be analysed:


Website visit history



Local cache / temporary internet files



Bookmarks / favorites



Sessions information



Cookies



Saved usernames and passwords



Entries from form fields



Internet searches

Analysing browser artefacts can be important for suggesting purpose or intent (e.g. keywords used
in search engines could prove intent). That is why those artefacts should be analysed in most
cases.

48

Digital Forensics Guide

The most popular browsers are Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer / Edge, Mozilla Firefox
and Apple Safari. All of them store their data in all operating systems within the user home
directory. Except for the Microsoft browsers they all use SQLite databases to store the artefacts
mentioned above.
Even though most forensic software can parse these browser artefacts to some extent, they differ
quite a lot in a) which versions of the browsers they can parse and b) which detail of information
they can extract from each browser artefact. This is why it is important for the forensic examiner to
understand the underlying structure of those artefacts. Most browsers nowadays work on the basis
of SQLite databases. The forensic examiner should search for those artefacts and parse them
manually using SQLite database browsers. This ability not only makes him/her independent of
particular tools or the wait for updates to those tools but also allows him/her to create their own
reports and to cross-check the result of the tools.
3.4.1.2.5

Software artefacts

Whenever certain software can add evidential value to the case, the artefacts of those programs
need to be analysed. Examples of such software include communication software (e.g. Skype),
steganography software (e.g. OpenStego), password safes (e.g. KeePass), file sharing software
(e.g. uTorrent), crypto currency software (e.g. Bitcoin wallet), etc. It is not possible to describe
procedures how to analyze all potential software. The basic approach is to research trusted sources
for information on how to analyses that particular software. In a next step the findings and the
interpretation of the data need to be verified
3.4.1.2.6

User activity

The operating system of a computer tracks user activity at many different places. Examples for
that include:


power on and shutdown times



software settings



most recently used files lists



device usage



Analysing this user activity helps getting a better understand of the user behavior and can even
prove evidential activities. Depending on the operating system that has been used on the computer
those artefacts are stored in various locations. In Microsoft Windows the Registry, Event Logs,
49

Digital Forensics Guide

JumpLists and several other files need to be analysed by the examiner. On OS X systems the
analyst will find most of the evidence in the Library and log folders while on Linux systems most of
the data will wither be stored in the user home folder, the "/etc" and the "/var" directories.
3.4.1.2.7

Log files

Analysing log files is essential particularly in cases of attacks against systems. Digital forensics
analyst should extract not only allocated log files but also traces of deleted/unallocated log files.
Specialised software is available for log file analysis. The basis of such an analysis is to either
search for particular keywords, to search for abnormal pattern or to search the logs that fall within
a set time frame.
3.4.1.2.8

Encryption

All operating systems are offering built-in encryption facilities nowadays. It is easy for the user to
activate a full disk encryption for a system drive. If possible passwords or encryption keys should
either be obtained by the suspect or should be acquired by using live data forensics on scene. It
can also be helpful to extract other passwords (e.g. browser passwords) from the disk where
possible. These passwords and their permutations can be used to create a dictionary to conduct an
attack using specialised password cracking techniques.
3.4.1.2.9

Unallocated areas

Unallocated areas can contain artefacts of all of the types of evidence mentioned above. Searching
and extracting of certain file types in unallocated areas can be automated by carving software.
Digital forensics analysts should precisely specify what kind of files they are searching for because
data carving is a very time consuming task. Data carving does not work well on fragmented files.
Most of the times data found in unallocated areas cannot be an associated with a certain user or
even a location within a folder structure.
3.4.1.2.10 Cloud/remote storage

In situations where the forensic analysts finds traces of cloud services being used on a computer
system this might mean that evidential data might not only be stored on that machine but also on
a remote storage. In fact the data that is remotely stored might not just be stored on a single
physical computer, but on multiple servers in the cloud. Most of the time, even the provider of a
cloud service cannot tell on which particular server, in which data-centre, and which country
certain parts of the data are stored.
The forensic analyst could even find situations where not a single byte of data can be retrieved
from a company’s computers because they will merely be client computers without any storage
media of their own, but using the resources of a virtual machine in the cloud. The advantage with
this is that, technically, the virtual machine can be easily copied. Depending on the relevant and
applicable legislation, however, identifying and obtaining the appropriate legal authorisation for
intercepting such data might be a problem. It may also be challenging to ensure that the data have
been acquired in compliance with the legal procedures in the requesting country.
Another disadvantage is that there are likely to be far less recoverable data available to find.
Indeed if a suspect were to create a temporary virtual machine for committing his or her crimes
and then to delete that machine, there might be no evidence at all to recover.
50

Digital Forensics Guide

The possibility to acquire and analyse data that is remotely stored is highly depending on the
legislation and jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions for example the forensic analyst - under certain
circumstances - is allowed to connect to the remote storage using the suspect's credentials from
the computer in order to acquire the data from the cloud provider. Other jurisdictions will not
accept such an acquisition. In those cases the official channels can be used in order to request
preservation and access to the data from the provider.
3.4.1.2.11 Computer Memory (RAM)

When computer memory has been acquired while the seized computer was still running (as
described in chapter 3.5 of the Electronic Evidence Guide), the memory dump can be analysed in
the forensics laboratory.
Understanding memory structures of different operating systems in order to analyse RAM is a
highly technical task. That is why it should only be done by examiners who are qualified for this
work. Specialised software is requited to analyse RAM dumps. Examples for such software include
"Volatility" and "Rekall". Typical artefacts that can be extracted from RAM dumps include:


Running processes including their memory



Process information (e.g. handles)



Encryption keys



Opened files



Usernames, passwords



Unsaved documents



and many more.

3.4.1.3 Virtualisation
A picture is worth a thousand words - this is particularly true for virtualisation. The forensic analyst
can view the operating system environment from a suspect's computer the same way as the
suspect has seen it. Finding evidence from within a virtual machine can sometimes be faster and
more expressive than reassembling data traces from the file system.
The forensic analyst should ensure that the image is mounted write-protect with a write cache
allowing the virtual operating system to write log files and changes to that write cache without
affecting the integrity of the image. Some operating systems refuse to start in virtual
environments. This can typically be solved by replacing drivers and adapting configurations, using
software like OpenGates and OpenJobs. Should the virtual operating system start with a password
prompt the forensic analyst needs to either crack that password or blank it.
3.4.1.4 Process for handling mass data
Some cases involve lots of computer systems and storage media while the workload for the
forensic laboratories is already very high. A separation between forensic analysis and content
51

Digital Forensics Guide

analysis can spread the work more evenly between the digital forensics analysts and the case
investigators. The forensic analysts can concentrate on recovering, parsing, mounting and
processing of exhibits while the content analysis is being done by investigators with case
knowledge. A process needs to be in place and the software and overhanding techniques
supporting this process need to be in place (e.g. container file provided by forensic analyst to
investigator, viewer component to be used by investigator, handing back the finding to the forensic
analyst).
3.4.1.5 Visualisation aids
For aiding in visualisation of complex data structures, visualisation aids can be helpful. Examples
for those aids are:


Timelines: Indicating the behaviour of the user: When did the suspect log in, when did he
connect a certain medium, when did he connect to which wireless lan, when did he view
which website, etc.



Relationship diagrams: Can give answers to the questions: Who has met whom at which
point of time using which medium? Which information was sent/received? Who knows
whom? Who is the main suspect who coordinated the others?



Moneyflow diagrams: Can help to understand at which point of time which amount of
money has been sent over which channel by which persons.



Communication diagrams: Similar to a relationshop diagram but does not necessarily
involve persons. It could show how often which IP addresses attacked a server from
which country.

Graphical representations make it easier to understand the correlation between the data. They can
also enable the investigator to find new links. Typically the basis for such diagrams are raw data
which are stored in a structured way, e.g. csv/tsv files. Those files are loaded into specialised
commercial or some free software. On Linux for example simple commands like awk, sort, uniq
used in conjunction with Graphviz or dot can help drawing graphical representations.

3.4.2

Analysing mobile devices

Mobile devices contain records and logs of communications, along with times and dates of said
communications. In addition to this, mobile devices will also contain media files and location data
that can be utilised in an investigation.
3.4.2.1 Categories of digital traces
Digital traces found on mobile devices can be split into three distinct groups: communication data,
media files and other data. Communication data can include call records, SMS messages and other
messaging service messages. Media files, as with computers, can contain information beyond what
is depicted by the file. Meta data on media files captured with a mobile phone, for example, is likely
to contain geo-tags or other useful location data embedded within the file itself.

52

Digital Forensics Guide

3.4.2.2 Procedures for different traces
3.4.2.2.1

Contacts

Contact lists make up the backbone of mobile phone usage. Care should be taken to crossreference other artifacts of data back to contact lists to help identify subjects for investigation.
Contacts can include other communication channels, identity information as well as pictures to
assist in the identification of individuals. Contacts can also help to identify association between
subjects and potentially identify how long such an association has been in place from the created
dates of contacts.
3.4.2.2.2

Call logs

Call records often carry date/time stamps generated from the handsets internal clock. This can
make recovered time/date stamps for call records unreliable. It is often best practice to obtain
billing information from a mobile service provider to confirm time and date information for call
records. This time stamp is obtained from the mobile service provider’s servers and so can be
considered accurate (or rather it is more likely to be accurate).
3.4.2.2.3

Application artifacts

Due to the amount of different applications and the multitude of application versions that are
available, it is often necessary to analyse different artifacts unique to different applications. Many
of these applications will, for example, store settings in database files. It may be the case that
deleted database files are recovered and these can be used to ascertain the settings of an
application at a given point in the past. Due to the closed nature of many applications and the lack
of available information, it may often be necessary to obtain a test device and conduct some live
research in order to identify the properties of some application artifacts.
3.4.2.2.4

E-mail messages

As with computer examinations, e-mail communications on mobile devices can be used within
default Mail applications and through web mail accessed through the internet browser. On some
devices, such as newer Apple iPhones, the extraction of email messages from the default Mail
application is not supported. In these cases the examiner will have to manually record the data or
attempt to gather this data from other sources.
3.4.2.2.5

Web history

Internet browsers on mobile devices typically store the following information that potentially has
evidential value:


Web history entries



Web page visit counts



Bookmarks / favorites



Cookies

53

Digital Forensics Guide

The majority of this information, such as visit counts and cookies, are not accessible on most
devices.
Prosecutor's considerations
The analysis stage is of the vital importance for the identification and acquisition of
evidence used for the investigation and trial phases of criminal proceedings. One of the
most important things to be considered should be cataloguing of the steps and evidence
which is gathered and secured.
Often evidence will be present in great numbers and their bulleting and listing can be
time consuming. Nevertheless, one must be persistent in this process having in mind
that this approach will lead to a logical explanation of the chain of evidence and the
criminal act itself.
The interpretation of the evidence must be taken very seriously and its importance well
understood. Forensic staff must be aware they will be summoned by the court and be in
a position to explain their procedures and findings in detail; their statements will be
examined both by the prosecution and defence, and, depending on the system, by the
judiciary. This situation can be of crucial importance for the success or failure of the
case and it must be taken seriously.
The analysis of the evidence should lead to clear and logical conclusions which should be
able to sustain significant examination during the trial.

3.5

Presentation stage

After evidence has been found in the analysis stage, the examiner needs to create a report for the
trial. The examiner’s job is to illustrate and to translate complicated technical contexts into facts
that judges, prosecutors and other parties involved can easily understand. They may also be
expected to interpret those facts and to express an opinion on their meaning.

3.5.1

Admissibility of electronic evidence

Although the details may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (some might even not admit
electronic evidence at all), the following criteria should generally be taken into account when
evaluating electronic evidence for trial:
Authenticity: The evidence must establish facts in a way that cannot be disputed and is
representative of its original state.
Completeness: The analysis of or any opinion based on the evidence must tell the whole
story and not be tailored to match a more favourable or desired perspective.

54

Digital Forensics Guide

Reliability: There must be nothing about the way in which the evidence was collected
and subsequently handled that may cast doubt on its authenticity or veracity.
Believability: The evidence must be persuasive as to the facts it represents and the
finders of fact in the court process must be able to rely on it as the truth.
Proportionality: The methods used to gather the evidence must be fair and
proportionate to the interests of justice: the prejudice (i.e. the level of intrusion or
coercion) caused to the rights of any party should not outweigh the “probative value” of
the evidence (i.e. its value as proof).

3.5.2

Report writing

The digital forensics report reflects all the procedures and outcomes of the steps that have been
conducted before. It is the only one outcome of all the prior work and as such it is the key element
for all other persons within the criminal justice system.
The nature of the report that it is being used in courts to help proving guilt or innocence of a
person does not only make it an extremely important document but also causes some challenges
for the forensic analyst. One of the biggest challenges is to make the report understandable for
non-technical people. So a forensic report must be written in clear, understandable language and
should have a summary indication in a compact format what has been found during the
examination. All technical details can be listed in an appendix. It is important that the digital
forensics analyst does not state something in the report that he cannot prove, e.g. "The suspect
has done A, B, C"; it is only possible to state "With this computer, at this point of time, using user
account XY, file A has been created, USB thumb drive B has been attached and in inbox of webmail
account C has been visited."
A digital forensics report should consist of the following main chapters:
1.

Information about the request and the mandate

2.

Information about the exhibits

3.

Information about the examination methods (persons/software/hardware)

4.

Acquisition process

5.

Analysis process

6.

Result

An exemplary layout of a report has been attached to this document in appendix J.
In the digital forensics laboratory it should be clearly defined who is responsible for the report and
who will be delivering the evidence in court. Typically that is the same person who’s name is on the
report and who signed it. In addition to that quality assurance measures should be followed before
the report is completed and submitted.

3.5.3

Expert witness status

An expert witness, professional witness or judicial expert is a witness, who by virtue of education,
training, skill, or experience, is believed to have expertise and specialised knowledge in a particular
55

Digital Forensics Guide

subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially and legally rely
upon the witness's specialised (scientific, technical or other) opinion about an evidence or fact issue
within the scope of his expertise, referred to as the expert opinion, as an assistance to the factfinder. In some jurisdictions, expert status is decided on each and every case by the trial judge and
the person is only an expert in that case. In other jurisdictions, expert status has a more long
lasting status, by virtue of appointment as, for example a court expert.3
Evidence involving complex issues of science and technology plays an increasing role in litigation.
That is why some countries and courts maintain lists of appointed experts. Appointing an expert is
often suggested as a means for the court to enhance its ability to deal with such issues. 4
The rights and duties of an expert witness typically differ from country to country. It is important
for the digital forensics analysts to make themselves familiar with their legislation, their court
procedures, their role and their rights and duties in that role.

3.5.4

Alternative presentation methods

Some courts allow the usage of alternative presentation methods. Those can include explanatory
media such as live demonstrations on computers with projectors, virtual machines, etc. If wanted,
accepted and necessary, it is vital to discuss those possibilities with the judge before the hearing.
It is also very important to be confident in the usage of those techniques and to have tested them
before the hearing.

Digital Forensics Guide

Prosecutor’s considerations
If the aim of the investigation was two-fold, to obtain all existing and qualitative evidence
with regard to the case and to be able to reproduce and explain forensic procedures which
led to the acquisition, the trial phase is the one confirming the quality or lack of quality of
the acquired evidence.
Admissibility of evidence represents the key outcome of the digital forensic process.
Prosecutors and judges are becoming increasingly comfortable with the existence and
admission of such electronic evidence. In some jurisdictions, not only is it that electronic
evidence is explicitly allowed by the criminal justice, but there are references and
definitions of computers, computer networks, software, hardware and data in substantive
and procedural parts of the legal framework. Also, in some jurisdictions, computer data is
defined as a movable object, to which all legal rules for tangible items can apply
(destruction, alteration, theft, alienation, exchange, etc.).
Some legal opinions about electronic evidence may consider it non-usable because of the
possibility of alteration and forgery. Under this logic, any other evidence could be
questioned as well. Forgeries of paper documents are widespread. Fingerprint forgery,
alteration of photographic, video and audio materials is common. In that sense, electronic
evidence should not be regarded as more volatile or unreliable, especially having in mind
that as society, industry and technology advance, more and more of traces, facts and
evidence will exist in digital form. Therefore, admissibility of electronic evidence as real
evidence should not represent an issue for prosecutor or judiciary, provided that the
procedures described in this Guide are followed.
The authenticity and reliability of electronic evidence must be ensured throughout the
digital forensics process. Forensic staff should have knowledge or/and pay attention to the
existence of an authentic search and seizure order (warrant) by a prosecutor or judge,
records of searched and seized places, items and taken actions, acknowledgement (if
applicable) of a suspect or person in possession of seized items, that records are
authentic, and so forth. Photographic or video recordings from the place were a search
was conducted and other documents and measures, if required by law, can also establish
that understanding. Furthermore, the authenticity of electronic evidence is preserved only
if digital forensic laboratory staff continue with actions which are carefully organised,
executed and recorded.
Completeness of the evidence can also sometimes represent a difficult task, since some
parts of the evidence can be missing due to different factors and reasons, including
influence of the suspect and other persons involved in the actual case. On such occasions,

57

Digital Forensics Guide

forensic staff should concentrate on best possible approach to existing items and their
contents in order to extract the most comprehensive body of facts, without distortion or
bias.
Credibility is closely connected to authenticity and reliability and must be ensured in
writing. Written reports should provide clear explanations, logical connections and
trustable outcomes of procedures and conclusions as a result of the process. The forensic
examiner should always be aware that in case of court summoning, a verbal presentation
of the findings and testing of the believability will most probably occur. In such a case, an
examiner should possess thorough knowledge of the report, procedures and conclusions.
An examiner presenting and explaining findings in court or before the prosecution should
have certain skills for verbal presentations. He/she must bear in mind that the judge and
all parties present in the courtroom will carefully listen and follow not only the examiner’s
words, but his/her appearance and overall impression as well.
Of course, proportionality is expected. Any unauthorised intrusion or coercive measure
will most certainly lead to the inadmissibility of evidence. Also, by following good
practices of the rule of law, facts and evidence which are in favour of the defence should
be presented and made available to the defence as well.
When it comes to report writing, it is of the outmost importance that the language is
clear and understandable, but not diluted to the point where quality of the evidence will
be lost. In most situations, defence attorneys will object to more complex language of the
report and will try to advocate for additional examination for clarifying the initial report.
This is one of the frequent techniques for prolonging the trial in cases when a prison
sentence is expected. Any decision about this motion will be in the hands of the judge
(rarely – prosecutors), and examiners should be ready such a development. In such a
case, the content of the request should be carefully analysed and appropriate actions
should be taken, without prejudice to the principal task of forensic analysis as requested
by prosecutor or judge.
The forensic expert must take into account that not many prosecutors and even a smaller
number of judges feel comfortable with cybercrime, electronic evidence, digital forensics
reports and similare, and that in many cases the natural reaction is to reject the facts; in
this case, such issues should be more thoroughly explained in person during the expert
testimony. Forensic experts must be prepared and flexible on such occasions.
Te expert witness status will vary from country to country. In some systems, experts are
engaged by the prosecution and defence, in some systems they are court-appointed, and
there is number of mixed systems in which all parties and the court alike can appoint or
hire expert at different stages of the proceedings.
However, it is a very likely scenario that expert witness coming from the forensics
laboratory of the state authority will be engaged by the prosecution or court. This also
58

Digital Forensics Guide

means that the defence is likely to engage expert witnesses of their own, who will
challenge most, if not all, aspects of the expert examination. This kind of situation is
becoming more and more frequent in courtrooms and forensic experts must be prepared
for this.
Alternative presentation methods are depending on the technical facilities of the court but
not only there. Plea bargaining and, in some countries, the growing popularity of
“deferred prosecution” can lead to presentations in Prosecution Offices as well. Forensic
experts must be aware that conditions for presentation are not always perfect. Many
court and prosecution rooms are not equipped with hardware to support complex
presentations. Expert must be prepared to present the same quality of evidence with less
technical possibilities. Situations like this should be anticipated by the forensic laboratory
and certified mobile equipment for such presentations can be a useful option.
In conclusion, the presentation stage should be a goal and outcome of all efforts of the
forensic laboratory, examiners and support staff, and should always be on the mind of
the personnel involved. The facts and evidence will serve the task for establishing the
material or substantive truth, depending on the legal system. Thez will be used for the
adjudication of the criminal case, for justice and for the compensation of victims.
The role and responsibility of digital forensic examiners are thus crucial for criminal
justice.

Appendix A – Comparison of forensic software
All appendices in section A are templates and should aid laboratory managers to develop their own comparison matrix in order to make an educated decision about software, hardware
and training purchases. In some tables, exemplary data are provided for better understanding. It is important to understand that each forensic laboratory might have its’ own
prerequisites, demands and maybe even legal framework (e.g. mandatory list of court-validated software). While one lab might have a majority of cases involving recovery of files and
filesystems another lab might only have cases where large amounts of documents and e-mails might need to be analysed. While the first laboratory might choose one particular forensic
software that suits their requirements (excellent data carving, file system support and recovery capabilities) the other laboratory might aim for another solution that fits their demands
better. There cannot be one definite recommendation for a specific software that is the universal best solution for all digital forensic laboratories.

Please remember that results from each individual software should be double-checked. The ideal situation is that the results are double-checked by manually analysing the raw data.
Depending on the data and on the knowledge of the examiner this might not be possible in any case. In this case the results of the first tool should be checked against the results of a
second tool. Some legislations even require dual-tool verification legally. Thus, it is good practise to have more than one forensic software available at a forensic lab in order to crosscheck the results.

A.1) Available software for digital forensics laboratories
A variety of different software is needed in order to run a digital forensics laboratory. This includes case management software as well as feature-packed suites for computer and mobile forensics.
Depending on the tasks of the laboratory additional specialised software may be required. The number of forensic big and small software solutions is huge and very agile. Especially the open
source community is publishing new tools nearly every day. It is not the aim of this guide to provide a full list of all available tools. However, to provide a better overview that can assist in the
development of a comparison matrix a list of useful resources is given below.

A.2) Cost overview of standard software for forensic analysis
Remember: All costs for software, hardware and training are reoccurring expenses. While the initial purchase of a forensic software is usually a one-time cost the reoccurring costs for
annual license renewals should never be forgotten. Since the prices for license updates and service subscriptions may differ significantly depending on the product it is important to
pay attention to those costs. Besides that, hardware needs to be renewed on a regular basis in order to maximise the performance of the evidence processing and to meet the
requirements of updated forensic software. In addition to that even the training costs are reoccurring because digital forensics examiners need continuous professional education.

EXHIBITING INSTRUCTIONS

Each item seized will have an exhibit label attached which should be completed at the scene.
The first person to take possession of an article should exhibit that item. They will give it their exhibit reference
number.
These exhibit reference numbers must be unique and should consist of the person’s initials from their first name
and given name followed by a sequential number starting at 1, e.g., the first exhibit from Anne Browne would be
AB/1. Each person who refers to or handles the exhibit must sign the exhibit label.
Each exhibit must have a unique reference number, which should be used by all people subsequently referring to
that item.
An operative will need to show in court that an item seized at the scene is the same item produced at court.
Therefore it is very important when an article is handed to another person or deposited, such transactions are fully
documented.
Any person receiving an exhibited item must sign the relevant exhibit label, therefore maintaining the chain of
custody.
Any person who refers to an exhibit in a subsequent report or statement must include the exhibit reference
number.
If identical items are found at the same time and place they may be grouped together under the same exhibit
reference number, however care should be taken to ensure that grouped items are correctly counted, e.g., thirtyfour (34) CDs.

QUESTIONING / INTERVIEWS
All questions and answers entries regarding exhibits must be recorded contemporaneously.
At the conclusion of a seizure any person questioned should be asked if they would initial each answer and sign
the bottom of each page if correct and write after the final entry words such as “I agree that this is a correct record
of what was said” and append his/her signature.
All persons seizing exhibits should initial relevant entries and sign the page.
In cases where a person refuses to initial or sign an entry the senior person present should initial each answer
and sign each page.

If questions and answers cannot be written in one entry, continue into the next column below. A diagonal line
should be drawn through the exhibit entry column.
